    "Map Amendment for Rezoning Property in Globeville.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Direct your comments to council as a whole and please refrain from individual or personal attacks. Councilmember CdeBaca, will you please put Council Bill 526 on the floor for final passage?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I move that council bill 21, dash 526 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 526 is open. May we please have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. All right. I don't remember how to do this, so I'm going to use yourself. I started. I'm Ellis TV, and I'm here to present the staff report. 440, 12, 40, 40, 40, 46 and 4058 Foch Street. All right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we are in Council District nine in the Globeville neighborhood and the subject properties on Fox Street between 40th and 41st AV in the Fox station east area. It's just over an acre. And the proposed rezoning to see MZ eight Urban Center Neighborhood Context Main Street up to eight storeys is to reflect a trend the intended transit'",
        "'speaker_6': 'oriented development character of the area and to facilitate redevelopment. Main Street zoning allows a mix of uses in the townhouse and shopfront building forms. And the current zoning is you oh two, which is light industrial with the billboard use overlay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's adjacent to more i i aew oh two with CMC's eight to the East and some instances of CMC along Fox Street to the north and south. The current land use is industrial parking and single unit residential. It's adjacent to industrial, single unit residential and vacant uses and it's across Fox Street from the 41st and station and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'parking lot. So the middle image shows the subject property the you lucky dog dog day care. The other images are some of the residential and industrial buildings in the area. So this rezoning is within the area governed by the 41st and Fox Station East rules and regulations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So these were adopted in 2018 to limit trip generation to an area with a constrained vehicle network through requiring transportation demand management or TDM plans. By capping development and by capping development once the current trip capacity has been reached.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So CPD recommends that rezonings in the area governed by these rules and regulations reserve their trips against that capacity before proceeding with the rezoning. The applicant has reserved 854 daily vehicle trips based on an eight story mixed use development with assumed TDM measures.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The applicant has been working with host staff who are here tonight to answer questions on a voluntary housing affordable housing agreement. The agreement is for the planned rental product, with 20 units serving households with incomes up to 80% AMI over 60 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And actually, since I submitted the staff report last week to you all, the applicant has signed that agreement. So the CAP amendment of an application was unanimously recommended for approval by Planning Board in May. There are several articles in the area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'CPD has not received any comments on this application. So now we'll jump into the review criteria. We have five plans to consider in this area. So the proposed MAP amendment is consistent with several strategies from Comprehensive Plan 2040.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would allow for housing options near transit and other mixed use developments, which is consistent with the equitable, affordable and inclusive strategies shown here. And it would allow for a mixed use infill development near transit, consistent with the environmentally resilient strategies listed here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In Blueprint 2019. The future neighborhood context is urban center, which typically contains a mix of uses. The future place of this area is called Community Center, which typically provides some mix of office, commercial and residential with heights up to 12 stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Buildings orient to the street. Fox Street is a mixed use collector adjacent to the site, transitioning to a mixed use arterial at the southern edge of the site. The proposed C eight applies primarily to arterial street corridors or may be embedded within larger commercial shopping center or mixed use area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'According to the Blueprint Growth Strategy, the site is within community centers and corridors. So these areas are anticipated to see 25% of new housing growth and 20% of new employment growth by 2040. The proposed Map amendment to see MSA eight will focus mixed use growth to an area where it has been determined to be most appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The 41st and Fox station area plan was adopted in 2009. It includes a vision for a diverse transit supportive urban center. This area is mapped as pedestrian shopping district 2 to 8 stories. These areas are intended to accommodate a mix of uses with continuous street frontages.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this plan also includes recommended recommended improvements to the transportation network. While some of these recommendations have been implemented, some have not, which leaves the area with a uniquely constrained vehicle access. As detailed in the staff report, the 41st in Fox Station East rules and regulations were adopted to ensure that the new vehicle trips generated by development'",
        "'speaker_6': 'do not exceed capacity. The applicant has completed the concept review with development services to preserve the trips a development under the proposed rezoning would be expected to generate. The proposed CMS eight would allow mixed use development with a maximum height of eight storeys and an emphasis on street level activation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And since the mobility improvements recommended by this plan have not yet been completed, the applicant has ensured that the expected impact of this rezoning can be accommodated by the existing transportation network. Therefore, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the 41st and Fox area plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then the Globeville neighborhood plan was adopted in 2014, and the plan reinforces the 41st and Fox station area plan recommendations in this portion of the neighborhood. The site is mapped as transit oriented development, which includes housing, services and employment, and facilitates pedestrian and transit access.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's also in an area of change which is defined in this plan as the most desirable and beneficial location for growth. So staff found that the proposed rezoning is consistent with adopted plans. Because the applicant has worked with house to house staff to reach an agreement in principle for voluntary affordable housing agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The staff report also references housing in an inclusive Denver, which was adopted in 2018. The plan includes recommendations to promote development of new, affordable, mixed income and mixed rental housing. As I mentioned, the proposed rezoning already meets the first criterion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the inclusion of a voluntary, affordable housing agreement further strengthens an already consistent application. The proposed rezoning will result in uniform application of zoned district building form, use and design regulations. It furthers public health, safety and welfare through the implementation of adopted plans and other mechanisms detailed in this draft report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Application and staff report detail change or changing conditions in the area that justify this rezoning and the requested CMS eight is consistent with the neighborhood context description, zoned district purpose and intent. So based on finding that all review criteria have been met, CPD recommends approval.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Andrew Johnson is here from Host and there are two members of the applicant team attending virtually. Mike Francona and Isaiah Salazar. And so they'll all be available as well for questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you for the staff report. And this evening, we have two individuals signed up to speak this evening and they are both joining us virtually. And our first speaker is Jessie Paris.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Good evening. Now, for those watching at home, those that are in the council chambers. My name is Justin was here. Some representative for Black Star Action Movement for Self Defense, Positive Action for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and frontline black males.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023. I am against this redevelopment that is going on. This area is being rapidly gentrified. Many other residents have been displaced as a result of this gentrification. So to hear that you're going to put an eight story building in a rapidly gentrified neighborhood is not a good sign'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I wanted to know what if there is going to be house and built here with the am I level? It's going to be for the house and. Also, I want to know if there has been a traffic study done because Box Street is a very narrow arterial.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've known over the years it's been trying to expand it to make it wider, but it's pretty narrow. And where are people going to park? In this area to go to these shops, as was suggested earlier, the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if the or somebody from the CPD can answer that question, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Jesse. Our next speaker is Tess Storti.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi there. Oh, sorry. Okay. So I hope there's an echo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a little bit test, but go ahead and start out and we'll let you know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Once again. Okay. Sorry about that. So I agree with Jesse that it seems like we're still using the same standards that we've already brought up multiple times about the issues with these with the with the, you know, criteria.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when we're talking about affordable housing and we're still using an 80% AMI benchmark that is not affordable for the people who this is going to displace. So I don't understand why we continue. We've been talking to you guys about this since November or October, and it's now July.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we're still using the same standards that at certain certain hearings, you guys have even acknowledged that it is not that they are not adequate to to be evaluating these things. So I don't know why the planning department and you guys have not been pushing the planning department to to update the standards.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's a problem with the standards. So I don't know why the criteria. I mean, there's a problem with the criteria. I don't know why the criteria that this outdated and not adequate to meet the needs of the city are still being used to evaluate rezonings for the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's just like it also the fact that you that there that you didn't hear back from, you know, any of the of the neighborhood organizations, what other kind of outreach is being done? Because, you know, I don't know that the the the make up of Globeville is and how many how like how little parking there is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'there now. It's already been it's already been identified. And and then, you know, you have the underpass going from from like coal in five points into Globeville and that I used to teach at Coliseum Science Academy that, you know, right there is so it gets so backed up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So like when when are we going to expand that right there? You know, when is there going to be infrastructure put in place that can that can support these rezonings? Because until that is done, it doesn't really matter what the developer says they're going to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, we already can see the impact this is going to have. We don't need a developer promising so that they can get a rezoning passed. We don't need that. We need to know. We need to really be like evaluating and using our brains.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this, you know, it's just we continue to see rezonings like this and it's not effective. It's not like this is going to displace people. And until we can address the displacement going on in the city, I don't want to see any more of these rezonings get just passed through.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, do you guys ever deny anything like I haven't seen once that that happens. So I'm just curious, like, what is the you know, the only thing I saw denied was the 7 to 7 news historical preservation proposal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's the only one. And, you know, since then, like, it's just like everything else is just free for all. It's just a developer's playground. And I'm not anti-development. It's the kind of development that we are allowing in the city that is displacing people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Tess. That concludes our speakers questions for members of Council on Council Bill 526 Council members say to Barker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I have several questions for both the applicant and host. So whoever makes it to the podium first we can start with. The applicant is on virtually the same. Awesome is going to win that one. Then we can start with the department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I didn't see an equity slide in this one. We've been seeing some of the equity analysis and other rezonings, and I'm wondering why the equity side wasn't in there and also didn't see any details about the the agreement with host.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you go through the voluntary housing agreement and what levels were included in that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Thank you. My name is Andrew Johnston. I'm with the Department of Housing and Stability and the Equity Analysis. It is a newer thing that we are putting into the staff reports, and I. I don't think it was done for this particular project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, just to speak to that. So this this case kind of started a while ago. There was quite a delay with the getting it scheduled for city council. So when it was going through planning board and the staff report and everything, that was before we started adding the equity slide to all rezonings that are in these neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_6': '. At the time that this was going through, it was just if it was five acres or more. So that's kind of a this is probably the last one of that that that you'll see. So do you have a rough analysis of the equity issues in this one, given that it is in this neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't have the like the blueprint equity metrics analyzed for this. So can you talk a little bit about how you guys worked directly with the applicant and the community to come to the affordable housing agreement?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the affordable housing agreement, I'll tell you that the terms are here first and then we can go for the next step as the agreement calls for 28 units. A lot of times you see a percentage in these voluntary, affordable housing agreements, because, remember, they are voluntary and they are calling for 20 units to be built'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there because they haven't gone through the site planning process. So they're not exactly sure and they felt better about making a commitment towards units. So they're doing 20 units, which are going to be up to 80%. Am I?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the term is for 60 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And no specifics on the potential breakdown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of of the 20. Do we know if we know it can go up to 80%? But given that it's in this neighborhood and there are significant equity issues and we know 80% doesn't meet the mark that we need in that neighborhood, have we had a conversation about what is needed in that neighborhood and how those 20 units'",
        "'speaker_6': 'could be at the right army level?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we did have several conversations with the development team. They chose that they wanted to be at 80% AMI they also expressed that they had done a lot of other things in the area for affordable housing, as well as developing a student housing in the area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I believe they had a transaction just across the street that I'm not familiar with, but included some affordable housing there. Perhaps the developer team could give you the details on that. It would be a good follow up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do have the breakdown that line unit types it 20 breaks down to seven studios, nine with one bedroom and two over for two bedrooms. So the two bedrooms are the ones that we always like to see that bring in family size units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it pretty much the mix mirrors what they're anticipating. Essentially 10% of the project to be okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll ask the developer to go in depth on the affordability agreement. But real quick, can you tell me a little bit about how long the trips are reserved in the transportation plan? I know if they don't get the development done in a certain amount of time, those trips expire and they go back into the pool for someone'",
        "'speaker_6': 'else to draw from. Do we have a timeline on how long they have?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a little bit outside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My wheelhouse for that one, unfortunately. I don't know what that term is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we have anyone here who does know that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm I'm pulling up the rules and regs right now. I think you're correct, though, that if you if you haven't used your trips at a certain point, they do you lose them and they do go back into the pool for somebody else to lose.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think the timelines, it's my understanding is it's based on like the where you are in the process and they're kind of different based on different steps. So they're a couple different checking points to make sure that people are moving along at a reasonable level.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I know that there's a there's a lot of working closely with development services staff. So, you know, if somebody is is getting it, you know, it's there's some flexibility to make sure that they're not being lost for just because, you know, someone was gone for the weekend or something.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so there's a lot of working together to make sure they do move along, but they can't be just like sat on by someone who's not doing something. How many trips did we entitled this development to? This one has 800.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to say 854 and that was based on sorry, I'm going to grab my too many things. That was based on an eight story mixed use development and that is also factoring in the required TDM reductions. I will go to the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I'm good with you guys. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember CdeBaca, did you. We have both Isaiah Salazar and Mike Francona.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mike Francona.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I believe he's in the queue. Go ahead with your questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or this can be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you tell us a little bit about that? Do and how you plan to build those 20 units to an appropriate EMI. We heard up to 80%, but I imagine if you spoke with any community members, you would know that 80% is way beyond the range that's accessible in this nice neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So can you tell us a little bit about your plans for those 20 units? Why you went with 20 units, what your anticipated total units are? And a little bit about the parcel across the street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. You know so by Mike Franco and Denver. From Denver. The just talk a little bit about our history this this project is and this property is owned by the Salazar family. And we currently have over 600 beds over at the assembly student housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those beds are below the 50% AMI level. In addition, we've got over 360 beds at the villas next door to that that are also below the 50% AMI level. With that. Last year, we sold a property to the Denver Housing Authority who plans to put.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Affordable. Right across the street from this project. So when we started looking at this project, we chose to look up to these 20 units and. Looking at around the 80% AMI level. Now, that being said, there there's a chance that they're priced lower than that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that is what what the agreement was for was the the 20 units around the 80% AMI. I do know that VHA had talked about putting 200 affordable units across the street as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or are you guys looking for general population housing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, as with any project, we you know, we're we're looking to fill the building with with. Whoever wants to live there. I mean, we we are more than happy to. You know, for for us to provide the affordable and and, you know, that's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, we don't want to discriminate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I bring it up because student housing is not the type of housing that is typically catering to the neighborhood. And when there is development in this neighborhood, there are several risks of displacement for the people in the surrounding area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So trying to figure out if you guys plan to make this an extension of the student housing. Sounds like it's not keen on the property. How how big is that parcel and what was. Can you guys disclose what you sold it for?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm actually not not privy to the numbers on that. As far as the. The the dollar amount that it was sold for. I think the property, if I remember correct, is around 35,000 square feet. So, you know, just ten, you know, about 8000 square feet shy of an acre.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you talk about the people you all engaged in the community to do your community outreach on this project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So early on, we had sent emails and letters out to the the neighborhood groups in the surrounding area. And so we we reached out to the neighborhood groups essentially to see if they had any interest in in the project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Rudd groups did you gain support from?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'None of well. Only. Only one. That I recall even responded. So at this point, the answer would be none, because there was only one that even responded to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One that did respond. What was their response?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They had asked some questions of us. Asked to set up a meeting with us. So back in January I had responded and sent out several days where I could meet and then never heard back until May again. And then there's emails back and forth between May and today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Did you all end up meeting in person or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would it not?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What was that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. We know we did not end up meeting in person. No.'",

Seven of those residents that were living previously in Sun Valley will come back into those two buildings unless they choose to move into one of the other buildings and wait for that move.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So we currently under the trust grant, we have people connectors and we'll have staff.

        "'speaker_3': 'That's right. Osage Cafe is run by a youth employment academy as well. And so there's kind of a collective growth in scale that's allowing us to continue to build on the momentum that the food source has allowed us to do and on the jobs and training that go along with it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Got it. Any more? So the private development, how much land of the total DHC land in Sun Valley will be turned to private ownership?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Currently as proposed, we're looking at approximate 12 acres.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Out of how much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We start. There's 33 acres on the existing Sun Valley housing site. Keeping in mind that to help with the concentration of low income, we acquire additional sites outside the footprint and also allow us to mitigate floodplain concerns that were there, which would have precluded us from building housing on site originally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, through the infrastructure, we've been able to work with the city and our agency partnerships to alleviate those concerns that will allow us to start moving forward with building on the existing housing sites. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And does the 33 acres include the tank farm and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, it does not. The 33 acres was our existing housing site, and that includes all of the new right of way that we're required or required out there in addition to the four acres going to Parks and Rec.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So plus, we're we're considering rezoning it to a a classification that to which it wouldn't apply in the first place. How did the use overlay come to be placed upon this larger site where it is when there are no historic structures on it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How'd that happen?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you for the question, Councilperson Flynn. That was before my time. I do not know the answer to that. However, it is only applicable to residential zoned districts. You could apply it to any residential zoned district. It was applied here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Presumably the 2010 code and it will be moot if this moves to a mixed use home district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. You know, that doesn't stand in the way of my vote or anything. But I'm just curious if is now claiming that there are no historic structures to which you would apply? Why the heck was it applied in the first place?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's almost seems like we were. Or someone in the planning in the 2010 rezoning was thinking that the that the buildings as they existed at the time might be considered historic. Is that a reasonable assumption?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not a bad guess, but I can tell you that the three overlay is found in other places without historic structures currently on them. So it's not completely out of line for this to exist.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam President. I think I might ask CPD for a list of of all the applications of the new oh three overlay in the city so we can see if this exist somewhere else.

Currently, we've found the ordinance is both restrictive for organizations and commissioners, so the Commission is recommending the following language to improve our ability to disburse funds in an effective, equitable and wider'",
        "'speaker_6': 'way across the community. So a summary of these proposed changes include changing under 18 to 18 and under. That is to be more aligned with standard age cutoffs and include high school students of all ages. We are proposing to change a majority of activities to qualifying programmatic activities that would allow organizations in Denver that are feeding youth'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or providing education as only a small part of their work to be able to apply for our funds. We would like to clarify that distributed grant funds, rather than organizations overall need to principally benefit Denver residents, since it is a taxpayer fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We would like to clarify that public schools in Denver can apply in addition to DPS as an entity. So that would also include individual schools and charters in the district. We would like to change the requirement that Commissioners be a resident of Denver to live or work in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To recognize there are many folks that are highly invested in our community but may not be able to live here. We can still express a preference for Denver residents through our application materials. And lastly, we propose removing the commissioner minimum age requirement of 21 years in case there qualified and interested youth would like to apply to serve'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on the Commission. So we expect that these proposed changes, if passed, will allow more organizations across the city to be eligible for our funds impacting nonprofits and schools and neighborhoods across the city because the grant program may become more competitive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We hope to be able to invest in the most impactful projects. We also anticipate greater equity and inclusion and diversity among our members in terms of age and residency. Still, while expressing a preference for Denver residents overall, we hope that these proposed changes will improve the consistency and accessibility for community members, allowing us to better serve Denver's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'youth. Overall. So staff have given numerous presentations over the last two years about this fund to registered neighborhood organizations, other city boards and commissions, city council groups, Denver Public Schools and the Sustainable Food Policy Council about the fund and the ordinance in these various meetings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've received feedback that our eligibility requirements are there confusing. Folks often aren't sure if the organizations can apply. And so this year we received 49 responses to our eligibility form, and approximately one in three of those organizations is not currently eligible under the ordinance right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just wanted to share a couple of specific examples of organizations that could become eligible if these proposed changes are passed. So those that provide wraparound service and basic supports like Jewish family service, mental health, like the mental health center of Denver, affordable housing like hope, communities and youth empowerment and leadership like Project Voice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And those are just a few examples of many. We really believe that the programmatic work of these example organizations exemplifies the spirit of the Healthy Food for Kids initiative. And collectively, they're reaching thousands of children in Denver that these funds were meant to serve.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that is the presentation, and we're happy to take questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. We have two individuals signed up to speak this evening, both of them online. Our first speaker is Jesse Perez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yesterday evening, members of council, those watching at home, those that are in the chambers. My name is just sit with some comparison. I'm representing for Blackstar, some movement for self defense, positive action for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Frontline Black knows and I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I'm in favor of this ordinance change tonight. I supported the citizen based initiative back in 2018, and I still support it to this day and 2021. This is something that is needed for our youth. Are you need to have access to free healthy food, especially in areas where there are food deserts where we do not have access'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to free and healthy food. So I would ask that members of this Council please pass this ordinance to my and thank you for finally giving me something to be in favor of for tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right on. Thank you, Jesse. Our second speaker is Tess Dougherty, and she's online. But it looked like Tess was gone. And I just want to make sure we're calling her name in case. Okay. All right. Looks like Tess has had to leave the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that concludes our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill. Five, three, two. CNN. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 532. Counsel Pro Tem Torres.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just really want to thank the team, especially Lauren and Paige, who have been shepherding all of our conversations through for the committee. It's my honor to serve on this committee and be a part of the incredible funding decisions that are made.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I look forward to the impact that can be made over the next several years. And I can't believe I'm finally seeing you two in person for the first time. But but I do recognize that what you're responding to and I want to make sure folks know and leave.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I didn't see you over there is is the very real challenge that was faced brought to light by the pandemic in getting funds out to organizations that were originally not qualified to receive funds under the original language. And this gives an opportunity for organizations that have real reach into communities, but who may not have had food as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a priority focus of their organization. But they may have children or youth or child care or families, whole families where the the objective is still met. So I really appreciate all the work that's gone into this, and I look forward to supporting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Counsel Pro Tem Torrez and not seeing any other speakers. I will also give my thanks to the staff because this is something that was really exciting when we were able to gather these funds, but we knew that there were gaps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just appreciate you doing the outreach and then the follow up to make sure that we could widen the availability to make sure that folks were getting food, especially now, but going forward as well. And so thank you for your work on that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill.'",
        "'speaker_7': '532 Black Eye CdeBaca. Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
