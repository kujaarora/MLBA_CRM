    "Extension and Increase of License Agreement with Western Stock Show Association for Auxiliary Shelter.": [
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. Yep.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Perfect, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just a quick and dirty four from Chris. What is are. Can you go down the list with shelters and motels and the two different types of motels? And tell me, how many beds do we have total and how many are currently vacant?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can't do that. From the flash card memory I had, I can certainly follow up with a more detailed response. What I can say is, in broad strokes of proportion, again, about one third of individuals stay within motels, and within that third of individuals, they're staying in motels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The overwhelming majority of those are staying as a protective measure for long term stay within motel. So looking at identifying those aged 65 and older with an underlying health condition, who we want to move them in motel room regardless of a diagnosis with COVID, because we we know that if they were to get a virus, it would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they may well succumb to the disease. I think the last time I glanced at the number of people we had in motel room for actual activated respite, which is a shorter term motel stay for somebody who does have a diagnosed COVID condition that lasts for the duration that that disease may be contagious with the person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thinking about that two week period, those are reduced to the smaller end of double digits. So 17 to 20 individuals within that. The last I checked, I can I can get to the finer points on kind of the motel categories that we use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we can better understand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A rough, rough estimate. How many shelter beds do we have in the city of Denver?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The rough estimate for auxiliary shelters at Northwestern and Denver Coliseum right now. The rough estimate is a thousand. We know we have 300 at Denver Coliseum. I think we have capacity to go up with social distancing to I believe it's like 760 or so at Denver Coliseum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we don't serve up to that high number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had a thousand so that the thousand is our current congregate shelters. But is that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The thousand of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that including all of our shelter beds in Denver?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, no, that's including the auxiliary and national western. I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Way to get it and I have this just on my text last I looked for available beds each night was for a two week period between the ninth and the 22nd. And to give a perspective there, we had on average 543 beds that were available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that includes the on the campus between Denver Coliseum and National Western Center. It also includes looking at 48 Avenue shelter, which has been activated. And we have a capacity of about 250 there. The reason that I appreciate your forbearance, but the reason that I have for making that harder to drill down is the lot of numbers'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that were associated with our facilities pre-pandemic no longer apply because we're reorienting them for social spacing and reducing the capacity numbers that are within them. So there's still a looseness as we try to factor what is the appropriate number for a facility with social spacing has.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're backing into that, but we're following that that CDC approval for at least six foot spacing in between.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I bring it up because I think it's critical for us to have an exact understanding of how many beds are available citywide, whether that be in shelters or in motels, because we have a court order that says we should not be sweeping people if there are not enough beds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so even if there are 500 beds that are not being used at a shelter, what the city only has 1000 beds available. And we know at a minimum there are 4000 people on the street. I think that that has some larger implications.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you can get us those numbers, that would be helpful. And that is all of my questions for for you. Thank you, Mr. Connor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I appreciate it, Councilwoman. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Next up, we have Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to ask for clarification from the host team. So we have two questions. One is, what was our preference in terms of the length of the National Western Center? Is this contracting ending at our request or the request of the the host facility?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So first, want to ask about would we have extended if we could have could we have extended that we try to extend.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was the timeline that was negotiated with the owners of the facilities for our use. We did have some conversation around potential beyond this, but this was the outcome of the negotiation as far as their interest in using the facilities for this purpose as part of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hear you're trying to be very careful and I respect that. But would we have extended if we could have? We would have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Evaluated the opportunity if we could have partnered with them to look on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Gotcha. Second question, since this has been called out for a vote, what happens if this contract fails? There's the does the facility need to close immediately since this is an extension we're voting on? So if the contract fails, does that mean the shelter closes sooner?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to clarify the meaning of our vote tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or it's Lisa. Can I jump in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It would sense the time. You're right. But it would also have our responsibilities of restoring and repairing the damages to the building that we need to return back to its existing condition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let me clarify. We have an existing lease that has existing obligations to return the facility. So is there a risk that we would be in breach of those agreements if we didn't sign this agreement that details how that will be carried out?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. Okay. So it's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not that we don't have the responsibility if we don't do this contract tonight, we already have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The responsibility. Yes, that would be correct. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No further questions, Madam President. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. All right. Thank you, everybody, for answering the questions. And Councilmember Sawyer, will you please put Council Resolution 749 on the floor for adoption?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yep. I actually just have one other one last, final question in response to Councilwoman Kenney inches question, and this might be for real estate, I guess I'm just a little bit confused. I wish someone from National Western had maybe been here to answer some questions as well, because I guess I don't understand how 400 homeless individuals could'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be causing more damage to bathrooms than 650,000 users. I'm a little confused about that and I would like someone to answer that. We're going to be on the hook for renovating their bathrooms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Chris may want to respond as well. What I will say is that what we have found, certainly my involvement as we've owned a shelter, that there is a very heavy use in fixtures and the repairs are not necessarily surprising to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Chris, I don't know if you want to share.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nor nor are they to me. One thing that I'd I'd maybe suggest is that the the National Western Center has been providing a residential solution, so not non event based solution. So every one of the individuals who we've been accommodating has been utilizing the facilities multiple times a day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would say and the majority of our guests can navigate using those facilities just fine. I would be remiss to say without no, I don't want to to arrive as stigmatizing. But the reality of it is we do have behavioral issues within the population that we work with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where I mean, in particular is a facility issue that that requires special attention in the facility. At our 48th Avenue shelter facility, for instance, we installed something and you'll forgive me as it's around dinnertime for folks who may be watching, but we installed something called a muffin monster that essentially grinds up anything and everything that you could'",
        "'speaker_3': 'put through the pipes. That's that's includes fabric. That includes plastic and glass bottles. That includes metals in those kinds of things. Because because of the heaviest use facilities that provide a shelter and assistance to people in homelessness need to be created and equipped as very, very durable, hard used facilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so much like Mr. Lumley, I'm not too surprised that the plumbing issues through the course of our stay has has burdened the National Western Center and require repair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. I think Councilman Hines had one more question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or I was going to ask if it was okay. If I go to his final question and then we don't quite have this on the floor yet, so. Okay. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. And thank you, Councilmember Canady, for your for your questions. And your questions created a question of mine, too. I thought that the city tried its best to because we are obligating taxpayer funds to be maximally determinate on the amount that when when city council approves a funding request that we prove that funding request'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and don't. Create a create a blank check. So I guess this might be for real estate. I'm I'm curious as to how, in most cases, city council obligated itself to at most dollar amount and not a blank check.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yet in this case, we obligated ourselves to a dollar amount and then a blank check.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman, you are right that we would normally try to identify all of the costs right up front. This is an agreement in a situation where some of these repairs, there is no way for us to have known. We also had not intended originally when the lease was a license agreement was negotiated to be here as long as'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we are. Which factors also into. Maybe some of the additional repairs that we now need to make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I mean, I guess I'm not sure necessarily what kind of answer I expected. I'm not sure I am satisfied with that answer. I am pretty sure that I don't think that this is the right venue to demand the right answer right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So perhaps we can chat about that at some point in the future. I just want to make sure that if we're committing taxpayer funds that we know that we can be open and transparent about to the people who elected us what we're committing to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and we don't say we're giving you these funds and oh, on the back end we might give you more funds. So I just, I, I understand the situation that we're in now. I just I want to make sure that I can be as transparent to the people who elected me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, everyone in my district, including the people who didn't elect me. And and so that's I guess that's just a larger question that I have that may not be specific to this particular contract. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to add one point. I appreciate all of the questions related to the costs, and I understand and agree with Lisa's point as far as not being able to necessarily anticipate some of the repairs that have come with the scale of this use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would just say, as you're considering this contract, that there are resources as part of this extension are reflects the obligation to bring the facility back to the state that it was prior to our use. So they're important resources as part of that contractual term, but it's also important for us to be able to have enough'",
        "'speaker_2': 'time to make the transition out of this facility strong with the steps that Chris outlined earlier or so, giving us the time in August to connect back to some of the facilities where if this did not pass, that runway would not be long enough to make the appropriate connections for folks to existing and planned facilities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just want to reiterate the importance of the time and resources as part of this extension to both uphold that contract and also make sure that we're supporting a strong exit of the facility for the guests that utilize our services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been a thoughtful plan that's been outlined by Chris to support residents who are moving to other facilities. And we want to make sure that that's a strong process and well supported for guests to make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. All right. Councilman Sawyer, will you please put Council Resolution 749 on the floor for adoption?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got it. I move that council resolution 20 dash 0749 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, great. It has been moved and seconded comments by a member of council. Council member sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks so much. I, i, i have my concerns about this. I understand why it is important that it move forward, but I am going to go ahead and vote now. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sawyer? No. Torres, I. Wow. I. CdeBaca, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Question. I h I see all. I. Council president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am secretary. Close the voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One night an ice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten ays Council Resolution 749 has been adopted. The next item up is Council Resolution 597. Councilman and CdeBaca, please go ahead with your questions on this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to call this one out and 598 out just to ask questions about how these two entities are providing services that are reimbursable. We have lots of contractors and I'm just not sure what exactly they're doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for Liberty Waste Management, where where are they operating and what makes their service covered reimbursable?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, gentlemen. See you back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is Chris Ulrich with General Services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I cut out I had to re logon to zoom for the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First part of your question. But I believe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're asking what makes services reimbursable for FEMA expenses? Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What makes these two particular contracts reimbursable? Ross and Liberty.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So the services that are being provided in addition to their regular services, we have three levels specifically for COVID 19. So for the Liberty Waste, we have deployed a number of hand-washing stations that are specific to kind of help mitigate the transmission of COVID 19 among the public and including those affected by homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In addition, we have also deployed additional portable toilets throughout different parks in other parts of the city. As Scott had mentioned in committee, again, to kind of help spread or not spread, keep the spread, keep the COVID 19 from spreading throughout the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's kind of how these two are applicable, is providing those extra services, including hand-washing stations and the portable toilets. They are reimbursable expenses, Roth Property maintenance, because we have added disinfecting and high touch area cleanings. Those items also become reimbursable under FEMA.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we have worked with our FEMA coordinator to really understand what it what can be reimbursable and really the process for getting these items reimbursed. And so by that language, it allows you to then go ahead and submit very detailed invoices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those services that we can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Get reimbursed in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. And so Roth is just our cleaning company, and Liberty is doing that for the bathrooms and hand-washing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. So Roth is our regular citywide janitorial contractor, excluding Dan. So, yes, they do clean all of our city facilities and have up that disinfecting and correct the clear selections, agreements for portable toilets and hand-washing stations citywide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just one question. If we wanted to add in washing stations and portable toilets, I know that some of my constituents are asking for them. Can we expand this program and expand FEMA reimbursement? And if so, would that be additional vote for that would come before city council?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a great question. So under this contract, we can add facilities, additional sites that are citywide without having to amend. We already have the ability to do so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which is how.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We were able to already add those hand-washing stations and portable toilets. So if that is something that you would.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like to pursue as part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of your office, you and I can kind of have that conversation online to talk about the process for doing so, right? It's as simple as we get a quote. We know that funding initially, whether we can tie that just to our special revenue fund, which I assume we would and do those things reimburse schools.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's a conversation that we can kind of have to to add those. But it's a very easy thing for us to add.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would be interested in that. So thank you. And thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just real quick. Thank you, Madam President. How many do we have in Civic Center Park right now? A great question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me look at my spreadsheet and I can give you. So in Civic Center Park, it looks like we have a total of three hand-washing stations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And porta potties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do not see that we have portable toilets in civic center, at least not on this spreadsheet that I have. Unfortunately, I don't think Scott Gilmore was able to make this meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Awesome. While we will be pulling together a request to get some of these out in the communities. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman, are you good on 598 as well? Okay, great. Thank you. All right. Next up, we have council resolution 6680. Councilwoman say to Berkeley, go ahead with your questions, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have the power to waive the accrual of interest. I'm wondering if there's power to waive the taxes themselves and in what cases we would be able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, City Council. Thanks for having me. And Councilwoman CdeBaca. No, we do not have the ability to waive the taxes. Property taxes are governed by state law, state constitution, the Colorado Revised Statutes. So there are specific laws and regulations in place that govern govern that in the city does not have the ability to choose to tax'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or not tax specific property owners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what gives us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The authority to waive the interest accrual?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Late in the session, the Colorado General Assembly passed a statute authorizing counties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Waive late interest for a payment interest on late payment of property taxes for this year, only a result of the COVID in the timing of COVID rates to when the property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tax payments were due.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so is there any have we made any accommodations for people who can't afford to pay their property taxes right now? What what exists to be able to help people get their houses out of delinquent status right now without first having to come up with the money to pay their taxes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So from a property tax collection, the city has has no programs in place to assist. So basically what we have between.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'June 15th, which was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second half payment deadline and October, which is when the tax sale takes place, we reach out to the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Provide them delinquent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Statements, and give them the opportunity to pay the taxes up until October when the tax lien sale goes into process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So does the mayor have under his emergency powers, emergency authority? Does he have any power to change retroactively the taxation rate that we selected as a city?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do not know the answer to that question. That would be a question I'd have to have city attorneys opine on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Has there been any other circumstance in our history of a time when a tax rate was selected at one point in the year and something happened and that tax rate was retroactively changed?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not that I'm aware of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's essentially no relief at all at the city level for business owners and resident at property owners related to property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not not through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Department of Finance. I'm not aware I'm not sure if Human Services or some other city agencies have programs in place to assist folks that are struggling with making making payments on whether it be property taxes or rent or what have you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the Department of Finance does not administer any programs to provide that kind of assistance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman, this is Kiki Turner Communications for the Department of Finance. Building off of what Steve said, that partment of Human Services does administer a property tax relief program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm sure I can help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Follow up with them and get some on on on that program. It's the rebate and that is I brought it I said, without having to pay their taxes first because in order to get the rebate, you have to front the payment for the taxes first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if that's the program, I'm already connected. But thank you. And that concludes my questions, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. We have Councilman Hines up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, it is the hindsight of Oscar show tonight, I guess. But so my question is. I believe that property taxes are allocated or they are earmarked for entities. And this is part of the reason why we are required to collect them for state law.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I want to verify that what I think is the case is actually the case. And specifically, I think 65% of property taxes go to DPS, Denver Public Schools, is that right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It kills behinds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So from 65% of Denver's property tax goes to Denver Public Schools, and there are several other special districts that administer a property tax. And then there are other components of the property tax. Denver's. Denver has a piece of the overall property tax mill levy that that we administer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But you're correct, well over 65% goes to other entities, not the city and county of Denver. So if we didn't collect property tax in the first place, Denver public schools would be an even more financial trouble than it already is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does that? If they did not remit the funds back to Denver. I'm sorry, I'm making a value statement. How? But I take the value out of it and make it a factual statement. If we did not collect those property taxes, then Denver Public Schools would not get a significant portion of its funding for for the school district'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Okay. See no other questions on resolution 680. We'll move forward. We're moving to additional questions. And Councilwoman CdeBaca, you had a question on Council Bill 665. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Lisa, is it possible for you to let us know how many leases are affected and if it's not a long list? Could you read us who those leases are with?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, give me 1/2. Let me just pull one up. It is with 50 to 80 enterprises. We have two of those locations, that is Subway, we have coffee, etc. Gosford. We have the Denver Center for Performing Arts. We have Giant Corporation HP or it should be convenience, which is Brussels in the world building National Western Center Authority'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And I think my last one would be the Wiltshire Events Center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so what is the, the total. Amount of dollars that we are going to forego in these negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman, I need to be clear that actually this is not rent forgiveness. This is rent that will be added all on the back side of their terms. So their term is extended and there and is and it actually then is stepped up to reflect that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they will be paying actually a little bit more at the end of the term than they would right now. I do not have the total dollar amount per month, but I can get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Awesome. Thank you. That concludes my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Up next, we have Council Bill 676 and councilman say to go ahead with your questions, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just curious about the language in this. Multiple small impact changes. Is there anybody who can speak to what that language means and what we're talking about here?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. It's Susan O'Neal from our class in com. And every six months we put in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Two of these.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Small impact changes through city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council. It's a protocol.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That we established a few years ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For studies. The impact. The impact is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Less than 50,000. It doesn't affect more than 25 employees. There's no more than five classifications and there's no more than three city departments of agencies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so who who are the. What are the titles? The five. You said no more than five.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And so this there were 15 classifications that were changed up. There was an outreach trainer, a revenue development series, a criminalist series. The development of a real time crime center technician lead an infrastructure program manager, a photo enforcement agent, too, because we really had a one time chief and deputy chief, probation officer, forensic director and forensics'",
        "'speaker_4': 'manager. So those were new titles.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Not that I am aware of. No, for that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'What I want is for eminent domain. No, we I'm trying to think I want to be careful on that because there's something that makes me think we have. But no, I think what we've done is we've managed to find.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I will double check myself and I can respond back to you after this. But not that is coming to mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is what are the factors that go into deciding whether it is worth it or not to pursue a parcel for eminent domain?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman? I think it is. It depends on the project, quite frankly. But at the end of the day, as I shared with Councilwoman Sawyer a number of months ago when we talked about eminent domain, that is not something that the city looks at lightly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it is normally the last resort that we take. But it is only if, at the end of the day, we need the parcel for the project. And we can't complete the project without it. That is what would normally then move us forward in our discussions on eminent domain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what? But what exactly makes a project? Something worth fighting eminent domain for. When when we just discussed this parcel, there already is a trail around Sand Creek and the inconvenience is just that an inconvenience. But what makes it rise to the level of taking property to make it less inconvenient?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What I would say for this particular one is knowing that there are other future improvements along the creek that need to be done, that there are grant dollars associated with this particular area and property that the city needs to and has at its disposal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That and knowing that without going into any detail that we had already had some prior conversations with the owner, that that is what made this appear a viable candidate for eminent domain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those conversations with the owner resulted in him saying that he refused to sell his parcel. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman, at this point, because those are still negotiations and because the land acquisition ordinance, I would I would be not comfortable discussing it. The negotiations right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And who is the company that we contract with to acquire parcels pre eminent domain.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do not contract with a company to do that. Either we negotiate in house or on certain projects, especially if we have relocation, then we may use one of our right of way consultants. But we we did not use a consultant to have this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. And so there's. So HD pack is not a regular go to for us for these eminent domain acquisitions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They may be a consultant that we use. And whether the city uses them or they are sometimes a sub with the engineers, we do utilize them, especially though for any of the relocation projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is the value of this project? If we were to pay for the relocation and the acquisition without having to go through eminent domain?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what Councilwoman, at this point, again, I don't know that that's something that I'm comfortable discussing right now. There's a very specific process. We would need to go forward under the Uniform Relocation Act, and that includes valuation. So we would need to wait and determine that with appraisals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is there a public repository where residents of Denver could look up parcels that were acquired through eminent domain or pre eminent domain? Work with one of our consultants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm trying to think how to answer that for I'm not sure what you mean by preeminent domain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I can explain. I've been part of one of the eminent domain or several of the eminent domain acquisitions for National Western and for I-70, and helping community members navigate that. And the unfortunate part of it is they don't get considered to be eminent domain unless they actually have to fight in a different level of court for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that. But they end up getting approached by the city. The city's consultants tell them it's eminent domain. Tell them that if they they don't settle, if they don't agree to the price, that they will not they will not win in a court case for eminent domain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I've been a party to multiple eminent domain acquisitions that don't get called eminent domain. And so I'm wondering how we as the the general public could look back on the information that I'm asking you for now that you can't disclose right now after it is done?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, certainly, once the project is completed and I say that because with eminent domain, depending on the funding sources, they have to be reviewed by C dot. There's a whole process that goes through that. And then if somebody wanted to profiles, they could because they won't just be on a Web site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That being said, there is a very especially when we are using eminent domain that the city uses regardless of funding the Uniform Relocation Act as a guideline. And so there's a very specific process in which we have to go forward, and that includes letters, notification, timelines to respond.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's very prescribed. So I am I don't know how to respond to what you have experienced, but what I will say is for all of the eminent domain projects that I have worked on during my career that has when we go out, it is recognizing it is distributing the Uniform Relocation Act.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is why if we use a consultant, the consultant is the first to say that they are there to also represent. They are not just representing the city, they are representing the owner, tenant, whomever we're speaking with to make sure that we are following the Uniform Relocation Act, which ensures that there is a fair process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So real quick on the relocation act. Eminent domain proceedings are not required in order to relocate somebody under the relocation Act.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, that is correct. We if we were able to strike a negotiation regardless whether it's a project or not, that involved that if that was part of the negotiation. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so what do we call.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That on a project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What do we call that before it rises to eminent domain? But they're working with consultants to basically be moved under the relocation act. What is it called? What kind of acquisition is that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That would still be just a negotiated, negotiated acquisition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. So there's no special way we classify pre eminent domain negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not as I understand what you're asking. No. And that's why I say we're very careful in how we do the conversations. We have to make sure that we if we go down this path, that we are following the federal guidelines that we need to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So do you recall or in your career with Denver, how many acquisitions where eminent domain was authorized actually ended in eminent domain?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do not know how many. I will say the percentage and I'm happy to try and get you a number is relatively small. Of truly ending up in court.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But several actually acquired without ending up in court, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, but it's still under under eminent domain. But yes, we still then negotiate forward based on the I'll use and then that is always our goal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. Thank you. That concludes my questions, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I do want to Miss Lumley. You reminded me, and I totally would agree with you. I do see that there are times when we would use eminent, eminent domain. Say, for example, you mentioned improvements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a matter of civil rights. So. So it isn't as if I'm against eminent domain as a as a a tool by itself. I just want to make sure that if we're taking someone's private property, that we are we are measured.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we don't just do that on a on a whim. So. I I'm trying to understand. This seems to be more inconvenient rather than civil rights or public safety. Because there is an existing path. It's a little longer than going directly on the feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So has has Denver. I know that there are because this is an ongoing discussion. You want to be careful with what you say. I don't know if you can answer this, but has Denver been in contact.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the property owner?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. When this transaction is complete, assuming we agree to eminent domain, will we have the opportunity to examine the level of contact with the property owner?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I mean, I understand what you're asking us and it will be documented going forward, certainly. Like I said, it's very prescribed once this is in place on the on how we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And is it I'm surprised I haven't heard from the property owner at all. I mean, you know, are all the council members email addresses are are pretty discoverable. So is it inadvisable for the property owner to provide comment or is it is it should we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. I guess I'm kind of at a loss as to why the property owner I mean, if you've reached out to them and you say, hey, we want to buy your property, we're thinking about taking your property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the property owner still doesn't say anything. I'm just trying to figure out, is it is it because they didn't know? But it sounds like they knew that the city was interested in the property. So I'm just trying to wrap my arm or arms or head or whatever brain around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This while also respecting that you can only say some things and you can't divulge the full the full grito.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What I would say is the majority of owners probably do not reach out to you to city council in general under our land acquisition ordinances. I know that there have been a few over the last couple of years, but in general, we do a number of these, as you mentioned, for some of our other roadway projects, the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'ADA projects that you never hear from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I would imagine the 88 projects would be pretty cut and dry, like we're taking it. It's a matter of civil rights. We have to. It's our obligation as a government entity. And, you know, so I don't see Sand Creek as necessarily the exact same, whereas there may be a defensible argument.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess what I'm getting at is maybe the property owner. Has a reason to what? Eminent domain? I don't know what that reason would be, but but I'm curious. And after this all ends, I would be curious to know the results.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's why I was asking if we'd find out later.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And thank you, Madam President.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'You're right, because at that point, we need to follow the federal guidelines.

Because they and actually, I'll be honest, they had reached out to us because they had heard that we had an interest'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in this parcel when they acquired it. And so to have general conversations is fine. But then that's what are if we really think that this may be a path that we are going down, then we want to be very careful about what we say and what we do so that we never misrepresent the city's interest and that'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So this is my name is Karen with Landmark Preservation, with community planning and Development. And this is 44, 43, 45 West 46th Avenue Landmark Designation Application. It's located in Council District one at the corner of Tennyson and 46th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the applicant is Councilwoman Amanda Sandoval and the owners is Ben and he will be on the line in a moment. So some of you may be familiar. This came through and you guys saw it over the course of the last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the spring of 2019, a demolition application was submitted for this property. After the notice was posted, members of the community submitted a designation application as it went through the course of LPC and City Council processes. There were a large number of discussions between the community members, the developer and the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Through the course of those discussions, there was an agreement where the property was sold to a preservation minded buyer. They are planning on reusing the property and are then going to look at redeveloping the rest of the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The property boundary is noted in red on the left here and so the property is close to the property at the rear in the side, but encompasses the front lawn area on 46th and along Tennyson. This is the first property that's coming through to you as a designation under the new criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the requirements in order for a property to be designated is that the application must be complete. The structure must maintain its integrity. The structure must be 30 years of age or of exceptional importance to fit it. Younger than that, the structure must meet at least three out of ten criteria, and during the deliberation, the OPC must'",
        "'speaker_2': 'consider the structures historic context. For this particular property. It meets five out of the ten criteria and we'll go through each of those first and has a direct association with a significant historic event or historical development of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a direct association with the historical development of the city. Howards Mortuary started in 1917 and it became one of the most successful and longest lasting mortuaries in the city. It was operated as a small family family funeral home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Throughout the time, they emphasized that they had longevity and ties to the community with their slogans that emphasized Denver's heritage as it over the time they began to expand their services to include a variety of different options and services as they grew and provided more services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They also wanted to expand their locations, and when they were looking to expand, they looked at the suburbs to the north of Denver. They were initially in downtown Denver. And so there was a substantial amount of growth in Denver after World War Two within Denver proper, as well as the metro regions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they found that the Berkeley area was underserved. And so Robert J. Howard, who was the son of the founder and the head of the mortuary, provided a quote to The Denver Post that they look to the north in Denver as the best fit for the Berkeley Park site expansion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the site and the location of this particular property is directly tied to the development and growth of Denver. Second, this property is embodying the distinctive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Characteristics of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Architectural style or type. In this case, it's a type which is the funeral and mortuary type. It's not one that you guys typically see. So we wanted to provide a little bit of what are the character defining features of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So funeral and mortuary types tend to be 1 to 2 stories in height. They're often located in residential neighborhoods, so they're designed to fit in with the character of the surrounding neighborhood. They're designed to accommodate at home, accommodate hearses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's pushchairs or large garages. And then they typically have a mix of specialized uses that would only be needed for a funeral home, such as viewing rooms, storage areas and casket sale rooms. The property at 4345 West 46th has many of those character defining features, with a height being both one and two stories that is architecturally'",
        "'speaker_2': 'distinguished with the chapel. There's report reposing or slumber room, a display room, a variety of garages and a couple of pushchairs. And so it meets the criteria of having the distinctive, physical, distinctive, visible characteristics of a type. It is also a significant example of the work of a recognized architect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was designed by J. Roger of Music, who is a well-known Denver architect. He works solo as well as as well as with others. He's most known for working with his brother in music and music. They designed a variety of different properties, a couple of which are Denver landmarks, and are listed on the National Register of Historic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Places. The First Baptist Church in the Webster Elementary School. He also had a partnership with Charles Cordingley, where he actually designed a chapel for it in Lakewood that was used similarly for funerals and weddings. It has been demolished.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He also worked with Howard to do the Howard's Hampton Memorial Estate. So he worked with the Howard family and did their memorial estate as well as designing this chapel for them. Music emphasized the importance of the Berkeley Chapel in his career.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In an interview when he was asked to select one of his top of his four top five works in the 1950s and 1960s, he identified this as one of his most important designs. And so it's a significant property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As the architect himself said, it was one of his most important works over two decades period. And so the Landmark Preservation Commission and staff found that it is a significant example of the work of a recognized architect. It is also represents an established and familiar feature of a neighborhood, community or contemporary city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Due to its prominent location and physical characteristics. So it's located at the intersection of 46th and Tennyson. And this is an area that is a kind of where the commercial and the civic areas in this area meet. It was advertised as being at the entrance to Berkeley Park, which you can see in the background of those photos'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And it's very prominent placement at the corner. This large building size, the materials make it a focal point of the community and an orienting visual feature. And so it was established and familiar feature of the neighborhood. And finally, it promotes the understanding and appreciation of the urban environment by means of distinctive physical characteristics are rare.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this has a variety of distinctive physical, physical characteristics. So it has the Gothic and Tudor arches, the portrait of Portico in the Berkshires, the stained glass and leaded glass windows, including the rose window in the chapel. The exceptional terracotta ornamentation, which I have photos to show in a moment, mean the really the substantial sides.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So all of these are very distinctive physical characteristics and they are also very rare for the Berkeley neighborhood and for postwar construction. So staff in the LPC found that it met this criteria as well. And here's some images of the physical characteristics and the terracotta.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These photos also demonstrate that the property has a good integrity. Overall, the property maintains a very high degree of integrity. You can see on the bottom what was a rendering of it when it was constructed in what it looks like today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There have been very minimal alterations. The clay tiled roof was replaced a couple of years ago after a hailstorm destroyed it. And then the decorative terracotta, if you noted in the photo before, is painted red. It was originally historically blue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But overall, the building retains good integrity and the commission found that it maintains its integrity. And finally, when the ABC was considering it, it looked at the historic context and noted that it had been constructed as part of postwar growth and strongly relates to Denver's rapid expansion and suburban development after World War Two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you look at the chart at the bottom, they'll tell us red lines. Note the growth of the city in the 1950s. And there's there is this extraordinary growth on this chapel was constructed. So the LPC considered that historic context when reviewing the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Community Planning and development received. I received letters of support, one from a community member and then five from organizations or community groups, all in support of the designation application. And so CPD staff and the Preservation Commission recommend approval of the property over 30 years of age and meets at least three criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It retains its integrity and the LPC considered its historic context. And I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone might have. Thank you, Cara.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For that report. Tonight, council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 200648. And we have three individuals signed up to speak. And our first speaker is Ben Gerhart.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello? Can everybody hear me? Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, Ben.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, great. Thanks. My name is Ben Gearhart. I'm a resident of the Berkeley neighborhood at 3931 Julian Street. Also here with my business partner, Charles Moore. And we're really excited about this day. We want to thank City Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want to thank city council, historic Berkeley Regis and also historic Denver and the residents of the Berkeley neighborhood. It's been quite the journey to get to where we are today. And I thought that this was a great opportunity to let everybody know a little bit about the programing of the chapel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As everybody had told us that it was almost impossible to program a mortuary that was specifically designed to be a mortuary. And we identified a great tenant and redemption church. And Christ is here with us tonight. And just to show you guys a little bit of their setup.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They've got their heavy equipment and. Their pews social distanced and have been holding service here since March. We also have found another tenant who's a montessori school, and that person will be signing the lease in the near future and the rest of the space will be used as event space for weddings, an amenity for the community and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'other corporate events. With the parking lot over the summer. We've hosted a summer concert series and our first event was about two and a half, three weeks ago, and that was the Garth Brooks Drive-In event, which was fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have about 5 to 6 more events, including a farmer's market for the parking lot through the summer. But again, I just want to thank everybody for the opportunity to speak and I'll leave it open any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Ben. Next up, we have Thomas Simmons. And we're going to need you, Thomas, to raise your hand in the attendees so we can get you in to our panelists.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see. We see your picture. Up there, so. Okay. Well, we're going to go on to the next speaker and he Levinsky is our next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Good evening. I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Historic Denver and a resident of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver. Our offices are at 14th and Ogden Street and just wanted to participate tonight to offer my support for the designation of the Howard Mortuary and echo what Ben said in expressing gratitude to Councilwoman Sandoval for her help in facilitating the negotiations and discussion that went on among the community members and the property owner last year and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'demonstrated that with a little bit of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Time and that opportunity to talk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Things out, there are great resolutions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And ways to save historic buildings and still.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Accommodate new development. I also want to thank Ben and Chuck immensely for stepping forward and taking this project on. They've been great partners on other historic buildings in our city, including the award winning Essex apartment conversion and Capitol Hill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're really excited to see what will happen with the building moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And excited to have another mid-century modern, although it's a revival style. So people may not realize at first glance that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is from the mid-century era. We don't have too many of those. And so looking forward to helping to share that story. And in closing, I want to thank the community members as well and the leaders from historic Berkeley Regis for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Their patience and their perseverance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In trying to find a win win outcome for this, as well as to the property owner who was also patient and agreed to a few extensions to help make this possible. So thank you so much. Looking forward to seeing the outcome here and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That Ben and Chuck will be able to use the preservation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Incentives that we have in Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To make this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A successful community space.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Annie. And we have Thomas Simmons in the queue, so go ahead, Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Mm hmm. Go ahead. Okay. I'm showing you the interior of the chapel, I hope.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's just your name. So I don't think your video is up or working.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, anyway, I'll go ahead. There we go. Okay. There we go. So this is the interior of the chapel bin. Showed you a little bit of the chapel. The chapel does have a hand crafted plaster ceiling with the ribs there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, you're seeing some of the people that helped on the the application in terms of supporting it. Last year, more than 800 people signed a petition supporting the application of the chapel and a number of other people contributed to a Go Fund Me enterprise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We engaged in the facility, facilitated discussions that was described by Ben, and it reached a successful conclusion in a remarkably short period of time. New owners took possession in February, and they preceded this promise to proceed with a Denver landmark application.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think Kerry did a very good job of summarizing the reasons that this building is significant. I met five of the ten criteria. This is one of the first ones under the new landmark criteria, and we're very happy that it worked as well as it did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would emphasize the significance of this building as a mid-century mortuary type. It's not the, if you remember, Six Feet Under Fisher and Sons. This is not that type of mortuary. This is a mid-century mortuary, a very large footprint, a very specialized building, and reflects the evolution of the funeral industry in the mid 20th century.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other thing, and I think the pictures show back here, really reflected the amazing terracotta used in this building. This is one of the last projects in Denver, one of the last big projects of the Denver Terracotta Company, one of the big terracotta manufacturers in the country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it was very lavishly adorned with terracotta. From the columns to the arcades to the friezes, to the gable faces. It's a really nice display of terracotta in this part of town. Finally, in undertaking this project, a number of people came forward expressing their memories of the building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was a very difficult time saying goodbye to a loved one, but this was a place where they could do it with dignity and they remember it very fondly. The relationship between the mortuary and the people of the neighborhood and this whole part of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we urge you to approve the application, and we'll be here to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Simmons. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Flint.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you. Kara, I wonder if Kara could answer a question about the boundaries of the designation, which seem to just hug the contours of the building and leave out the remainder of the total two acre property. Are there any plans for the portion that's left out of the designation and how does the designation affect what can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be done with the remaining net of the two acres?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So the boundary was drawn pretty tightly around the rear and back of the property. There weren't as many character defining features there to allow for the flexibility of re-use of the rest of the area. And in order to get sort of that win win of allowing someone to be able to pay the pay to buy it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then be able to recoup the costs, it was a way to allow for the re-use. Since it was only a parking lot, it did not have a lot of character defining features, didn't contribute significantly to the to the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so by excluding that it allows for the redevelopment of it. On why also preserving the most important part of the property. So it was intentionally drawn and they worked with us to find a boundary. It's about, I believe, five feet off the back of the building so that they can do what they want without actually impacting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and touching the building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And maybe I don't know if Councilwoman Sandoval also would like to to speak to this, but does the designation of the structure have any control over the use of the rest of the property so that the rest, whatever happens off the off the designated area does not detract from from the designated property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanking Councilman Flynn, I will ask that the owners, Ben and Charles. I know you and I have all talked about the impacts of the MAX three zoning that we are allowed to use. Could you talk about what your idea and the architecture and what you would like to see on that surrounding area because it does not have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to go through designing a you. I'll a firm call.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. We have been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I'm. I'm here. Can everybody hear me? You know, our focus right now is to really program the chapel and to get the event space and the Montessori school built out. We have looked at development around the chapel from anything from senior affordable housing to affordable housing to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Conservation and just leaving it as open space to potentially a community pool that serves the community to the townhome development. We've looked at every option out there and at this point we have other projects in our pipeline and other historic preservation projects in that Midwest that we're just focusing on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I can't really answer that question from a design review perspective. I think Landmark would be the one to comment on that. However, everything that we do develop, we obviously are going to be as tasteful and use the materials that are as close to a design review that they could get from a landmark perspective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're residents of the community and want to see quality product. And this is a legacy piece of real estate that we're going to hold in our portfolio for a long time. Thank you. So maybe, Carol, if you could if you could wrap that up, the, uh, and the designation of the, of the mortuary does not have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'any controlling influence over the design of the rest of the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, that is correct. And that's why the boundary was drawn that way, which allowed for redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate Ben, I appreciate your your explanation of the whole range of obviously a wide range of potential uses for redevelopment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. You know the questions from council. The public hearing for council bill 20 dash 20648 is close. Comments by members of council. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. So, as my colleagues have learned this year, I asked your support to vote this down a couple of times as it came forward to us hoping to work on this agreement that's here in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for those of you who may not know my little story, we all got elected on June 4th, the new five of us, 2019, I became councilman elect and I got a phone call June 6th about this property and the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Demo permit and the fact that it meant a certificate of non historic status it was eligible to get landmark. So I worked with then Councilman Espinosa and we hosted a meeting at a school not far from there. And unbeknownst to me, it was packed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was hot. It was in July, right before I got sworn in. The air conditioning was going on. And I knew immediately right then we were going to have a tough road. Coble was the potential buyer, and they were slated for what had looked like some flat homes that were not well received in northwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the history quickly, we just put in a file. I filed a non owner. Designation. Application? And I asked. I met with Coble several times and I asked them if they would go willingly to mediation. And I said, Sometimes you just need a mediator.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sometimes you need a therapist to mediate between parties that cannot talk. I mean, they literally said that I think sometimes you need couples counseling. This is like that. You can't hear each other because there's a lot of high emotion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we facilitated Steve Charbonneau facilitated several meeting and they were very contentious. It was hard. And they came up with a resolution that if we found a buyer, they would let go of their contract. And I will give a shout out to Ben and Charles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That contract was one of the most tricky contracts I have ever seen, and they still went through with the project. So we are now here and this is the first landmark of its kind to come, of its kind to come under the new ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So on behalf of the community, I decided to become the applicant. Do you see, you know, there's an $850 fee associated with a non owner historic designation and that was all raised by a Go Fund Me account. So I don't remember how many donations were made, but tons of donations were made enough, enough and more, and then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some to cover the $850 fee. So this was not just. This was not just a. The historic Berkeley Regis. And there is not just the historic Berkeley Regis. A part of this, that this was a larger community. So this meat, as we just talked about the new criteria, this is the first application under the new criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's a little bit fuzzy and I think it meets the new criteria and on its merits and also in the new criteria, there's a pie in that apple in that period right now for non owner historic designations that I know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Black, you worked on this ordinance. I know Cabinet Council members worked on this and this is the first time that this was used even before it was in ordinance. So if you are any of you have questions about how that process worked.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Feel free to reach out to me and I can give you the rundown of how it worked and wins and losses. So with that, I just really would like to. I really think my community, Big Tom and Laurie, thank everyone from the Berkeley Religious United neighbors even though they are not they're not mentioned it's the our now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it's an honor to fulfill my role as a county council person and vote on something that definitely meets the criteria and is also a first of its kind by using the past period to come out with a better negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I would miss the support of all my colleagues. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I also have, in some ways, a special place for this. This rezoning and his historic designation. And because, as as my colleague, Councilmember Sandoval had mentioned, we were just starting when when this rezoning was kicked off.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also Tom's Diner, which was in District ten. And and that that was a firestorm. Tom's Diner made national news. We got emails from all over the nation, some beyond actually talking about Tom's Diner and the that actually the idea of someone being able to take his property without his permission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Speaking of the eminent domain conversation that we had earlier tonight, but it's I'm really excited and I want to thank Councilmember Saint of All for all her hard work. I want to thank historic Denver and the property owner and so many other people for for what obviously took a lot longer than Tom's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Diner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fight. But but appears to be obviously a far more amicable solution for for the property owner, for the neighbors and the community around it. And and and it appears that there's some really good uses that are coming out of it as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to thank everyone for for measuring twice and cutting once. So I also will be supporting it. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval, for your hard work and your for your support. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much, Madam President. I don't I just want to give my kudos as well to the folks involved and really proud to see this conversation go from something that I recognized as something that community in northwest Denver was really going to dig in their heels about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what emerged, I think, was a councilwoman who could really mediate and listen and apply what she knew about land use in the city. And it was a really incredible thing to watch that took place over the last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I really just want to praise all those who came into this with open minds and wanting to arrive at an agreeable place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for the fact that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are preservation minded developers and reminding community that that exists. So just thanks to all involved in including the community in the area knows that these things really can come out conciliatory for all involved. So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then the. I. Sawyer. I. As I like I say tobacco. I. Twin. Herndon. I have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Passion. I can change. Sorry, I. Comedian. I'm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see her in muted, but I didn't hear her.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I didn't either. I think she might be frozen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's circle back around.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, Madam President, your last. I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did we want to see about Councilwoman Kimmich? Okay. I think she's frozen, so. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ten Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, ten eyes. And Councilwoman, can each just let me know that unfortunately, she dropped off out of the meeting, so that wasn't intentional at all. So congratulations, Councilwoman Sandoval, on the success of this, your mediation, and congratulations to your community as well.'",
