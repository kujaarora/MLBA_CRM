        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Called this one out for a vote. This is a company that coincidentally I had asked about. I think it was last week or the week before when we were talking about the eminent domain authorization over down on Sand Creek.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a company that did the acquisitions for National Western Properties, and I was fortunate and unfortunate enough to work with several community members through that process and was really able to see how this company is not necessarily a company we should be contracting with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There were multiple instances where they were shortchanging the homeowner on the value of their homes or what they would be offered for a relocation and big enough discrepancies that would have amounted to tens of thousands of dollars that community members would not have gotten for their properties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I will be a no on this tonight because I have firsthand experience with this company. I also did not appreciate the way that they engaged with community members, and I hope my colleagues will take it from someone who's worked directly with this company that they are that we should be looking for somebody else.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I see Alyssa Lumley is in the conversation. Are there homes that are under consideration for property acquisition?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Did you make the council? Councilwoman Torres? No. These are businesses. This is part of the Broadway corridor improvements. This agreement with the park to be very clear, park right now is a sub from the engineering firm. We are using them in this contract for relocation only.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not an acquisitions and this is to ensure, again, that we are following our Uniform Relocation Act and providing all of the documentation I know that we had provided to think of before a presentation with Rene Goebel, our litigator, and I am happy to send back materials for counsel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If there's any interest on this right of way acquisition process. But there are no residences as it relates to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then if it's relocation, only who then owns the property? If we're not acquiring.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The property, we are acquiring it. The dollars being funneled through this particular agreement are for relocation only. Oh, got it. Thank you, Hope.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, counsel. Or Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. No questions, just comments. Just wanted to hopefully welcome Dr. April Alexander to the Citizen Oversight Board. She is our city council appointment and wanted to stress the importance of making sure that City Council has a role in appointments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is an appointment who was beyond qualified? Who is a member and a representative of Black Lives Matter and in the context of global uprisings? For the Black Lives Matter or Black Liberation Movement. She was passed up by our mayor for his set of appointments, and I think that this is an example of why Council's voice and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'insight mattered to these processes and mattered to appointments. So just very thankful that we had a second shot with her and very hopeful that my colleagues will approve her tonight. There's no voice more valuable right now than someone from the movement that is characterizing our experience.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I think they are skeptical of this getting to the ballot and don't want to commit until we commit. But our commitment is our vote and document it tonight to get there. And that commitment has been made to me repeatedly that if we refer this, then their initiative comes down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to be clear about all agree with that. And I guess I have no reason I have no reason to doubt that. It's just I recall when we put the public financing of city elections on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe that the that the ordinance the bill that put it on the ballot specifically stated that it would it would be on the ballot at the who was I forget the name of the committee that put it on the ballot, but it was contingent on their with on their commitment to withdraw.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Democracy for the People initiative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Yes. This is an agreement that we made within the task force as well. I guess. Okay. I guess I don't I don't have any reason to doubt it. I understand that. But the other question I had was about the statement that 26% of sales taxes are paid by Denver residents, only 26%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I find that really hard to believe. Like I called the Department of Finance to ask if that's what they what they have. Where did that come from? We have 700,000, 700,000 people here in Denver. They buy cars. They buy big items.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I find that I find that an unbelievable figure. What's the source for that? I wish it was a number that was put in front of us at the task force. I have not confirmed it by any means, but that was the number that was put in front of us at the task force.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And who who put it in front of you? I honestly, I don't have a recollection of who that was. Okay. So I think that's highly implausible that only 26% of our total sales tax is generated by people who live in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When you buy a car alone, it's it's $1,000 sales tax for getting the figure right now. Councilman Flynn, thank you for your concern, though. Okay. Thank you. And maybe financial callback before roll call.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Sounds good. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 20684 is closed. Comments from members of Council. Councilman Clark.'",

And so I won't rehash what everybody said about the urgency of this, about the need for us to address this and about why it's so important and how COVID has shined an even'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bigger light on why it's important, because I think many people have said that better than I could. I just want to say thank you to again to the task force members who worked really hard on this as volunteers, to the city staff who worked on this, to the to the mayor's office and to again, to my colleagues'",
        "'speaker_1': ', both who were pushing for this. And in all of those early meetings and for the ones who were pushing back on this to make it better and to get us to to get us to tonight, a huge shout out to resilient Denver, who I think pushed the city and and as we heard, will continue to push us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'towards, I think, good things and to our our awesome facilitators for really a one of a kind task force that I got to hold before. You know, I think that, you know, this is the first step that the task force has put in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as Councilwoman Canete said, you know, one of the easier things that nothing about solving the climate crisis that we face is going to be easy. But this is a case where Denver voters already will have something in front of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have the opportunity to put something better that has consensus from a wide range of people who are brought together specifically to hash these issues out and come to something that everyone could live with to help us get to where we all, I think, on council know that we need to get and that's the choice before'",
        "'speaker_1': 'us today is is to give voters a better choice this November and then it's up to them, but a better choice on building that base and really showing that we are committed to doing what we need to do as a city to solve the climate crisis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to say thank you to everybody. Thank you to all my colleagues who've been so engaged in those pushing for it, pushing back on it, making it better, crafting it. I really feel like this came from the task force but belongs to all of us.'",

Thank you, Councilman Clark, for all that you have done in putting together this task force and being the voice in pushing this forward and being the person who has pulled all of this together for the year that I have been on council and even before then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your leadership in this is why we are all here doing this. So thank you for this. And thanks to the task force for all of your hard work. You guys are amazing. You have done an incredible job. And, you know, like I said, in in committee, my my biggest fear is in sending this to the ballot right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now is that it is so incredibly important that this passed. And my biggest fear is that people are so concerned with the financial crisis that is happening right now, that they will not pass it. And that that just terrifies me because it is so incredibly important that we pass this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I will be supporting it tonight, and I hope that people will support it in November. I am I am so concerned that they won't, but I hope that they will. And, you know, so so thank you so much again, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A Thank you, Madam President. I guess I'm when I think about the task force and the recommendation that came forward on a sales tax, and that was at the Broncos, Coach Saban, who made the who went for the tie, a very unsatisfying tie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And he had that famous quote about about a tie game I sat in as an observer on, I believe, all of the all of the task force meetings. And I appreciate all the work that went into it. I witnessed a lot of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I encourage my constituents to take part in the opinion survey. And what struck me about it is that the sales tax of all the revenue options that were on the table in the opinion survey that was up for about a month and a half.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sales tax was the only revenue raising proposal that was opposed by most of the respondents in the public survey. Other than I think there was a late last minute extra tax on meat and dairy products that somebody threw on the table.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And given that, it seems to me like this is because we couldn't reach we couldn't determine a way to make better solutions work that actually change behavior and get at what we're trying to change through this through this effort, we settled on the default the easy way out, which is sales tax, which is regressive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I agree with Alexis Morris, one of our speakers earlier, that this is a very regressive tax, despite the promise that the revenue will be used to be spent more equitably on those communities. It's still a very regressive tax and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My fear beyond this is that this week we'll hear a proposal from a councilwoman, Connie Chung, on a sales tax for services for homelessness. And I believe that is the and that is the thing that I believe is appropriate for the sales tax to be used.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to put my support behind that. And in doing that, I feel that we're asking too much from our voters right now. This will put us up at 8.81% sales tax. If both of these were to pass and my my intent is to support the homelessness sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I almost wish that Brazilian Denver's initiative would be the one to go forward. And then maybe. Work with that one, flawed as it is, I think this one is flawed as well. I think I would rather see the resilient Denver attacks go forward than this one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I probably be the only no vote on this. That doesn't mean that I oppose the efforts that the revenue would be used for. I just think the way we're raising it, it's not the appropriate way to do it in this time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. It's not often that I agree with as many points as I do agree with with Councilman Flynn, but I agree with many points he raised tonight. And I think that it's it's really disappointing that we took a whole year to get to a sales tax, considering what we started out with and what is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'currently on the ballot. With the Resilient Denver Initiative. I thought that was more courageous, more complex, but definitely more courageous in shifting the burden to our commercial and industrial users. This is, we know, overburdening the people who will who we're trying to help and who will be faced with this competition of a sales tax for climate change'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and a sales tax for homelessness. I think that it's unfortunate that we're putting both of these in front of them at this time. And while in principle, I support always giving the voters the power and sending this to to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think our voters are smart and I think our voters are frustrated about how we use tax dollars and when they see tax increases on the ballot. I don't think we've given them a reason to pass any of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so what what I. Fully expected to happen may well come true and we might strike both sales taxes down because we're just giving this to them at a very inopportune time without a lot of proof of our ability to manage their money wisely in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'll support getting this onto the ballot. But but I don't support another sales tax. I really don't. And I think that even with our analysis of the numbers that our friends from the task force shared, it shows just on an estimate, a rough estimate will be paying more as individuals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With this tax than we would with the other tax. And I think right now that's not what what our constituents want or need. But thank you for letting me share my comments and I will support to get it on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I personally will not be voting to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Seen no other hands raised in the queue. I'll go ahead and provide my comments. You know, I was part of the group of council members working with Councilman Clark to do something, to do something that we were going to be able to hopefully address the immense disparities that are in our communities of color, specifically'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in regard to climate change and the impacts of climate change. And one of the biggest pieces that we wanted to make sure was that those dollars, whatever the funding source was, was that those dollars got back to the very communities that needed this help and support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to point out to folks who are maybe on this meeting, but on page four of the actual bill request in Section seven, we didn't talk about it in the questions, but that the funds would be expended on permitted uses, allowing for flexibility to take advantage of one time opportunities or catalytic projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': '50% of the dedicated funds would go directly to communities with a strong lens towards equity, race and social justice. And that is one of the pieces that that is so important. And that gained my support of this, among others.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to thank the members of the task force. It was a hall for all of you in day long Zoom meetings with breakout sessions, and the conversation was so intentional and deep to try to figure out what we could do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know that there are concerns about the ballot, about the time in history that we are in right now. But I want to provide the voters of Denver the opportunity to weigh in and have their say on this.'",
