        "'speaker_3': 'Is been moved and seconded. Comments from members of Council. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I had a great I had a great opportunity to see Dr. William Rich's work firsthand. He has been very instrumental in making sure that health care is a right in this city and not a privilege.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dr.. Milenkovic is responsible for so many people, countless people and countless families in this city and in this state, their ability to see a doctor. We can only imagine just how impactful that has been in our city and for our families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are countless individuals in our city that have their mothers, their fathers, their children, their family members in good health, alive and in front of them because of work that Dr. Paul Milenkovic has led. Denver Health is one of the greatest hospitals in our nation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was born at DG in 1978. If you are already, you probably delivered me. Who knows? So thanks for not dropping that. Although I do have a little mat right here. I don't know where to throw it. I've seen you in action, Dr. Milenkovic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've seen you in board meetings. I've seen you in community meetings. More recently, I've sat in a meeting that was very proud, very proud moment to see Dr. Milinkevich talk about the new Southwest Denver Clinic in Southwest Denver to be completed, actually to break ground in September and be completed within a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From what I understand in that year, hopefully, weather permitting, there are so many people that benefit from his work. Dr. Milinkevich, you have been a tremendous, tremendous individual, a tremendous asset to our our community, to the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm sad to see you retire, although judging from him and from your work and your attitude, I know that this isn't the last time we see you. I know you're still going to be around. And I've also heard very funny stories about Dr. Milinkevich, and especially on why he wears a bow tie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, I heard that you wore a tie at one point, but some kid threw up on it. A baby? Oh, you wiped his nose on his tie? No. And that's why he wears bow ties. Nothing more. I'm sure that hasn't stopped some other little patient from trying to do that as well, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it looks good on you. I mean, I've never seen a bow tie look better on a man. And you almost want to make me wear one if I could tie it. So, without further ado, Mr. President, I just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to thank you, Dr. Milenkovic. I know I'm not the only one that's going to make comments here, but, you know, on behalf of of the countless people I know, there's the majority of the folks that Denver health serves are able to go for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, to my and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts, thank you for serving our community in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I remember when city council had to vote to allow the school based clinics to exist. You remember the chambers was packed. We had people concerned that the schools were going to be handing out condoms to students.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And some of my colleagues on the council at the time were very concerned about that. And it was a very controversial issue. But to realize today that we have over 120,000 students actually being served, many of whom this is the only opportunity to see a doctor, to get preventative care and to make sure that if something is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'identified, that it's being treated. And so the work that you have done over the years in not only with the school based clinics, but with the clinics that we have in the community. I know that when clinic started right next to Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Denver Health played a role in that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can remember when Quick Newton had a clinic on their site and Denver Health had docs that worked out of there as well too. To know that we have a first class health care system in this city that serves everybody and that indigent people receive the same quality treatment as somebody that ends up there that was in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a car accident that can afford to pay for their health care is is just amazing. They know it's a teaching hospital. We have a lot of people that come through there that are getting their doctorate degrees. And basically we are getting state of the art.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Folks that are helping ensure that, you know, any of the latest diseases and things like that are being treated with with first class equipment as well, with all the upgrades that have taken place on the campus over the years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just want to say thank you for your years of service. I want to thank your family. I see you have family members here for their allowing you to be able to do this job. I know it takes a whole family that allows us to, you know, to do the work that we do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I just wish you Godspeed in your retirement. I understand you're not going to go too far. So look forward to any additional contributions that you will still make. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Are there any other comments from members of council seen on Madam Secretary? Roll Call.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lopez. Hi, Nevitt. Hi, Ortega. Hi. Rob Shepherd. Sussman. Brooks Brown. I thought I. Can each. Hi, Lehman. Hi, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Secretary. Please close the voting. And now the results.'",
        "'speaker_0': '12 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_3': '12 eyes. Proclamation 623 has been adopted. Councilman Lopez, is there anyone you would like to call to the podium to accept this award?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I would like to invite Dr. Gonzalez and Dr. Paul Milinkevich to the podium. Mr. President and members of council, it's a delight to be here on this occasion to acknowledge Dr. Paul Milenkovic. You know, we do three things at Denver Health and we try to do him very well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of them is research, and Dr. Milenkovic is what you would call a researcher's research. His prowess at bringing in national level grants at very high levels speaks to not only his ability, but the ability of the team that he has trained and the work that he does.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also do teaching, and Dr. Milenkovic is a teacher's teacher. He's taught many of the senior leaders that we have at the medical school and through the medical school at Denver Health, as well as medical students, residents and people who have become and assumed leadership positions at Denver Health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in terms of service, which is highest and foremost, what we try to do, he is a doctor's doctor. Many people seek him out for his opinion, for his wisdom and his guidance in the work that we do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is a great loss, I think, for Denver Health. And one of the nice things about Denver health is we have so many senior caring physicians who represent the conscience and the heart of Denver health. And the bad news is sometimes they think they're entitled to retire and have a life besides the Denver health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're working on that. I have tried to recruit him back to the hospital in a volunteer capacity or any kind of capacity. But he says, I have to talk to his wife and she's here. So I'll work on that this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But finally and most importantly, he's been a mentor and a guide for me in my first two years, and I'm pleased to call him a partner and a friend and he'll be missed. Thank you. But I had to make a couple of notes because if not, I would be talking forever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I don't have any slides, so I will try not to talk too long. You know, when I when I first working started working at Denver Health back then Denver General Hospital, I actually had no idea that I would spend my life and my whole career there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My first position was actually as a pediatrician working at a clinic, which now no longer exists. I was working at the Hyde Park Clinic, which at the time that I first started working there, was in the basement of a church on 32nd Street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I still remember Mayor Webb's mother coming in occasionally to that clinic to tell us what we were doing, usually what we were doing wrong. Sometimes she would tell us what we were doing right. But I still remember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that that was my connection with community. I mean, that was community health. We were here to to take care of the community and to listen to what the community felt we needed to be doing. Now, 37 years later, this is a very different health care delivery system that I started working at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that it it has grown substantially through the leadership of many, many people. And it has done a lot to support the health of the Denver community, but it still has not turned its back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most underserved residents of this community. And I think through our community health program we take care of almost 130,000 patients, most of whom are low income and without us would not get the care they deserve. And it's that commitment to the mission of Denver Health that's really kept me coming to work every day and enjoying it almost'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all of the time. I really do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Think I'll miss it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because it's been a great place to have a career where you feel like you're making a difference. I want to thank City Council for the recognition. It's it feels good to be recognized and I feel fortunate to have been part of that work, although I must say that I have not done this alone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is I have been part of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I've been fortunate to have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great support from administration, from prior administrations. And now Dr. Gonzalez, I've had great support from staff, many of whom are here, who've worked really closely with me to get done what we've been able to get done. And I think most importantly, I've had the support of my family and a wife who's been considered enough to let me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do what I wanted to do. Most of the time, I, I think without all of them, nothing that we've accomplished in community health would have happened. And and so I have to thank them and recognize them for this achievement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.'"

    "Supplemental Appropriation for Liability Claims Settlement.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'It has been moved in second to comments. Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to reserve my comments for the other piece of legislation and just simply say I will be voting no on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilwoman five Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to indicate the same message that I stated last week that I will be abstaining from both of these votes tonight because my daughter works for the sheriff's department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Any other comments from members of Council on six 2213? None, Madam Secretary.'",

    "Resolution to Settle Liability Claim with Jamal Hunter. ": [
        "'speaker_3': 'One nay, one abstention. Council Bill 622 has been placed on final consideration and does pass. Councilman Lopez, will you please put a resolution 647 on the floor for adoption?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'President, I move that council resolution 647 series of 2014 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It has been moved and seconded. Comments from members of Council Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. The ordinance that we just approved moved money through a supplemental from one fund to another. In order to facilitate the resolution I'm going to be addressing just so people understand what the relationship was. I will be voting no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is not the first settlement I have opposed during my time on council. In a few of those cases, I felt the city employees actions could be justified and a settlement never should have been proposed. But I have to tell you, this is not such a case.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What happened to Mr. Hunter shouldn't have happened. I'm truly sorry for what he has been through, including pain, suffering and permanent scarring. A second reason I have opposed settlements in the past is that I found the dollar amount to be excessive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is such a case in my mind. There should be a strong nexus between the dollar amount awarded and the severity of permanent injuries to justify the amount in front of us tonight. Those permanent injuries would have to be catastrophic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The council has been privy to comments the plaintiff himself made. About his own current physical functioning. I'm very pleased for Mr. Hunter, but I do not see damages of $3.25 million. Also, what kind of precedent and incentive to such a windfall settlement set for other potential cases?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the meantime, I fully support the mayor's actions to review this department from top down. The third party reviews called for in the settlement are important too, but I don't believe these reviews are dependent on a multi-million dollar deal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Bottom line I'll be voting against the settlement, but not because a settlement isn't warranted. To me, we're off base on the amount.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Fox. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to support this bill and I'm going to support the settlement. We can't have this kind of behavior and this kind of liability in our department, especially from folks who wear a city badge or a city seal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe. There is no dollar amount that would make Mr. Hunter whole. I think once you have that trauma, I believe it would stay with you. And. Do I support this? Yes. At the same time, I support the administration, this council on this city, making sure these kind of settlements don't come across our desk again, not because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're expensive, because we shouldn't be voting on them in the first place. There needs to be serious reform. The mayor has said it. This administration has said it. And we look forward to making sure those reforms are in place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know this has been a tough case. This has been tough for our city attorney. It's been tough for our cities. It's been tough for the sheriff's department. There are a lot of good men and women that still wear a badge in this city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we should not let this case tarnish that. And that's why I support the settlement. That's why I support moving forward on reform. Finally, we all know on city council, we've all been briefed. We are also stewards of our tax dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From what I gather, is that in the best interests of making sure our voters and making sure that as voters at the people and county people sitting in Denver who pay tax dollars know that we're smart with their resources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This could cost us a lot more. Not just socially, not just because of what's allegedly happened. Financial. Mr. President, thank you for allowing me to speak. I support this moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilman Lopez, for your comments. I concur with your comments and Councilwoman Ford, so respect where you came from. But I do want to talk tonight, even though this is a very important issue citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On behalf of Council District ten constituents, because when I came into office, we were having a great debate on the location of a future justice center and the residents under really good leadership of the Golden Triangle, even though the Justice Center and the downtown detention center would be their new neighbor, place their faith in justice in both'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the courts and in our jail system. Councilman Lopez said this had been tough on many people. I think this has really been tough on those people who put their faith in our investment in a state of the art justice center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so now I, too, am looking forward to expecting and demanding a state of the art jail operation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Robert. Councilman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. We have the city attorney and the office and the chamber this evening. And I would like to ask a basic question that the citizens in my district are asking, and it's very simple. There were deputies obviously named in the lawsuit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could you bring us up to date on what is happening or will happen to them? Thank you, Councilman Brown. Again, my name is Scott Martinez, the city attorney for Denver. I think this case put a pause button on some of the employment actions regarding those deputies in the case.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This this settlement, if it is approved tonight, would settle all claims in regards to the city as well as to those individual offers, officers and deputies. And it would allow the employment matters regarding those individual officers and deputies to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The pause button would be able to we be able to play in terms of holding those continuing those employment actions against those individual officers. And what actions are we looking at? Councilman, as you know, this is this is a personnel matter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we'll have to let those follow that normal course as those individuals have certain rights and or are our city lost? Some deputies and other incidences have been fired, though, correct? That's correct. Okay. I got to tell you, this isn't harassing for our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't understand how this could happen. Right. Just let me give you one example. In the county jail, there are currently 155 cameras. Surveillance cameras. There are proposed new cameras to be added and that will be another 184.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that total in the county jail will come to 339 cameras. Now, in the detention center, there are 678 cameras. You're being watched. Everyone's being watched. In this citizens are Denver are watching. You cannot do this. It is just incomprehensible to me that this can happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to vote for this tonight, but I hope we don't see any more. But I'm afraid we will. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Brown. Do we have any other comments from members of the council? Seen on this is for resolution 647, Madam Secretary. Oracle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But no can each layman. Lopez i nevett i Ortega abstain. Rob I Sheppard Susman i Brooks Brown, i Mr. President.'",

    "Voter Approval for Denver Preschool Program Extension and Tax Increase.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'Tonight one nay, one extension. Council Resolution 647 has been adopted. Madam Secretary, we please take the next one. What should be four bills for introduction? 574 and we add three council members call this out, Fats Brooks and Lemon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I should ask Councilwoman Fox, is this for a vote or for a comment? Vote a vote. And I council members, brooks and layman comments or votes as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Responding to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Grab that councilman Lyman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Councilman Lopez, will you please put 574.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ordered, ordered, published, please. Mr. President, move that council 547 series of 2014 be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_3': '574.'",
        "'speaker_1': '574.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. It has been moved and seconded comments from members of Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman five Thank you, Mr. President. This is an ordinance that would refer a tax increase to the voters. It concerns the preschool tax. Now, since the July 16 government and finance meeting. I expressed many of my concerns about this program and tax increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I made it clear that I'm a fan of preschool and an enthusiast about other currently existing programs through the state that target at risk children. I refer you to the committee discussion for my thoughts on a preferred solution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was July 16th. But tonight, let me acknowledge, first of all, the passion of many of my colleagues for this program. Nonetheless, here's why I'll be voting no. Number one, it is a tax increase. It raises about $4 million more a year totaling there, $20 million annually.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Number two, this proposal allows for higher administrative costs, which are already drastically understated. Stated administrative costs can go from 5 to 7% under this new proposal, but there's already another 10% in the budget amended from the legal definition that most of us would consider administrative costs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So from my perspective, I'm looking at do I want to raise administrative costs from what's in the what's in the ordinance from 5 to 7%. But I actually see it more as from 15 to 17%. Three, it extends the base program, which doesn't expire until December 2016, which is another ten years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, if this tax and this administrative increase fail, the program doesn't end. Preschool officials can bring reauthorization of the base program to people again next year. But you can go for another tax increase if they wanted to do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it doesn't end the program. What we're really voting on is higher administrative costs, higher taxes. The last concern I have is one that may be a little more subtle. But I went through this in other programs when I was at the state level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe subsidizing a program so heavily pushes the costs up. And this is one of the reasons I believe Denver has some of the highest preschool tuitions in the nation. So I am voting no on this, voting no on the tax increase, and I'm voting no for higher administrative costs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Fox, Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to bring everybody's attention to 574. This is a bill which I'm on the board of the different preschool program, and I'm bringing this initiative forward to refer it to the ballot before us tonight as an ordinance and also ballot language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is first reading, and we'll get a chance to go over this again on second reading, have a courtesy public hearing. Thank my co sponsor, Peggy Layman, as well. Wow. In 2006, Denver decided to fund the preschool program after three tries and getting it right and figuring out the right amount and how to really go after'",
        "'speaker_2': 'preschool in the city of Denver. One of the things that we've learned is this. This is not just the city of Denver issue. This is a national issue as we look at education reform. Most individuals say that you have to start with early childhood education and the data supports that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The data shows in this program that 31,816 young people, four year olds, have gone through this program. 31,816 folks who would not otherwise have if we wouldn't had this program in place. The data also shows that for those individuals that go through this program, they are kindergarten ready and they're outperforming their peers who would not be in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this program. When I say kindergarten ready, let me be specific. 89% of 2% of them are have receptive vocab. 98% are our grading proficiency in literacy and 99% in math. This is this is a program that's proving its effectiveness and readiness in in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to address a couple of reasons of of why we're looking at the increase as a board. When I first came on as a board, all we were looking at was this sunset date, this this program's sunset meaning is over in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we wanted to see the appropriate time to go to the ballot. And through going and doing a poll and going in the field and looking, we believe that this is the appropriate time. One of the things that we've been looking at for the increase is the continue or the funding for summer programing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know that there is a summer learning loss for all of our kids, but it's incredibly important that we fund that summer programing to keep that going. That's not free. You know, this also adds to the demand of full day preschool.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Most of our folks who are in who are single, single parent families or like my family, where both parents are working, don't have the opportunity just to put their kids anywhere. They want to begin having a full day programing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also, we are not just seeing an increase in preschool costs in the city of Denver. We're seeing it all throughout Colorado. And for these reasons and many more, we we believe that this is going to be a successful program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also in a state we're going from 0.012% to 0.015. That puts our sales and use tax at 3.65. That's still very competitive regionally and also nationally. And so for these reasons and many more, I hope that my colleagues will be supporting this.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Councilman Brooks did an excellent idea recitation of why this is a good program. And I'm just going to reiterate why I really think that I'm proud to co-sponsor this. It serves young children. And we know from research of very recently, even over the many years, that the better foundation you give children, the better'",

        "'speaker_5': 'They go to and we work with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those schools and we rate those schools. So not only.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Schools.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It saves money in our future when we have citizens that can get through high school and then.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'College and then jobs. They are the ones that contribute to our budgets. So I am a strong for those reasons and many that Councilwoman Brooks reiterated, I am a strong supporter of this program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Lehman. Councilman Merritt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I always resist the the the urging that government should be run like a business. But that doesn't mean that government shouldn't think like a business when we're spending the people's money and that the the expenditures we make should be thought of as investments, and investments should deliver a rate of return.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's rare that we have an opportunity to make an investment that delivers a higher rate of return than this one. The the the data is in the impact of preschool on the life chances of kids is enormous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The return on investment is not just on the order of percentages, but of multiples of the money that we put in. And the impact is particularly powerful on the most at risk kids. So not only are we improving their life chances and improving their ability to earn a good living in the future, we're also avoiding potential costs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the criminal justice system. So again, I don't want to think of government's business as a business, but think of it in a business frame of mind. We're making an investment here. This isn't this isn't about the children whom we should bring our hands about, and we need to help the children.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is an investment in the future, and you don't even have to care about kids. This is returning a serious return to the taxpayers in future earning earning potential mitigated costs in the criminal justice system. And I think I'm voting in favor of us making this excellent investment in our future.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Nevett. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm sort of reiterating what others have said, but I just want to add my $0.03. This is a $0.03 on $100. It is, as they have said, the best expense for my and your taxes that we could ask for, particularly for the investment potential for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In fact, we have a number of people who, with backgrounds in education on this council, Councilman Novick, Councilwoman Fox and myself and I think a few other teachers, Councilman Layman. So we know where of we speak about the importance of preschool education.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So important that Councilman Councilwoman Fox didn't actually mention it tonight, just asked to take a look at her meeting. I totally support what her idea was. Preschool education is so important that we might want to think about starting a dialog and a discussion to change our public education mission from K-12 to P11.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is evidence that the senior year may not be as effective and efficient, and there is conversation throughout higher education and in K-12 education about the effectiveness of the senior year. But we do know the effectiveness of the preschool year and how important it is and what an interesting idea that we might put our resources into P11'",
        "'speaker_0': 'instead of K 12. And I just had to call you let people know about your mention in committee. Councilwoman Potts. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'll be brief. I have no idea why society and. The city would not want its citizens educated from day one. That's why I'm supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez, Captain Shepard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will be supporting this tonight. And I just want to share a personal story. I have a six and a half year old son. Our family would not meet the traditional definition of an at risk family. It's a two parent earning household.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My husband holds a master's degree. My son hears well over a thousand, thousands and thousands of different vocabulary words on a daily basis at home. Yet despite that, at a very early age, my son was diagnosed with special needs and required therapy for the first several years of his life.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He was not very good, didn't have very much vocabulary. You only had one word in 18 months. He did start receiving therapy very early on, and we did participate in this Denver preschool program. When Councilman Brooks was talking about how well this prepares children for kindergarten.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can personally attest to that because my son kind of floundered in the early childhood portion of his education. But since he was able to avail himself of this program, by the time he got to kindergarten, kindergarten, he really flourished.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I just saw him blossom in the first few months, started battling like crazy, you know, and really, you know, really made tremendous, tremendous progress. And then so much so that towards the end of the first term, the teachers were saying that he had become a leader and a model for others in his classroom on various'",
        "'speaker_0': 'levels. So, you know, when we talk about the benefits of this program, I mean, it really has many benefits in many different situations. And for my son, he needed that extra special attention to get him to the place that he is today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I was so glad in the last couple of weeks because he's been writing little stories and he's very excited to go back to school now. The words are not totally correct or in order or spelled right. But I mean, I'm just, you know, for a kid that had one word at 18 months old, I just could'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I won't repeat what all of my colleagues have already stated. I just want to add that 80% of a child's brain is developed in the first three years of life. And by being able to ensure that kids have the opportunity to be exposed to a larger vocabulary and other just being able to interrelate'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with other kids when they start school, they'll be so much better off. And we know that for kids who have been in some kind of preschool program prior to starting kindergarten, they have a 15,000 word advantage. So to know that kids who have not had that are starting school at a disadvantage and by being able to refer'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this to the voters, they get to decide. But I think we have seen tremendous, tremendous benefits from this program that has been in place for as many years as it has has been here. And I just want to say a special thank you to Sue Casey, who served on this city council and was somebody who had really'",
        "'speaker_6': 'done a lot of the research and worked with many of the providers out in the community to bring this forward the first time around. And to ensure that we were successful in getting it supported and funded by the taxpayers, I think we're going to see tremendous benefits from it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my hope is that we continue to see improvements in our public education system so that that transition gets to move all the way across as they move to be graduates of our education system. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry, Mr. President, but I had to take this moment to just point out to folks who are sitting in the audience because, you know, I. I got on board with this because it's the right thing to do with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Smart for a city, but then you get inspired by some folks. And so and and Joe Heinz, the legend of early childhood education in Denver. Can you just stand up and just say hello? Yeah, yeah. And then Jerry Grimes, who is also a legend in northeast Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And all three of my kids went through Hope Center. So thank you so much, Jerry, for all your hard work for pushing.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'In a block? Yes, Mr. President. I move that both council bills 564 and five, 63, 12 and 14 be placed upon final consideration and do pass and block.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. It's been moved in, second in. And I will just start off I won't repeat a lot of what I said last week. I just feel as if this opportunity is something we shouldn't pass up on. Participation rate is something we hold.'",

Seven year contract is a very long time and we should make every opportunity to achieve that goal.

I understand that that's difficult for a council, men and women on the panel, but it is it is in compliance with the procedures that we currently have'",

For us to expect some contractors to meet that goal and not bring them to this council for not meeting that goal or not until they'",
        "'speaker_0': 'meet that goal. And to allow others who happen to be affiliated with national multi-national franchises to come forward with goals. So I really do think that that is an inconsistency that doesn't work and it's not a good message for our locally owned businesses or our independent businesses without that kind of franchise relationship.'",

And folks who were being left out of the program, folks that were being given the Thanksgiving table after Thanksgiving dinner, the child's table at Thanksgiving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And these are folks who are local businesses. These are local entrepreneurs. I don't think we should have two separate standard. Depending on where you're from, depending on who you represent, period. The rules are the rules. Just because you're a big boy doesn't mean that you can make your own rules or get an exemption.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that it should come as a no question or a surprise that there's concern about the ECB Academy program. Just fix it. Let's just get right with the program. For seven years, we've said it's problematic. For seven years, we've heard concessionaires say, hey, something's not right here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've set up plenty of tables where that's the case. Just fix it. Let's get right with the program. Does it matter who's coming to the table? Doesn't matter what job you're going to get next. You're serving the city and county of Denver, and that's what we expect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those are values that we've set. We went through a whole program about contracting and minority with minorities, women, disadvantaged businesses. Guess what? There's a disparity. We spent a whole bunch of money to find out the obvious. Let's just implement the policy and require everybody to follow those rules.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would like to vote yes on this, but I think that we need to send that message, and I think we need to stick to the plan. That's that's the will of the people of Denver. That program has value.'",

But I do have to repeat, in deference to my colleague, the AC DB program at the airport as a federal program, goals are set by the federal government, and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we are exceeding them. We are exceeding those goals. Our program is exceeding those goals. So when DIA comes to us with a contract that isn't meeting the particular goals set for that particular contract, but asserts and Debo asserts that a good faith effort was made and that continuing conversations will be made to reach that goal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a program that is exceeding the goals. I think they've earned a certain amount of trust. If that program were not exceeding the goals, I think we would be having a different conversation, I think would be entirely in the right to begin micro-managing their setting and achieving goals on particular contracts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But because the program itself is successful, I think they've earned a certain amount of latitude in making these choices. Now, when contractors come forward and they've actually exceeded the the the goal participation for ZBB, we're not wringing our hands about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's not, you know, a variation of the mean. Some will exceed. Some will fall short. But the program itself will be successful. And I think we are doing a disservice to this program that is successful by calling it into question and suggesting that because this contract isn't right on the money, that there's something profoundly wrong with the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'program. There's also one additional point I want to make, and that is that the CDB program on the federal program is very clear in that what we are to do is to set goals. If we set requirements, if we set quotas, we are in trouble.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what I'm hearing up here on this dias is we set those goals. And by God, if you don't meet those goals, you're not going to get the contract. That starts to sound like a requirement to me. And if we run that contract after contract, that becomes a quota.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't want to go down that road. If the airport were falling short, if our program were falling short, I think we would be entirely in the right to be micromanaging contract by contract. But the program is successful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's exceeding the goals set by the federal government. They've already said continuing conversations are being had to try to up the participation on this particular contract, given their performance so far. I'm confident that this will turn out well and that we will continue to have a program that exceeds our goals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I was in here last week and I apologize, but I want to try and shed a little light on this. So technology is a business in five points, and they are owned by African-Americans and they have two other joint ventures at DIA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and, you know, I want to call up Sheila as well, or your lawyer, if you want to come up and respond to a couple of questions. But they are in the process right now of developing 4 to 5 properties in the five points.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when they took on this role, they said, you know what? There's a lot going on. We've got a lot of development opportunities, so maybe we should go down to 20%. But they are not the not the prime they did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when there was an issue with that on council, they said they would go back up to 40% to to answer Councilwoman Canning's question and let me know, Vicki, if I'm wrong on this one. We are held by law.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You have to hold them to that 40% regardless, regardless of, you know, what we say in here and what we believe. But you're you have to hold them to that 40%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually, it's like Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Never.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good faith effort to meet the goal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we in essence, they are held to 40% by showing us what participation they have and how the rest of it garnered a good.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Faith effort, how that's justified. They have to provide extensive documentation for the remaining percentage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of the goal. They're getting the 20%.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'But first of all, I want to say I'm Sheila King, civil technology. This is Ronald Gomez. Ron Gomez with host HMS Host. All right. So can I turn it over to Ron?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. We can hear from him, but I want to hear from you, too. I want to hear from civil technologies as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But can you state the question again?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I just that the 20% goal that that was that you originally went down to. Mm hmm. Why did you feel like you had to go down 20%? And why now are you at 40? And do you feel comfortable with that 40% goal that you will meet that goal?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I will we iterate what you said. We're doing a lot of development in the neighborhood. We are using the whole experience to to do the restaurants, things like that in the neighborhood. I also feel that the 40% I've been hearing from everybody, 40% is what it should be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was set. And so I'm just trying to say, let's do it. Let's just do what needs to be done and move forward. So, yes, to answer your question. Yes, I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can I. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. I'm just a vice president host. I'm not a lawyer by any stretch. Okay. That would be an apology to all lawyers. Oh. I oversee the national program for host. Our program has 115 partners like Sheila King.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It generates a $350 million a year. I'm not the reigning expert on the DB program, but I'm getting close to the dangerous water you tread in when you set a goal and just achieve the goal at all costs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Someone use the word quota. That's kind of a dirty word. But you do invite you invite criticism from the federal government when you do these joint ventures, they have to comply not just in an equity investment. It's not just profit and loss.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's management control. There's decisions. There's control over the contract that have to be shared in proportion to the ownership. We have joint ventures all over the country. We have joint ventures with 40% participation. We have joint ventures with 45% participation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's achievable. There are instances where it's difficult. The city of Denver, the Small Business Office, watches the program very closely. I commend them for that. We have submitted joint venture proposals at much lower levels and they've rejected it because you can't get to the management control that the federal regulations mandate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This isn't self-serving. There are people that want to blow this program up. There's a group called the Pacific Legal Foundation who is looking for airports that are overstepping the intent of the law so they can bring suit. They've done it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're out there and they're watching. So SBO is to be commended for being the guardian of the program, how the 40% goal was set, I don't know. It's a difficult goal to achieve on to kiosk and coffee shops.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If it was a gigantic casual dining restaurant and you could split responsibilities front of house, back of house. There's ways you could do it. It's very difficult to do a compliant joint venture that will not invite criticism from federal auditors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in good faith, we looked at that as well as civil tech's financial situation at the time. We want to partner with them because there are that they don't they're not just in it to make a buck. They're trying to learn the redeveloping and underdeveloped neighborhood in the city and they're going to bring it back to life'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And they needed the expertize that we could bring to them. And we're teaching them the business. We're teaching them how bartending works, how restaurants work, how coffee shops work, how the employees behave when you're not watching. These are all things that they hadn't learned yet in their careers, and we're very proud of the program we've put together'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at Host because we do better. We can and we will. In this instance, the 40% appropriately put together was difficult to hit. We can get to it, but it's going to take a little bit of time. And if that's the mandate of the council, will, of course, do it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But just understand be careful what you invite when you go down these paths.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll try not to repeat everything I said last week, but what I would like to know is how do you plan to meet that 40% goal? We were told last week that perhaps with suppliers we would attempt to see the 20% increase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd like to know how, because I'm not sure that that gets us there because your purchases will vary from month to month. And I've been told by operators of airports as well as concessionaires that in order to meet goals with suppliers, we need to have close to 100% of the suppliers for any of the concessions where'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we're going to allow that flexibility for them to meet goals with suppliers. So I'd like to hear how you plan to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. 40% via supply chain is impossible. It's flat out impossible that in a food and beverage environment, in a food and beverage environment, your goods and services are probably about 25, maybe 30% of your contract. If you went to 100%, you couldn't get there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This would be achieved through equity ownership and management participation. As civil tech brings a manager into the business and the manager gets up to speed and can be given a broader range of responsibilities. It would be that route that we would take to get to the 40%, but it would be through equity ownership and managed and cooperative'",
        "'speaker_1': 'management of the facility goods and services in a tightly controlled brand like a Starbucks where you buy the beans, the cups, the napkins, everything comes from from them. It's it's it's really a difficult. Can you achieve some? Sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you're talking fractions of a percent, maybe one or 2%. It has to come through equity, ownership and participation. And we're prepared to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in equity ownership and participation is with this particular partner that you have or are you looking to bring in other partners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Know their economic situation has has improved their projects moving forward and getting funded their street side project is getting funded so they have the ability to raise the funds to participate on the equity side. So we're perfectly content to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But to try to have three people running one operation, I mean, that's imagine trying to run your household that way. It's it's very it's difficult enough with a mother and father arguing. And if you brought in a third party, it would be tough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's you have to have a rational business model. We're all in this to serve the customer, but we're all in this, too, to to run a good, profitable operation. And too many chiefs would spoil the coffee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just want to add, thank you for your comments that you've actually made. The case that I've been raising about why suppliers is not the way to go in trying to meet goals on these projects. I know that we have had other concessionaires who have come through and when they are awarded a bid and I know'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this is a little different because it's under the premium value program, but when the goals are set, they should be applied across the board consistently, whether it's a new bid or it's a renewal of a current contract under the PVC program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But those folks who go through the bid process are told that they have to commit to meet that goal, and that's very clearly stated to them. So, you know, their understanding is if we don't meet this goal, we don't get this contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and generally they're not brought forward until those goals are met. So this sort of gets back to the question that Councilwoman Kimmich asked. Why why not continue the conversation to ensure that goals are met? And I heard you loud and clear about the fact that there are people out there, there have been people out there trying'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to undermine any goal program that cities have had. We've had the city has been sued on occasions in the past, which has changed the laws and the rules of how these programs operate. But I think if we're setting the rules for one group, they need to be consistently applied because we can't change them as we go along'",
        "'speaker_6': '. It creates too much of an unlevel playing field for those who are complying with every single tee that's been crossed and I that's been dotted on the contracts that they've signed. And when it appears as though we're allowing a different standard for corporate franchises who want to be in our airport, that doesn't feel right for the local'",
        "'speaker_6': 'people who are also having to put out huge capital investment for, you know, rebranding the space and all of that. And so I'm not comfortable moving this forward tonight, and I don't hear that there's a desire or an interest to hold it up to allow this to be worked out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I don't know where the votes are on it, but that's where I'm at. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Okay, Councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I defer to my colleague, Councilman Lopez, who is a believer ahead of me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, in a way. I didn't mean to speak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your name is not on the comic at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, it's on my screen, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I did not have it on my iPod.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great company. Thanks. I apologize for thinking out loud during this debate, but that's what I'm doing. Because every time I hear something, I'm learning and I'm processing. But I think that one thing I want to be really clear about is I have no interest in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Causing a situation that might lose this partnership. One of the things I don't want is only large TVs that are really easy to walk in with a ton of capital to be able to do these kinds of partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, you know, the fact what I don't want to do is reject this concession contract and and then have this, you know, concessionaire say, well, let's just find someone who can walk in and easily do 40% and then lose an opportunity for a company that is just getting started and really does have a great reputation in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the Five Points community and deserves this opportunity. So it's really difficult to try to anticipate what the unintended consequences might be of actions that we might take here on the dais tonight. I guess I, I kind of asked about it, but let me be even more pointed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, as a council member in this body, I could make a motion to delay this vote until a date certain. And with the vote of my colleagues, that could occur if if we had their support. Is it the desire of the civil technologies?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would additional time be meaningful in changing this conversation, I guess is the question. And and that will I guess I would like to know from you whether or not three weeks additional time might change the conversation in terms of the commitment versus the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to try to start here and get there. Thank you for the consideration. I think at this particular moment, I've had a lot of discussion and a lot of time to think about it. I'd like to go on and go with the 40% and we will work it out with host and how it all works out'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and and move forward. Yeah. Let me ask the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The office of DSP. So what what needs to happen if they were to make this decision, if the parties were to get to this decision, how does it become official in terms of what the airport reports to us?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So today they've said to us the commitment is 20% and X, Y, Z. So what has to happen for the airport to be able to say to us, well, the commitment is now 40. What are the processes or procedures.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we would need to see? Chris Martinez The Business Small Business Opportunity Office. Councilman Kenny Councilwoman Kenny's. What we would need to see is a new joint venture and how that 40% is being made up, where the capital is coming from and what will be the management or whatever types of agreement participation they will have in that'",
        "'speaker_1': '40%. We will have to see all that in a joint venture, a legal write up before we can have. We would have to review it and then make a decision to either to approve or not approve. As Mr. Gonzales said earlier, we have just approved some before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we need to see of the the whole joint venture in its entirety to make that case for it. That's what we did on the 20%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. If you'll indulge me one more question, please, which is host the representative from host, if you would like to respond without deciding now on the floor of a public meeting what you will or won't do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How much time would you need to be able to enter such an agreement as has been described? If if you were to go that route, what would be the time to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Within a three week window we can redraft a joint venture agreement. We've already talked with civil tech today and over the weekend, and we've moved this as fast as we can. What I wouldn't do is stand in front of you and say, I can do something that we can't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Within three weeks, we can certainly have the joint venture redrafted and submitted to the SBA for approval. And as long as I don't want to speak for Miss Padilla or Mr. Martinez, but as long as they can take a look at it fairly quickly and get back to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, I think we can certainly have this done in that three week window and have that in front of you and get to our 40% joint venture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. With that in mind, I'm just I it's up to you, Mr. President. I'm ready to make a motion to delay consideration of this item to the date certain of August 25th. But I see we have other colleagues who have chimed in to speak, and so I can hold that motion, if you prefer that I do so'",
        "'speaker_0': ', or I can make it now and second it. But then the discussion would be on the motions. Point of order.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right? Councilwoman Kennedy I and Kevin Moran, I to our attorneys were saying their hands. I want to get I believe that the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion has already been made in segment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you're looking to change something, you'd have to have a substitute motion and with an agreement by the second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Correct. So if there was a motion to postpone, there would need to be a move and a second. And I was going to first ask if Councilwoman Robb wanted to make her comments and. Before we got to that, unless Councilman Kenny said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have I believe Councilman Robert also has a relevant point of order to my motion. So, yes, I just wanted to point out that 30 day review period ends on 18 and eight, 25 is a week after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think it would require that this bill be killed and there be a substitute in. But someone needs to speak to that because I'm not an attorney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe there's a holdover provision in the agreement, so I don't think we have to kill it at this point in time. But that's why we have to go back and look at the at the provision just to double check that one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Write to me on the question council mirror. I will go to Councilman Ortega and then we'll we'll.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I have two questions. The first one is for Delia. What does this do to this space? Are both of these currently Starbucks locations? So it doesn't really change anything right now if we delay the schedule.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You are correct, Councilman Ortega? That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And basically, this would have to be a new a new contract to be filed anyway. So if council voted it down tonight, you would be bringing back a whole new agreement with the 40%. Correct. And if we could do that within that three week time frame, that may be the better way to go.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Otherwise, what we're doing is just delaying this. That would be replaced with another bill anyway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. Councilman or Councilman Ortega, just to verify your comment. I believe what will happen is we will have to read to look at the new joint venture present to present it to us at a 40% verify that if it was acceptable and then we would change the goal or the contract would then be written up with a'",
        "'speaker_1': '40% participation goal rather than a new contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be a new contract brought to council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know the disease process. I just know what our process that would be is to with what.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Changes what we're approving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. But in the contract you're approving today with the 20% goal does not preclude us from increasing the goal. Should we come up with the new joint venture agreement and a new level of participation? We can always increase that participation from them and and count it towards their goal as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the goal is at 20%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we're being asked to approve is 20%. If we want 40%, then you should file a new ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. We're going to we're going to make sure we get everyone's questions out. And then I saw the attorneys huddling. So maybe they'll have an answer about the 30 day window. And I'll come back to that. But let's first go through council members Nevett and then fourth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if there are any more questions, we'll address the the idea for a possible motion Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I as you know, I hate cutting off debate, so I'm just going to continue putting myself at the bottom of the list. But once everyone has had their say, I want to call the question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't I don't understand. I mean, we have we have a prime concessionaire who has clearly indicated an eagerness to work with a new ECD concessionaire and expand their role in the business. We have an airport whose program is exceeding the goals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have an Office of Small Business Opportunity that's clearly committed to upping active participation. I'm left scratching my head why we would not approve this contract to move forward in the full knowledge that everybody is pulling on the same rope in the same direction to increase the ECD participation in this joint venture.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just going to keep putting myself at the bottom of the list once everyone's had their say. I'm going to call the question. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you're not right now, Councilman Nevitt?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think Councilman Merritt just said things beautifully. I just have one question, though, along that line for our department, Chris, maybe you're the person. Is this the first time that a contract has been rewritten with the goals?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, are we are we encountering something that has never, ever happened before?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if I if I believe your your question is, is this the first time that if it was rejected and a new contract is written with the new go?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is it after the contract is signed and then we raise the goal?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. I mean, we have a contract in front of us that was agreed to by everybody and seemed to be okay. And then we had questions on the floor, which is going to be asking us to essentially redo a business agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm just trying to is this the only company that has ever had difficulty in reaching its original goals so that they were adjusted in a contract?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To my knowledge, I believe is the only one like that. The way you're describing it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So this this really is the first time this has ever happened. This is ground setting precedent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that is correct, to my knowledge. We have had contracts come before us, before council, before approved. And then we were we had the goal increased over time after the fact. I mean, at the gold participation I'm sorry, participation increased after the fact, but this isn't now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It? If, for instance, as and when we have concessionaires out there today and an opportunity arises where they could bring in more participation, they can bring in more participation, and we will we verify that participation and we will count that towards the participation for that particular concept that has happened in the past.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I'm not asking my question. Well, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think what you're asking is, has there ever been an instance where a goal was set and the concessionaire couldn't make it? Yeah. Yes. And the contract went forward. Is that is that your question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, never, ever been one. I mean, this one has been rewritten to adjust to those realities. I'm gathering and I'm just wondering, is I mean, is this the first time in the whole world that's ever happened?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I just ask a clarifying question? I know you're back then, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Ortega, let's let's see if they do have an answer from Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me see if I can do this other way. Conferring with the Wikipedia on this has been in with the CDB program since its inception at the IAEA. We have had contracts come before council and approved and then after they began their work, we have been able to increase participation and not have to redo the contract because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they are meeting their current goal. At the same time, we have had contracts come before council with they go and the goal not achieved or not being met at the time presented to council. But they completed the good faith effort which by law the federal rules say if they complete the modified good faith, the good faith effort'",
        "'speaker_1': ', we cannot deny them the contract based solely on them not achieving the goal. If they accomplish and met the good faith effort standards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. That's really I think that's my unease about all this. I seem to feel that we're going down a road that is very uncomfortable to me, and I would very much like to just go ahead and let them work with the good faith.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's very rare that I ever agree with anything the federal government says, but gee, they're happy. Why can't we be?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Fox. Councilman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I would say to my colleagues, if you don't like the federal law and then run for Congress and change it. I like the federal law in this case, which is pretty damn rare, but I do in this case.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sheila Right. Sheila, when you were standing there at the podium, you probably don't know it, but you look me in the eye and I believe what you say. That's all I need. I'm ready to vote on this. And don't forget, we have an obligation not just to serve the city and county of Denver, but to me, more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'importantly, to serve the 50 million people who come through that airport every year and they want your product. I wish we had ten more Starbucks out there. The two combined bring in a half a million dollars a year to take half a million dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need more, not less. We need to pass this contract tonight. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Brown. We are back to Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I just I wanted to make sure that we got this clear. You know, we talked about the three week delay, and everyone said they could do it. But the the the the entity that we are trying to increase, the entity that we are trying to to empower said we're ready to do it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just wanted to make that clear that this business is ready to do it tonight. And so and I'd hope that that we can move forward with this. There are obviously some issues and I don't think it's with a be a CBD program, but I think it's premium value.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that's another whole nother conversation. There's some bigger issues that we need to start looking at as a council, and I don't think we need to hold small businesses who have a track record of over 20 years in the Five Points and throughout Denver and then the nation accountable for what's a larger problem and reality.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks, before we go to councilman now, but I will just chime in real quickly and I appreciate the colleagues robust dialog on this. And I'm a huge fan of civil technologies. I know that I met with them last week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I met with them today. And I have got to meet the house today and I support what they do as well, which is I just find of of very interest that the companies that say they struggle to meet our requirements are the larger companies with huge, large economies of scale and the ability to connect with different entities'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that smaller businesses can't do that. And when I hear that is a challenge, I just I just find that very hard to digest when we have those requirements to smaller organizations, and yet they are able to achieve those results.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So by me voting against this contract in no way means that I am against civil technology. I know the great work that they do. I'm a huge fan of those, but I just believe that in order to achieve those goals that the AI continues to set and be very successful, we need to have the scrutiny and if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we continue to make those exceptions every time it becomes the norm because it's just a goal then. So it's not something that I have to achieve. It should be hard, but the reward from achieving those goals benefits everyone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And though I certainly hope that we can find a way to do that, and that is the reason that I will be voting against that. So I believe, Councilman Nevett, you were the last person to chime in, but it may not be any other question, so it might be time to vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if you want to, councilman, never. Do you have anything to add?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was going to call the question, but if it's unnecessary, we can just proceed to the vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, it looks like we have no other questions or comments from members of council. So this is Catwoman Sheppard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm a little confused. There's been discussion about a motion to extend to a date certain. What happened to that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman? Those were discussions. No motions were put out. So currently we have 563 and 564 on final consideration and do pass for a block.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So but I thought I understood Councilwoman Keech saying that she would let the conversation continue and then revisit that. Is that what I understood or am I am I not hearing? Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will let. Councilwoman, can you speak?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Sheppard, my my colleague, Councilwoman Robb, in her wisdom and experience notice that dates of the the 30 day period expiring before the date that I was going to postpone this to that according to the charter gives the administration some authority to move forward with things without our actions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So unfortunately I don't think my my motion would make a lot of sense or would work in the way that I intended. So that's why I didn't make it because just again, consulting with some of the procedural motions and little date limitations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm prepared to vote. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Do we have any other questions or comments? I can open that you're still on there. But did you? You were good. Okay, just remind everyone, this is 563 and 564 on a block for final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Brooks Brown. Hi, Fats. I can eat. Lemon. Hi, Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Levitt. Hi, Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rob Shepherd? No. Sussman. I can eat. No. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. Councilwoman Ortega, you're voting five. Sorry. Manchester. Manchester, close to voting, announced the results of two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By just checking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seven eyes, five knees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Geminis and five May five, 63 and 564. You are placed upon final consideration and you pass. Well, those were the last ones that are called out. So we are now ready for the block votes. All other bills for introduction are ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Lopez, will you please put the resolutions on the floor for adoption?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Mr. President, I move that council resolution. Oh, wait a second. Yeah. Council resolution 584602603 585 591 and 601 to be adopted. Also, 2014.'"
