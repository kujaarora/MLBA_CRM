        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Madam President. Before I do, I'm just very moved and gut punched by that presentation. And I could I ask just for 30 seconds of silence before we move on to a proclamation that has a much different tone?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's only appropriate. I'd like to ask that, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you. I wasn't actually counting. I was actually thinking of that horrific day. I appreciate your indulgence. Yeah, thanks. Proclamation 20 Dash 848 honoring Allen Dulles for his 33 years of service to the city and county of Denver.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And. Whereas, Allen is an accomplished professional and a collaborative team member, an established leader who invested and supported the career development of many others.

        "'speaker_2': 'It's been moved and seconded. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I'll just be really brief, having known Allen for I guess since he started with the city. I know Councilwoman Ortega will remember that the city council used to run the cable television franchise and the Premier and the Channel eight came under city council back in the day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Alan came in as a as a young'un. I don't. What color was his beard? Maybe he'll tell us what color his beard was at the time. But every viewer of Denver TV, Denver ATV will recognize Alan. And I believe they will miss him.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They will miss his summaries. They will miss his introductions. Don't miss his programing, the misses marketing. And I think we will miss him. As much as that, if not more, because we've come to rely on Denver eight under his leadership and his guidance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that as the proclamation said, the folks that he nurtured into leadership and mentored will carry the ball forward and keep us going into the future, whatever telecom may bring with that, Madam President, and if any other members want to say anything, that'd be welcome.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I'd like to ask that my name be added to the proclamation. I've known Ellen for quite some time, and as a matter of fact, he and I had been talking about doing the proclamation that I realized that Councilman Flynn was working on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I actually asked them if they would put together from Channel eight a synopsis of the last, I think next year, a 35 year anniversary that Channel eight will have been in existence. So do you just kind of a snapshot and to try to tie that into one of our imagined 20, 20 nights so that you can capture'",
        "'speaker_5': 'highlights that have existed over that time. I mean, how many, you know, mayors have served during that time, some of the milestone things that have occurred within our city. So when the franchise agreement originally came into place, it was it was under Mile High cable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want the Davis was actually one of the investors in the whole thing. And he was a councilman. And he had to divest from from being able to participate. But a lot of changes took place. We now have two franchise companies, Comcast and CenturyLink and Channel airs on both of those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So people get to watch our city affairs on both of those companies so that people are up to speed on on what's going on within the city. Alan has done an amazing job in shaping the team of people that make up the staff at Channel eight and have just taken the organization to tremendous levels, have received numerous'",

        "'speaker_5': 'that the public gets to know what's going on within city government. You know, the fact that people can pull up archives, council meetings, you know, all of that kind of stuff to just share with them the incredible work that happens within our city on a day in and day out basis.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, I just wanted to add my congratulations and my thanks. I remember just over five years ago, the first time I met Alan when I was terrified out of my mind. Facing a debate with eight opponents running for the District seven seat at Cameron Church.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there were all kinds of fancy cameras and all kinds of people in the audience. And I remember meeting Alan. He said some very nice things to me that helped, I think, keep me from passing out on Channel Eight at the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'll take that with me. That and all of the other little moments that came here and there most of the time in what we do generally is behind the wall. But every once in a while, there will be events that they're not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's always so fun to see everyone doing their work. And what you've done for our city through Channel eight and for transparency of government is really unparalleled. And you will be you will be missed. And we appreciate you, but congratulations as you are moving into retirement.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, thank you, Madam President. I won't repeat what the proclamation of my colleagues have said. I just want to thank Alan so much. You're a consummate professional. You've created a true community asset with Channel eight and letting people be aware of what's going on with our city government.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, we do. Americans in Cozumel and Ortega remember this? The council committees used to meet in 455 and Councilman Clark, the cameras were in that little room with packed with like 30 people at a time. And so it was most unpleasant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alan probably remembers that. But I would like to bring up Alan Dulles, who actually reminds me of last week. Looks like it could be Peck, Kennedy's younger brother. Helen, help us out here. Okay. Well, I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The effort that went into making this proclamation and the time spent doing it. And I really appreciate all of you, because one of the things that has been so important to me is the fact that. It's really important for the residents of our city to know how accessible everyone is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Each council member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is just like your neighbor.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just appreciate the time that I've.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Spent and the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That I've been able to work with Denver eight. And as you can see, I'm much different when I have to appear on camera as in a professional role than just speaking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kevin's point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'About the color.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It was great fun and it just was one of those times that I was able to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Spend. And I remember sitting around the table with Kevin Flynn, sort of not not too closely, because we wanted to keep that separation of of press and government different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But having good times there. And. And Mr. Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of course.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where.'",

Excuse me. And considering we are just wrapping up the DPA contract, I want to be particularly cautious because I believe so.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. And thank you, Councilman Haines. The way that this works is that the panel of five is presented to the parties in a dispute that could be the sheriff's office or the police department. And then each party strikes a name until they get down to one name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the panel does not sit like a panel in the appeals court where they all hear the case. It is a process of elimination until one is selected. And so we made the decision last year that we felt like three was probably not robust enough and decided to go with five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had we must have at least three, but we chose to go up to five to include some more diversity of experience and backgrounds. And then this would be only this individual and it would only be one individual who would be retained if this process were needed is retained by that process.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I think you are the arbitrators, but the cop. Well, I guess the one arbitrator who was selected. Is that person compensated?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, they are. And, you know, fees are in an inner range per hour, plus travel. This is a pretty specialized area of labor law. And we do not have very robust public sector unions in the state of Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we look to ensure that we have a balance where we could find individuals with local experience in the West or the state of Colorado, but also folks who would have public sector arbitration experience and also where possible, public safety experience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those were some of the factors that we look to, to recruit. And I just want to acknowledge I mentioned them specifically, but this was Councilwoman Black, Councilwoman Zeta Baca. As your boards and commissions subcommittee of the council that did this process along with Emily Lapel doing all the hard work for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yep. And thank you for your hard work. I notice that none of them are in Denver and to or from the East Coast, like not even in Colorado. Is that was that on purpose or can you help me understand?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Again, you will find the most qualified labor lawyers and the most qualified labor arbitrators in markets with more strength in larger public sector unions. We don't have a lot of public sector unions in the state of Colorado, which means we have fewer people practicing in this area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Generally speaking, arbitrators come from careers of backgrounds in this specialized area of law, maybe either working for management or unions, and then they graduate into arbitration. So it tends to be those who are later in their careers. We did a very robust recruitment looking in the state of Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you can imagine, you also can't have anyone who has any conflicts of interest, right? So anyone who's represented the city or represented our unions would not be a good candidate for this position. So Emily can answer, but because we don't have a very robust labor protections in the West here, there are fewer people who practice in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this area. So we aired on the side of doing a heavy recruitment for both experience as well as geographic trying to get folks who may be in the vicinity. And so but but we again, we just don't have a large pool of these people in the state of Colorado because there are not that many public sector unions'",
        "'speaker_0': 'here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's a really good point about the conflict of interest and how probably anyone who practiced in this field in Denver is probably conflicted. So. Okay, I don't have any other questions. Thank you. For the additional context. I just wanted to make sure that it just seemed little.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That timing seemed a little interesting. So that's why I figured I'd ask that. Thank you for your help. And thank you for to the to the committee, to the panel, for for your hard work. No other questions. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to add a few things. We actually discussed this at last October's financing governance meeting. And it's this small group that Councilwoman CdeBaca and councilmen, Councilwoman and I are on. It is quite a lot of work, and we've been working very hard to get people appointed to boards and commissions, and this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'one just took a little bit longer. So that's the reason why it's coming to you now is see, the fact that it is at the same time as we're having other discussion is purely coincidental. And I also wanted to add and add that we were looking for some more diversity among the arbitrators.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that was one of the things that we were looking at. And lastly, for those of you who maybe didn't see the email, Emily Lapel sent a very detailed email last Monday with all of their resumes and a little description of the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you have further questions, you can look there or feel free to ask any of us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Looks like we're good on that one. Next item up is Council Bill 759. Councilmember Hines, go ahead with your questions on Council Bill 759, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this, I think, is related to another conversation that we'll have later tonight, and it's certainly related to the movement that we have nationally and internationally. I see that this contract appears to be. It's about mental health and substance abuse assistance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. Oh, so substance abuse and mental health assistance in our jail. And, um, and I want to. I guess I'm curious about this and not necessarily concerned, but but it seems like if we're authorizing more money for addiction and mental health treatment ennerdale, we are further intertwining those two instead of separating.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, you know, our our sheriff's deputies. But that isn't really their wheelhouse because they're trying to be sheriff's deputies on addiction or social worker mental health counselors. I'm just trying to get some more context about this. This particular contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wonderful. We've got Kerry Stanley here to answer your questions. Go ahead, Kerry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. And thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all tonight. I absolutely understand the curiosity around continuing to enhance our services inside of the jail. We are subcontracting the substance use disorder treatment with the empowerment program and the mile high behavioral health care agency in order to ensure that we are providing these services with licensed'",
        "'speaker_0': 'counselors. So while the uniform part of the sheriff's department is absolutely critical for us continuing to do our work surrounding mental health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And substance use addiction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Counseling, it's really to provide that security and operations of the jail. So as the director of inmate programs, my team, as well as all of our subcontractors, are ensuring that we have the expertize and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The education and the licensure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To continue to provide those services. And I will say in regards to continuing to intertwine the services with people in the jail, I certainly have concern for those people that are in custody to make sure that their need to be met while they're here, even if that's on a short term basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of these programs, the device program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Recovery in a school environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Both male and female units requires only a 30 day stay. If somebody isn't staying with us that long, we have substance use education classes. If somebody is interested, we have plans. We have interactive journal programs. We have individual counseling.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We really want to try to meet people where they're at in regards to their services and what they need. And sometimes when they come into our care and custody, they're ready to have those conversations. And we want to make sure that we're here to meet them and meet that need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, but I guess we can't revolutionize the world overnight. Yeah, but. But I would. I would love for us to provide that funding or addiction and mental health funding to divert someone entirely from. From incarceration so that we can treat before we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Earlier in the process. Then after they're incarcerated. And. But. But I suppose we are where we are today. So. So I will continue to push for additional funding and moving our money to up the. I don't know what the right phrase is up the supply chain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's not really a good phrase, but closer to the source as opposed to I just really I don't want our sheriff's deputies to be set up for failure when they're having to be around a population. They just don't have training to be around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they weren't meant to provide addiction and mental health treatment. So that's that's all I have. Thank you. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to add that Councilman Cashman, Councilwoman CdeBaca and I serve on the Crime Prevention and Control Commission. This was a body that was created after it was actually a result of the the vote that went before the people to create the funding for the justice center that's downtown.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And after the first try, when they when the city tried to put it down at 625, there was a lot of conversation among the community about making sure that we had programs and resources that were focused on preventing people from being in the jail system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so the body that we serve on has resources that is providing programs that works toward keeping people out of the jail. And so I wanted you, Councilman Hines, because sometimes history matters for folks to know and understand, you know, sort of where those resources came from, that the PCC has the ability to delve out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of that is administered within various city agencies, including our our DA's office. But it's all focused on trying to reduce jail bed time for people in the jail system and figuring out which are programs like our reentry program, for example, is one of those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as you know, we've we have voted on that contract where that program is across the street in the same building that our post office is in, and that's providing services to people who come out of the jail system, making sure that they have access to being able to do the resume again, accessing other resources, for example'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So we wanted folks to to just know that so that they're there. There are ongoing efforts and programs that are are doing some of this very work that you're talking about. So thank you. I just wanted to make sure folks were aware of that.'"

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, Madam President. I move. That counts. 836 be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It has been moved. And can I get a second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council member say the baka your motion to amend.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The spill. There was some confusion about potential conflicts with another bill that we sent to the ballot. And I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew we were. These are designed to work together. They're not designed to conflict with each other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so there is a section in, I believe it's sea for where there are 30 days identified between the time of a vacation of the city attorney, city attorney seat and the task of nominating a minimum of three individuals to the mayor for appointment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like to amend that to be within a reasonable time to pair with Councilwoman Sawyer's bill that we got on the ballot. And there are that one sentence later. There's also a point where that 30 day time frame is alluded to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd like to also change that to within a reasonable time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. Q Councilwoman, do you have the exact language that we need read into the record if you want to go ahead and read that in? That would be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. It is under C one and second sentence. This list, the list shall be submitted within a reasonable time after the removal, death, retirement, tender, or resignation of the city attorney. If the Mayor shall fail to make appointment from such list within the 15 days from from the time it is submitted to the Mayor, the appointment shall'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be made by the City Council from the same list within the next 15 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. I want to check with our council secretary. That's not exactly what I'm seeing up on the Strip. So I just want to make sure that we're at the right place.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. I think I did my comments first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, okay. We got we got that. So the purpose of the amendment is to eliminate the rigid deadline and allow for future flexibility by submitting potential nominees to the mayor. Councilman Sawyer, you're up for a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks. I just wanted to check with the city attorney's office regarding the phrasing of the council approval of mayoral appointees. Bill says, I can't remember the exact wording, but I believe it is appointed by and nominated and appointed by the mayor and approved by council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to double check with the city attorney's office that that that this doesn't. Can you just can we just talk really quickly about the dovetailing of these two to ensure how that works together? They might be getting upgraded.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'There you go. There is no video either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just practiced all this so I would be ready to go. So we do not believe that there would be a direct conflict between these two bills. I was pointing out initially that we are on the amendment still not the bill itself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So but just to expedite, just to say, because this nomination commission creates a list of nominees for the mayor to choose from, and then the mayor of Portland nominates and appoints from that list that there is not a direct conflict between these two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And John, can you just really quickly on this amendment, this then clears up any conflict that there is between the two that initially proposed wording and the wording for the for what has already been referred on the council approval of mayoral appointees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, absolutely. And so the bill that was passed by city council regarding council appointments or council consent to appointments uses this reasonable time frame. So this also matches that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, okay, so we can talk about the whole bill later. But I just wanted to reconfirm on that one right now for the. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. See no other questions from council members. Madam Secretary, roll call on the amendment for 836, please.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I don't believe the amendment fixes the ultimate conflict here. The sponsor of this had agreed to the council approval of the mayoral appointments, and that should have settled the matter. What this does is it introduces, frankly, a rather goofy and ill advised process for selecting the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It puts it in the hands of people outside the city family. When I go to select a lawyer for my personal interests, or when the city selects a lawyer to represent its corporate interests there, it's there's no reason to go to an outside group to say, who should we hire?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This should be a choice of the counsel, the administration, the auditor and the clerk, the independent agencies that are represented by the city attorney who is now selected only by the mayor. If were I to craft an amendment to the charter that would solve this problem, I think that Councilwoman Ortega will I will agree with this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We should have an amendment in the charter that permits the city council to hire its own separate legal counsel, separate from the city attorney's office. The second level of of approaching this issue should be that when the mayor selects the city attorney candidate for that the cabinet, that that position would be selected by a committee, a screening'",
        "'speaker_4': 'committee that consists of the mayor. The President of Council with the advice and consent and consultation of the body, the auditor and the clerk. But farming this out to an outside committee of just anybody is frankly goofy and ill advised.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and the final problem with this, of course, is that this had been scheduled for committee twice. It should have been hashed out in committee. But the sponsor pulled it from the agenda and it had never been discussed in committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And here we are making sausage at the last minute. This is not how we amend the charter. There is no urgency to this. The city attorney right now, as far as we know, isn't going anywhere for two years perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is something that can be more intentionally planned and discussed over the next year. There's a ballot next year that this could go on. And frankly, I would push to have the city council, the auditor and the mayor join in the selection of the city attorney and have a stake in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or, as Councilwoman Ortega has talked about for years, have the city council with its own with its own attorney and council. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. We've got Councilman Herndon up next and then I see other hands raised in the queue. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Herndon impressing with the members who signed up to speak. I would refer to him. I'll be voting no on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. This was discussed at the December nine Charter Review Committee, and I went back and watched the committee. And I was very intrigued by the idea of the council being involved in selecting the city attorney, because we are the clients of the city attorney and I still really like that idea and I'd like to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'spend some more time talking about it and thinking about it. Unfortunately, we do have a process and we set up the Charter Review Committee and the next step was to come to finance and governance. This was scheduled for July 21st and then was canceled.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I really believe that amending the charter is a pretty weighty matter and we should follow the process. We should fully understand items before we send them on to the voters. I feel like we owe it to our constituents and to the general public that we follow the process and make sure we've gotten an analysis and we've'",
        "'speaker_0': 'gotten feedback from the community. So I'm not going to be supporting it tonight, but I'm very open to future discussions about this. And I agree with what Councilman Flynn said, that we're probably not going to have a vacancy in this job any time soon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that that'll give us the time we need to have a more thorough discussion of it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. I think based on the fact that I was the one who referred the council approval of mayoral appointees Bill and did all of the research on it, I am the most supportive person of this, you know, of any council member out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I think 100% that this is something we need to discuss further. And when I did the research for the Appointments Bill, I know that there are other strong mayors, cities out there who have a nominating committees for a number of other positions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know the specifics of those because I wasn't doing the research on specifically on the nominating commission. So I would but I would like to know more. And I think those are the kinds of questions that I have that I would have asked had this gone to committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like to know what has worked in other cities? Why? Who sits on those boards? Why those people sit on those boards? What other what unintended consequences have come because of the people who sit on those boards?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What best practices have other cities who use nominating commissions, you know, have come? Why? You know, there I have a lot of questions that I think need to be answered when we are talking about changing the charter of the city and county of Denver, the single most important governing document we have in our city, we can't do'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it lightly. And even though we want immediate action and I mean, I get it because I am a an imperfect action is always better than perfect inaction person myself. That is a mantra I live by. I think that sometimes, as frustrating as it might be and as desperately as we might want to move quickly, it is better'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to slow down and be more thoughtful about how we approach this. And this is one of those situations because we don't want to change the charter of the city and county of Denver lately. And I see that having spent hundreds of hours on research and conversation with my mayoral appointments, charter referral and and when we got to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the end of that process, it went through on consent because even the, the, the council members who are not going to sit down and vote for it on their own ballots at the end of the day agreed that that enough conversation and enough research had been done, that the people of the city of Denver deserved to sit'",
        "'speaker_0': 'down and be able to vote on it because it was researched enough and had had enough conversation and enough questions and had gone through the process. So I think as much as I do support this and as much as I do believe that there is a conversation that needs to happen here, the conversation hasn't been had yet'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and so it needs to be had. And so I will not be supporting this tonight, but I absolutely support this moving forward. And I look forward to having this conversation and hearing about research as it is done and and referring this to another ballot, because the people deserve to vote on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and so I look forward to doing this work. But tonight's not that night. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. Q Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you've been a President while I respect our current city attorney. This is televised and recorded. After all, our last class had at least two clear examples of disagreement between the council and the Mayor. The examples made it clear that there are limitations to the current system, particularly when it comes to the council's legal representation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was a sexting incident and there was the Great Hall Project where council wanted to retain its own council for analysis. And and so I see that there definitely is a limitation to the current current situation. I like the idea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, and when last Thursday afternoon, Councilmember CdeBaca and I talked about this, I said, I like the idea of having someone that's 100% on state and city council side as opposed to someone who has to weigh or somehow be neutral.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If if there is a great hall conversation or, you know. Impropriety conversation. And so, you know, I wonder I mean, just based on the some of the people comment to some of the people that I've already weighed in, I wonder if the body would support referring this to back to committee so that we can have a larger'",
        "'speaker_3': 'conversation and so that this this can move forward sooner rather than. Rather than kill it and and then redo this or restart the conversation at some point in the future. I don't know what. Madam President, if I should make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'm happy to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a few more up in the queue and so maybe we'll get through them and then we we have that out there. You haven't officially made the motion yet, but we'll we'll entertain that. Councilman, say the block.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I see you up in the queue. But because you're the sponsor of this, I'm going to go ahead to the other council members and we'll we'll let you circle up the group. So, councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. I believe that this is not quite the right proposal to solve the concerns. I actually don't think nominating committees are the right approach for this is an internal facing position. It's not an external facing position.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, the Monitor, for example, has a nominating process in the city code for that because it's very accountable to the people. And the city attorney in this case mostly advises agencies. And so I did not go back like Councilman Black and watch the video, but I recall talking about the idea of a selection committee that council'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would participate in directly. I'm frankly not interested in having someone from the community who's not going to be working with this person day to day to be the one to select them. I believe that it's council ourselves who would want a seat at the table.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I believe there are multiple paths to getting there. That could be through an agreement with the administration. It could be through a charter amendment. I'm open to talking about ways to address the challenge, but for me, this is just not the right solution for this position.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just don't believe in nominating committee is the right approach for this position. I believe having the council in the clients, right. So the auditor and I in my in this case, I would say it's it's not quite the same list of people either that are in the nominating committee list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's it's those independently elected agencies that that I think are the direct clients. So and I believe in terms of the monitor, that's a separate issue that requires separate discussion. So so I am very supportive of continuing conversations about the city attorney's selection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in my opinion, I would not support re referring this to committee because this is not the right approach. I would support a start over where we go back to the conversation that we were having, where all those ideas get vetted and and the pros and cons get discussed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But of course, I will wait and see what the motion is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman. Councilman Flynn. You kick your back up in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to respond to Councilman Sawyer because I was the member she was talking about that had the questions about the council approval, and we had a full and robust discussion about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to tell her that I am going to vote yes on it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Next up, we have Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I just want to remind you that we started the work of the Charter Review Committee last year to be geared up and to allow the opportunity for us to have the issues sort of vetted through the charter committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we had a deadline of having them all done by. I can't even remember what that deadline is right now so that they could move through the Finance and Governance Committee, because that was the referring committee that would then move them to the full council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what we were doing with all of the bills that were coming before us or the proposals was to either say, yes, they are answering all our questions or no, they're not. In some cases, some of the issues were not going to be solved through the charter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They were issues that could be done through through reviewing the I mean, through changes to the municipal code. And so a couple of them were referred back to the appropriate committee to deal with some of those issues. This particular issue ended up Councilwoman CdeBaca did bring the a couple of proposals to the Charter Review Committee, and this'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is one that was withdrawn because it got folded into the work of Councilwoman Sawyer's committee. And so, you know, we all learned last week that this bill got filed. I did have a conversation with Councilwoman CdeBaca about what this would do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I share some of the concerns that we have not really had the opportunity to thoroughly digest how how this would work and to understand how it works in other cities and where we could be even more successful in having something that gives us more voice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've been vocal going back to when I served as a district councilperson, really working to. Have Council, City Council have its own legal council. And that's where I started with with my original conversations about, you know, and this was on the heels of, you know, what we experienced with the Great Hall, where some of us pulled'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our resources, tried to make sure we had a thorough look at that contract and were slapped on the hands and told we couldn't do that, that we didn't have the authority to even use our own resources. And so that's part of why I brought my bill forward that allows us to hire professional services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that will be before the the voters in November. So that in our day to day work, we will be able to hire the professional services that we need at any given time. And that does not mean we're hiring somebody to represent us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But if we happen to hire somebody that has a legal background but brings the expertize we need to help us in our work, whether it's doing investigations, whether it's looking at contracts and helping to, you know, ensure that we have crossed all the T's and dot at all the I's, like with the Great Hall contract that would'",
        "'speaker_5': 'allow us to do that. I really believe that this one needs further discussion so that we could have the ability to. Be able to clearly explain it all to the voters and make sure that it does exactly what we're wanting to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would I would suggest that I don't know that somebody actually move this. Councilman Hines, I think you you talked about referring it back, but I would suggest that we look at the November 2021 ballot time frame and really give us the time to dove into this and be able to discuss it more thoroughly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I supported the amendment, but I'm not supporting the bill moving forward tonight because of those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. And just to clarify, this has been moved and seconded. And a reminder that there's no way to re refer it and still make the deadlines if we referred it back to committee. Just wanted to to put that out there, Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just hearing, I think, some of the commentary and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Interest that some of my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Colleagues have, I'm actually also a I don't feel like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a requirement, like we're not.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Making sure that this gets on the November ballot. Explicitly, I think there are future ballots that we can consider because I would want to weigh. Councilwoman Ortega's initiative around this one and whether or not either or both or if there's some contradiction between the two, because I don't want to lose sight of the one that Councilman Ortega'",
        "'speaker_1': 'has been has been interested in and working on. So because of that, I think I'll also be voting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No on this one, but wanting to see it raised up again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before the spring election. Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. So it's clear that many of you have not actually read this because it does many of the things that you all just asked for, specifically, Councilman Flynn. It does not choose an outside body. The point of this, it's a seven member commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Members on this commission are designed. It's designed to have those independently elected, also represented by the city attorney bodies at the table. So there are there is an appointment by the mayor or himself. The and this flexibility was asked for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why it doesn't say the mayor. But one member appointed by the mayor, one member appointed by the clerk and recorder, one by the auditor, one to by the city council and two by the independent monitor. This is more important now than it ever has been before, because we have a situation where you have a city attorney'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that represents the cops, the mayor, city council and the independent monitor. For example, right now we have a situation and I would have loved to bring her on. I do have a witness available on the call if possible, but we have somebody who has direct experience having castigated cases and then got punished for those investigations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we have no neutrality in the way that we're being represented as independently elected bodies and separate but equal branches of government. We have no transparency in how decisions are being made, and there are hundreds of investigations that are happening right now of police brutality and abuse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not have a system to deal with this. I would love to see our city attorney appointed by council or anybody else but the executive branch, but that's right. Now that's not the reality. And so what this was trying to do was at least give us input at the front end.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Debbie's is here. I mean, Councilwoman Ortega's is hiring outside extra counsel in addition to our city attorney. If we if we were to to do that, it's we still have to take the advice of our city attorney. And this panel makes the most sense, because the city attorney doesn't just represent city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't just represent the mayor. It represents all of us the clerk, the auditor, the independent monitor. And so that is why we should have a panel. It's not a unique thing. This is actually how we do our judicial appointments in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so there is a model that we already use in our attempts to get a neutral judge appointed to serve the citizens of Denver. The one thing the one seat that might allow an outsider is the two appointed by the independent monitor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In theory, it would be the monitor, plus someone from the Citizen Oversight Board. And while I understand that the city attorney's job is to represent the agencies within the city, there is also a perception of a duty to the citizens of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this creates a seat at the table for all of the people who are represented by the city attorney. It doesn't take away the mayor's appointment power. It doesn't give city council any appointment power. This simply gives us a seat at the table in vetting the nominees that go to the mayor for him to choose from'",
        "'speaker_0': ', and then hopefully for us to confirm if Councilwoman Sawyer's bill passes. This is not complicated. This does not interfere with anything. This is actually, in a lot of ways, what we do with our are searches for a chief of police, our search for the sheriff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We create these ad hoc community groups. But because we because we think that they are the ones who are the stakeholders that should be at that table. There are no other people who should be the stakeholders besides the seven that are here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I moved to this conclusion from an original space of wanting an elected city attorney because other cities have elected city attorneys. And we talked about this in charter committee, and I integrated all of the feedback that you provided, including yours, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is what is should be in front of you. But it's clear to me that it hasn't been read, and I'm still asking for this to be put forward. If it goes back to committee, it won't make the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just think that's a disservice to the city right now. We're telling them that they don't deserve to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. Councilwoman, I did read it and there was plenty of opportunity to discuss this at the two meetings of Fingers Committee before you pulled them off the agenda and at the three appointments that you and I had to discuss this the last one today that got canceled an hour before we were going to meet'",
        "'speaker_4': '. I did read it. It doesn't say that the nominating committee is consists of the clients. We are the clients. It says that we appoint somebody and those are outsiders. The a city attorney is not a neutral party. The city attorney is our legal counsel and we rely on them for advice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This whole structure makes sense when we're selecting, as you said, a police chief or a sheriff or if the manager of public works. We would want a selection committee consisting of people with backgrounds in street maintenance, in mobility and bicycle infrastructure, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would make sense. But when we're hiring a lawyer, I don't form that out. And there's nothing in your language, which I did read, that says that you have to appoint people who are with your agency, like would we appoint the president of the council?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would make more sense. And in fact, that's what I would advocate as one of the two alternatives to this, that the city attorney only those candidates are selected by president of council auditor, clerk and mayor and that and then we approve them through councilwoman Sawyers amendment should have passed but the way it's set up here I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'did read I understood it. It came to Councilwoman Ortega's committee in December. And we haven't heard of people that since, until it got a direct file. And that's just not that's just not fair to the to the citizens of Denver to do it that way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The only thing I want to add here is that there are so many different areas that the city attorney is responsible for looking at. Yes, a lot of the claims that come to our safety department end up, you know, being reviewed by the city attorney and many of those end up, you know, before us or for settling'",
        "'speaker_5': 'some of those. But the contracting process is one that is still, I think, warrants some major issues of changes. I work with a a small nonprofit in trying to get a small $50,000 contract that took four months, which is ridiculous.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as we're talking about having a we roll out grants to, you know, small organizations in our community. Many of them don't have the the you know, the the technical capacity to deal with something that just drags out that long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we've got the issue with labor disputes that happen with some of our employees. That's that's part of the process. So it's far more broad and engaging than just interface with our our units of safety. And that's where for me, I want to see, you know, how we can loop the conversation in to deal with a lot'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of those other issues and categories. And if you guys remember, some of you were on the council when we were asked to vote to forego one week of our review of of the bills and do them only on one reading instead of two readings, which we used to have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that was to make the contracting process quicker. It still takes the same amount of time with the agencies. It just shortchanged city council and the amount of time we actually have to look at the bills. And as you know, many of us spend the weekend looking at things that get filed because it's all too often.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Councilman Flynn and I have talked about this and have been working on trying to ensure that we have the contracts actually come to committee so we can see the details of what we're voting on before they move to the floor of council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the clock starts ticking at the time they get filed, not when they bring us the contracts to committee. So it's all those kinds of things that I think need to be folded into that conversation. And that's part of why I would like us to have the time to really be able to have a much more thorough'",
        "'speaker_5': 'conversation about this. So that's why I'm going to be voting no to that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. And I'm going to go ahead and weigh in and then we can bring in Councilwoman CdeBaca back up. Anybody who knows me knows that I like to have all my information in front of me. I like to have time to look through it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to always ensure that the constituency that I represent has time to thoroughly understand what this really means. And although on first blush, it looks simple, I don't want to disrespect my community. I don't want to do something out of bounds when I am their elected official.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And even if I personally feel like this makes good sense, they deserve to have that voice and that saying it and so wanting to honor that and to as well with it and let Councilwoman CdeBaca come back up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we need to determine if we're going to go ahead and vote on this as it stands or if, Councilman Hines, we want to entertain a referral back to committee, but knowing that it will not make the the ballot deadline.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we do that. Councilman CdeBaca, you're back up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just wanted to again address the fact that this followed the process that was set out for it. Of course, you haven't heard a peep since December about it. There are kind of been a couple of things that have been at the forefront of our jobs lately.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's not it's not that anything was being hidden from anyone. It's not that anything new pops up. It's the same it's the same thing we were proposing in December. And the fact that this committee thing structure keeps getting weaponized and it's not a solid, solidified process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not spelled out anywhere. It's not required. It is problematic to me because we are supposed to be workshopping things. I have been in committees where I have asked specifically those who do not agree with the wording, how would they workshop it, how would they make it different?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have been denied any support. And so here we are today. Councilman Flynn has an issue that could be amended by striking out two words and putting a semicolon. And that is what we're that is where we're at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have we have council members who have said over and over that the stakeholders represented by the city attorney should be the ones to appoint. It says to members appointed by the city council to members from the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These amendments could be put forward. And it's not it's not acceptable to say that we didn't have time to see. This was filed on a Thursday. Everything that comes to us on Monday is typically filed on a Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have the weekend to review it. And so I don't I don't accept that this process can continue to be weaponized against me. I have an email right here. The day before I was supposed to be in committee, we canceled city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We canceled it in operations that day. I asked specifically what was next for my committee, and I found out that night that we two of our proposals that were supposed to be in committee didn't even get included on the calendar because they didn't go through charter committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When there are links to the videos of me presenting in charter committee. And then when we get rescheduled, we get rescheduled on the day that we don't have enough votes to get it out of committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I asked on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The day before, I asked Kendra, I said, are we are we actually workshopping this proposal or are you setting it up? Her response to me at the very end of her email was, Our rules do not allow us to kill bills in committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can only move to the full council or delayed to a date certain. Should committee members vote down a bill we'd have to delay to a date certain. Alternatively, the sponsor could direct file. Let me know what you decide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I know that I don't have the votes in committee to get my bill out of committee that day. Why would I waste anybody's time when I'm trying to have the same opportunity? Everybody on this body has had to have my bills heard in front of the body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't make any sense. And I'm sure on the next proposal you're going to have some way to weaponize the process. And that is that to me is unacceptable. We have direct filed multiple things over the last five months, multiple things with multiple with hundreds of millions of dollars associated with them, with huge impacts associated with them'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And there's never been a problem. There's never been a question. And so vote how you wish. But it's becoming very apparent that the rules change for some council members and there is a double standard and it's very clear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam President, the only thing I want to say to the body is that no one is weaponizing process here. Every other charter amendment that is headed to the ballot went through that process very easily and followed the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What we're seeing here is weaponising of chaos. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Since I was mentioned. I just want to clarify that this was scheduled for July 21st to come to committee, and I received an email from a consultant to see the Baucus aide, Lisa Calderon, on June 20th that said, Thank you for your patience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After conversations with various stakeholders, Councilwoman CdeBaca has decided to pull her three proposals from the Fingers of Committee for tomorrow and instead will be direct final filing at a to be determined date in the next several weeks. We appreciate your consideration in scheduling accommodations, accommodations and and so I guess you were counting votes and didn't think you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'were going to have the votes. I don't I don't know if that would be true or not, but we weren't given the opportunity to spend that hour and a half. I actually made it a two and a half hour meeting to make sure we could talk about all three of your proposals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyone agreed to stay for an extra hour, and we really needed that time to discuss it. And when you refer to bills that we have direct filed in 2020, almost all of them were emergency measures related to COVID and getting money out into our community to help people during this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman CdeBaca, we'll have you back up and then we'll go ahead and do the vote. Unless, Councilman Hines, you have an appetite to refer, but knowing that it won't make the ballot deadline.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just want to point out that the four people that are in committee, Deby was out sick. The two people who called my bill out tonight, Flynn and Herndon. The person that told that chairs the committee and told me that my bills didn't even go through charter committee was you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How could I not be counting votes? How could I not understand that you were going to that you didn't even look at the fact that I presented this. So it's not okay to say that we passed all those or introduced all those other things on direct file because it's an emergency, is it not an emergency that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have hundreds of investigations of police brutality and excessive force and no neutral so far. That is an emergency. That is an emergency. And what we're telling the public is that it's not and that's not okay, because there are two emergencies right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is the racism in our city and what our police are doing. And it is culprit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, I would like to move to refer this to your committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Second or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. We have a motion and a second. To re refer Council Bill 836 to committee. Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Quick point of clarification, Madam President. Wasn't there already a motion on the floor for it? Do we need to do something with that motion to allow for this motion? I thought that we had to take action on that motion first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But no, we can have the Madam Secretary clarified, but they were telling me that we could proceed either direction. But we'll go ahead and let her chime in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, we do have the emotion on the floor to order published as amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the motion to refer is actually secondary. And so it will just take precedence. So we don't need to withdraw. We just needed the new motion made so we can go ahead and move forward if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what you would like to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So we're going to re refer this to committee and. Madam Secretary, roll call comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, sorry. Sorry about that. We're getting a lot of text messaging then back and forth. So on process. So, Councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President, I. I heard some openness to changes that could be made to this. So based on that information, I am comfortable I will be voting to re refer. If the bill were not to change significantly, I could not support it, but wanted to clarify that the dialog has influenced my decision to support the referral'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I'm going to, as I mentioned previously in the comments, there are good reasons for us to to change the way our process works now, as in the representation process to council members said about this point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While we have a process of going through committee, I mean, really what I want is I want to be transparent, accountable to the people who elected me actually, and to the people who didn't elect me. You know, I want to be transparent, accountable to everyone in District ten.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and so I think that through an abundance of caution and and ensuring that that we can have a conversation that potentially we can get additional votes, because it sounds pretty clear that this won't pass, as is that if we can if we can have a conversation to to quote Hamilton dying as a young man living charter'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to paraphrase that quote grandstanding is easy, easy. Governing is harder. I mean, I want to make sure that what we do is we have a conversation, we have the process, and we have an opportunity to get more of our colleagues on board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We we are a bi, we're a body, we're not individuals. So having one person continue to move the same thing forward without that isn't palatable to the rest of the council, just doesn't it's that that doesn't move things forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I hope that we can re refer so that we can get more people on board through maybe a couple of words and a semicolon or maybe a little bit more. I don't know. But, but I'm looking forward to creating change so that we do have better representation on council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Legal representation. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just want to I think, you know, heard a lot of different concerns. I have concerns as well. And I don't think that the re referring this to committee is the right step. I'll be in no for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is nothing stopping us from writing a new bill and introducing it in committee any day. But I think that Councilman Ortega's point about looking at the calendar and the map to 2021, since this does not appear to be ready for 2020, would be important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And just referring it doesn't do that. And I think we should take a look at that and plot it out on its.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Course for.'",
        "'speaker_3': '2021 appropriately. And so albeit a no for referral and no, I'm not. Should it should it not be referred? Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And it was scheduled for committee and it was pulled. And far from weaponizing process, what we have is weaponizing chaos again. The independent monitor isn't going anywhere anytime soon. There's no need for urgency or to rush something to the ballot that doesn't receive adequate vetting by committee and not here on the floor on a monday night.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Several things that are problematic with this is that it's changed from when it was in committee in October. And I was there and I did read the bill. The at the time, there was a process to remove the independent monitor, and that's been changed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had asked that the Screening Committee for Independent Monitor, which was then five individuals and is now seven, that we retain the list of qualifications because the people who are screening candidates for independent monitor should have some qualifications for choosing that person.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They should have some life experience. They should have some background in how police brutality is investigated. But there is none of that in the bill. And this is, again, not something that needs to be rushed to the ballot.'",

And that is putting the independent monitors, some of his 13 employees within the career service system because they are not right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And although I don't believe that everyone should be other than the monitor, I think the monitors should have the freedom to appoint, as does the clerk, and the auditor should have the freedom to appoint deputies that will serve, especially policy director, so that if a new monitor comes in, that person has the freedom to choose policy direction'",
        "'speaker_4': 'without having to use the career service person that's been there the whole time. So there's many, many changes that need to happen at this before this would be even ready to consider for the ballot and doing it on a monday night, the week before we have to act on final is just not the place to do that'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. So, Councilman CdeBaca, I guess this question is for you. The wording of the charter change in the in the actual charter versus what is. The ordinance that actually sort of sets out what is specifically the the wording that that sort of governs the monitor itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you be willing to go back to committee, both through committee, to discuss the changes in ordinance? If we were to refer the charter changed tonight or published the charter to commission, I refer it next week. And if so, what is what would the specific charter change wording be versus the ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So one this does it should have a companion ordinance. And the history of how the monitors offices started was started is important because it was first started by ordinance in the code and then it was moved into charter to make it permanent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This does not deal with any of the things that Council Member Flynn mentioned. This charter change changes the appointing authority to city council. It doesn't change the qualifications. It doesn't change any of those things. It bumps out the monitor from underneath the mayor to city council appointing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nobody here wants to change who the monitor is. But it's important to understand the structure that we're working with in this current emergency that the mayor is the independent monitors boss and the chief of police, his boss and the sheriff's boss.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we don't the Monitor is investigating two other people who are appointees of the mayor. There is no. Leeway. There is no independence that is embedded into the independent monitors office. And so we need this not to change who the monitor is, to change whether the monitors boss is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is critical right now. If we want just investigations, if we want just outcomes related to what's happening in our city right now. And so absolutely, I would happily go through if and when this passes, I would happily do the companion ordinance that I think does take a lot more time and it's multiple changes within that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ordinance that do need to happen. And I think there's a lot of feedback that we can get from the monitor after these investigations are completed that could inform the ordinance change. But this is simply changing the charter to make sure that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The boss is different, the appointing authority is different. So just to clarify, because I want to make sure I've got this very, very clear. This is like a two sentence change. It moves the monitor out from underneath the mayor as the appointing authority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And moves the independent monitor to a city council is the appointing authority. And that's it? Correct. It looks like a lot of pages, because what it does when you change the charter, you move the section. When you change the appointing body in the charter, you move the whole section with that with the person.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The only thing being changed in this are the strikethrough, the new added language, our underline. It is not a significant change. It's just that the appointing authority and pumping it all into our city council section. So if we were willing to support you in that change, in that one structural change, then would you be willing to agree'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to go to committee with the ordinance for the Independent Monitor before the vote this November to do the work on the discussions that need to happen around the structural other things with the independent monitors office in committee, and have the in-depth discussions that need to happen there as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of course, and we had a draft and I would love to take more of the Monitor's time to be able to build this out. But considering what he's dealing with and what size staffing has and funding he has, I have been reluctant to also add that on top of this, but I would happily do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So give it. Thank you for that. I really appreciate it. So given the given everything that the Monitor is dealing with right now and given the importance of that focus, do you and given that there is another ballot in November of 2021.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you think it makes more sense then for us to hold on this as well until the Monitor can really focus on this and give us his undivided attention in and back that and and ensure that the outcomes are there before we refer something like this to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're frozen, and I can't tell if it's me or you. I don't. I don't know. Did I unfreeze? Can you hear me now? Okay. I don't know when I stop. Now I stop talking. You're good now. Okay. I absolutely think this is critical right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are not working with a similar timeline for an ordinance change that can happen at any point over the over any size period. And so I think this is critical because we have a duty right now to make sure that we are creating the independence that we need right now to get these investigations done appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thanks. I appreciate your thoughts on that. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. So, Councilman CdeBaca, how did you come to the point where the Independent Monitor needs only career service employees? Don't you feel that it would be nice to have a hybrid similar to the auditor's office, similar to I think you and DIA has appointing power so that if a new auditor comes in, they can'",
        "'speaker_0': 'create their own team. Because sometimes you get left with a legacy team. It doesn't work necessarily very well. So what was his outcome and what was his suggestions? And who in his office and prior to working in his office have you talked to to discuss those points?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have worked directly with the Monitor on this proposal, and I believe the Monitor is on the call, able to have him answer any questions. This is a protection we what we're doing is offering his employees job security.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when you're a compliance officer or when you're doing investigations, it is critical to have that, because if you do something that you're if if right now, his employees do something that is not liked by higher ups, they have no career protection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so they deserve that protection. And this removes the exemption from that. So they're not appointed by the monitor. They're appointed by the mayor? Yes, if you look so if you look down at the section that's stricken out, it says any employee appointed to serve at the pleasure of the mayor for the purpose of monitoring internal investigations'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and disciplinary actions in the Department of Safety and any employees appointed by the Monitor to serve at the pleasure of the Monitor. The appointment of any monitor by the Mayor pursuant to this or any other provision of this Charter, shall require confirmation by the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It replaces that section to just say, the head of the Office of the Independent Monitor. So once again to the committee, did you feel like you didn't have the votes to bring this forward out of committee either? Is that why you didn't go to committees?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because you felt the similar to your other discussion. You didn't have even the votes just to move it forward. I really don't feel like this one should be a problem at all. What my what? My hesitation was on the other one is the blockage of the other two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted these three to all come in a package and I kept getting resistance with them. Coming in a package. These things are designed to work together. So I understand the want, the need and desire to have things come as a package.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I honestly I really do. Yet at the same time, I also feel like the need to have information given to me in a timely fashion, it's really challenging. Like you said in your own statement, given how many things City Council's working on and our caseload right now and everything to have things come last minute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if it would have worked as a package, if they all got on the ballot together so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That the fact.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That this hasn't come to committee and I've got the language at the last minute and haven't been able to do the own outreach for my community that I represent is really challenging. I just need to say that again, and I know that it's challenging to go through the committee process and I hear that you feel weaponized and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that's unfortunate really. It is super unfortunate that you feel that way because I think that that you would find that if you came through committee, there would be people who are there to support you, too, that see these changes needing to be made throughout Denver and throughout our structure and are just as anxious and wanting to work'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on these matters as important processes. But yet when you when they're not able to come through committee and we're not I'm not able to give the time that I is needed to for me to do outreach to the monitor and to other employees and how they feel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's super challenging. So with that, that's all my question. Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the call, would it be helpful for him to respond?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that we brought him in. Councilman Sandoval, would you like to have the monitor respond?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm good, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do have him available.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here, though, Councilman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. So two questions. One, has H.R. given any input.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On how years of service would be calculated for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Folks becoming new CSA employees who weren't before? What I believe would happen is depending on if they had already had been employed with the city, that it would just depend on what pay grade they were before. If they were not, then they would start over like anybody else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How is it dependent on pay grade? If their career service. Can you read your question? Yeah. So the staff of the Monitor's office becoming career service employees, if they've been there for five years or more, if there were regular CSA employees, they'd be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vetted or bested. Excuse me. What happens for these folks once they.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Convert to CSA? Did you want to bring the monitor on?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anybody who has an answer to that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead, Nick.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't see him there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've got him unmuted. Nick, are you there?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm here. My video does not appear to be worth it. Hang on. Sorry. Hello there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Nick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the question I think had to do with if I understood properly a vesting and time of service and then maybe inappropriate question for the employment lawyers at the city attorney's office. I'm not sure if that was vesting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think of it in a sort of pension context. So I'm not sure that I'm the right person to speak to vesting issues. I can't say that I am supportive of the idea of creating career service protection for subordinate employees of the Monitor, his office.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have very difficult jobs. I'm incredibly lucky to have a very talented staff who have a lot of responsibility on their shoulders. And almost every other category, almost every other type of city employee has career service protection. And I ask we ask a lot of my employees to to work on these investigations, to take sometimes very controversial'",
        "'speaker_3': 'positions on cases. And I think it would do a world of good to help build in sustainability into the office for those subordinate employees to have those protections. So if there's anything on that point that it would be helpful for me to speak to, I'm happy to speak to anything on that point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that. Nick, some of the question has.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Been around whether these.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Folks, how many staff are in the Monitor's office?'",
        "'speaker_3': '13 right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are they do they serve at the pleasure of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You or the mayor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They. I hire them, and they serve at the pleasure of the monitor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. The second question that I have actually to that point, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Made a suggestion of a hybrid. Have you had you considered that already in terms of some that would be appointed in your shop and others like your deputies, for example, and others that would be career service protected or categorized.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I think that, um, I think it's certainly worth considering. I think there are reasons why it could make sense to have a small number of appointees. And, you know, given the size of the staff that we're talking about, probably to who would who would serve at the pleasure of the monitor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I think that that's really something I would consider. I think the bill, you know, works as is or at least that, you know, that portion of the bill, from my perspective, works as is. But to the extent there's there's interest in, you know, having a select number of employees who remain at will, I think there's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's potential American idea.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you so much, Nick. Councilman CdeBaca, the other question that I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The section that's stricken. Section eight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of. Eight. Any employee appointed to serve at the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pleasure of the mayor for the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Purpose of monitoring internal investigations and disciplinary actions in the Department of Safety. Why is that section stricken?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does it apply to anyone else other than staff in the Monitor's office?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this so Kirsten can help explain this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Doing it because it's in the this is in the careers section of the charter, which is not necessarily under the department's or under city council. It's its own separate section in the employment. And so this is where there is an expansion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you read at the top of this, it says Career service shall comprise all employees of the city and their positions except one. And so this is removing them from that. It's removing the exemption. It's not it's not necessarily removing the possibility for him to have a hybrid.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is here's some able on how that works. And I think to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Clarify it, whereas Chris Kirsten's coming on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My question isn't about because I would like actually.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For a consideration of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A hybrid for Nick. I totally get what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Sandoval is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Saying in terms of the lack of flexibility sometimes when, if and when.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hopefully decades from now, Nick leaves the Monitor's office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That Legacy offices can be can be incredibly challenging.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Particularly for those where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'New.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Leadership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Really needs to set.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A tone. So I would like to consider a hybrid, even if it's offering language tonight. But this language seems to speak to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Individuals separate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From the monitors office to the Department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of Safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there any other people who would fall under this? Any employee appointed to serve at the pleasure of the mayor for the purpose of monitoring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Internal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Investigations and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Disciplinary actions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm wondering if, you know, maybe the new Public Integrity Office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or Public Integrity Division.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have mayoral appointees. This would then this then apply to them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kirsten, can you explain if this was the if this was put in there intended for the monitor when they move the monitor to the charter? If she's on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She is. We'll get her unmuted. Okay. Go ahead. Kirsten, you should be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So, Kirsten Crawford, Legislative Council. I actually would kick this to John first, since he's the primary drafter. And also because I dropped the call temporarily. So why don't we have you ask your question again, let John take a stab at it and then I can catch up with you all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'John, my question is about the stricken Section eight. Any employee appointed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Serve at the pleasure of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor for the purpose of monitoring internal investigations and disciplinary actions in the Department of Safety. Would that refer to anyone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Else other than the staff in the Monitor's office?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For example, the Public Integrity Division, which was created after.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This section was put into charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was under the impression this would only apply to the Monitor when I made the drafting decision. And certainly Kirsten's on the line. If there's other people that can speak to this, I'd like to know whether that was the intent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. That this would still make sure that the monitor was not under career service, but all of their all the employees of the Monitor word subject.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And I will just chime in now that I hear you repeat the question, Councilman, I do think it's a good point that, you know, there's some open ended language in the in the current language, not the reach that we have here that would allow for or maybe contemplate more than one particular individual.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, the current charter language, which appears earlier in the draft, does contemplate only one head of the office. So if you wanted to capture more than just the the current head of the office, then then you might need to make some changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Point, if we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Were discussing any option of potentially two appointments that Nick could make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or the Monitor could make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That remain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At serving at the pleasure of the monitor, would that be in this section?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is John I can speak to. I mean, if you look to the section right below it, there's a thing about the clerk of recorder I like. You can carve out a number of employees, as has happened in this section of the charter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you both.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Torres, we did have someone from H.R. to talk about the vesting piece. I think we might need to get Kala back up into the queue. But we'll try to do that. As well. And in that interim, trying to get Carla back up into the queue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If it's okay with you, Councilwoman Torres, I'm going to go to Councilwoman. Can each next step into the queue and we can come back. Councilwoman can meet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Madam President, I think this is a really important discussion. And like many areas of monitoring, it gets to where you have actual issues, perceived issues, or the potential of mitigating future issues. Right. So we've had two pretty robust monitors under the process that we've had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the concern about what that might look like in the future and the structural issues, so I take it really seriously. I too struggle with the timeline in terms of the ability to check in back with stakeholders. I don't know, for example, if we have anyone from the Citizen Oversight Board who is interested in talking about their'",
        "'speaker_0': 'perspective, have they had a chance to weigh the pros versus cons of career service for the entire department versus for having a few appointees in terms of their desire to ensure that the office is truly independent under whoever is appointed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would invite, if there is a member, I see someone's raising their hands and the attendees, if they've had time to vet and discuss this and take a position or whether they need more time, that's of interest to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I see it looks like the brand new chair, Al Gardner, is raising his hand. Would it be appropriate to promote him, Madam President?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we will go ahead and get now promoted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as he comes on the. The CLB worked in partnership with us to craft this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Go ahead, Mr. Gardner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Hello. Thank you all tonight. Well, I don't I probably won't provide much context on a lot of the technical pieces to it. What I will to do is speak to the broader consideration of expanding the arms, sharing the independence of the independent monitor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can tell you that the sea lobby is absolutely in support of creating a situation that would put the independent monitor in best position to be to have to have most independence as possible, especially when doing the performing of different investigations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The goal of independence is what we're looking for. And actually, as we go down the road of beginning to talk about police reform and the different ideas that will come to play as we look at these different options, although it doesn't seem like it's something urgent tonight we are entering new territory where that level of independence will'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be a lot different than potentially the what it looks like now. So we're definitely in support of the deal and providing more independence there. On the other piece, when it comes to the staffing, being able to move that under a situation where they will have excuse me, career appointment, that will seem like it will be more beneficial'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as well. As we head toward a more independent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. May I just ask a follow up question? Mr. Gardner, did you all take a position on both pieces of the bill then as a board? So as written both pieces the board supports, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. As well as written both. We had a couple of changes in in wording. I mean, I've had it here. I don't have it in front of me, but most of it revolved around moving the IOM, the O&M and still be from Article two of the administration to Article three, which moves it under the city council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that was one that we sent back to Calgary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, but I'm. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think our legislative council there is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Hopefully they answered the question so those two minor changes. But for the most part, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And so, you know, we're doing what's clearly committee work on the floor here. And so the next question I have is, is one about termination. So we have a I understand that there is a I understand that there is a intention to have a companion ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we have this interesting situation where we already have an ordinance that creates a very particular procedure for termination of the monitor. And I was wondering if either the sponsor or legislative counsel has done any analysis, because I have to refer this night without knowing whether or how the ordinance will change, which is part of the problem'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with this timeline in terms of ensuring that things work together. And so, you know, so so what analysis is there about how this charter change with and comport with the termination procedures that are outlined in the ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I wouldn't be able to speak to you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That wasn't for you, Mr. Cook. I didn't mean to make you feel like you're on the spot. Thank you very much for your participation, though. Thank you. That was probably for either the sponsor or the the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you are probably looking for a legal response, but I don't personally believe that it interferes with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. Jonathan Griffin, deputy legislative counsel we I think his counsel would, like I said earlier, there would need to be a change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The code at some point if this went through regardless. So we haven't fully analyzed the effects of this change beyond the knowledge that we would, depending on what went through both tonight and if it went through and was approved by voters, what would need to change to conform to these changes that are inside of this charter amendment'",
        "'speaker_0': '? Yeah. I guess I will just speak to what I see in the ordinance, which is that it gives very specific procedures to the mayor, which would make no sense. So we would have a charter that has a council as the appointing authority, and then we have an ordinance that has the termination procedures and conditions being pointed towards'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the mayor. And so I do see a conflict. And again, these are not things that couldn't be surmounted. They're things that require time. And I guess, you know, with any charter referral I have, I have two concerns. Always one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, three. One is is what I'm doing legal and everything fits together. And I'm giving the voters something that they truthfully can vote up or down without fear of issues, or at least I know what those issues are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's one. The second is, you know, is it is it a policy that's consistent? You know, I can't vote against my values, even if, you know, I mean, that's just my personal philosophy. Others may feel differently, but I can't reverse something that, you know, I personally don't feel like represents the best that the city can do'",
        "'speaker_0': ', because that's what I was elected to do, is to make that initial evaluation. And then the third issue is, am I setting up, you know, for success in terms of the ability to succeed with the voters and so on this point, I'm concerned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, you know, I feel like the voters already are seeing that there are process concerns and timing concerns. I don't know if those are going to be seized by a no campaign. I don't know if a no campaign is going to seize on the conflicts that's in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I what I do not want to do is have this go to the voters and have it fail and have a set behind this goal that the S.O.B. has had and the community has had for a while.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so that does concern me in terms of the, you know, the intention of succeeding and having all of these questions not answered. And then I will just appreciate the conversation from my colleagues about the appointments as Nick, it's I'm glad you have such a great staff and I'm glad that you feel so comfortable with them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I, I do not believe we can have a truly independent monitor without several deputies that you get to pick. These are folks who might go to very high level officer involved shootings in your dead. You have to feel 100% confident in them for this system to work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I would obviously need to see at least one, if not two appointees that come with this, because I think it's essential for your office to function independently, do not have to be relying on legacy positions for your left and right hands.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that change would be necessary as well. So so I'll just leave it there and listen to the rest of the debate. Thank you, Madam President. I think you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Respond to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've got four more council members up in the queue, Councilwoman. So if it's a very brief response, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. The section.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That talks about the removal, it says that appointment, the monitor shall serve at the pleasure of the mayor prior to any remarks by the mayor, the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the board regarding his or her intention to remove the monitor. And so I think that if that's vague enough that it says if there were if there was an issue, they would still have to consult with council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if this passes, then council is the appointing body. So if the mayor decided to fire the the monitor under that. Under that section. What would prevent us from re appointing the monitor ourselves?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Go ahead. Go ahead, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wasn't sure if that was kind of a rhetorical question or whether you were asking it back to me. Councilwoman, I'm sorry. It's not a question. I think the answer is there would be nothing preventing us from reappointing him ourselves once we have that appointment authority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I thought. I thought there were others ahead of me. Is monitor Mitchell still here?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A monitor. I'd like to ask you just one question. You've been monitor for eight years, correct? Has there ever been an occasion when the mayor has reached out to you and tried to influence you on any of your investigations?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I have questions for the monitor as well. Do you monitor? Do you support changing who appoints you? You know, so I was pretty clear in my in expressing my support for the career service portion of this bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To some extent, I feel that it's a little bit of a conflict for me to opine on who should be, who should have the power to appoint, to monitor and remove the monitor, given that I'm the incumbent in that position.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think my response is that I'll sort of let the two branches of government sort of hash that out, and we'll sort of reserve my comments regarding the second portion of the bill. Would you support having the Citizen Oversight Board have the authority to appoint the independent monitor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I you know, I can see lots of it. I think I would support. Sound public policy choices that will enshrine the independence of the office now and long into the future. What does it look like as it relates to the appointment and removal of the monitor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think I'm going to opine on specific proposals at this point in time, but clearly we need to have strong faith in the system. Community members needs to need to feel that there is an independent voice in the process and changes that we can make as a city to ensure that that trust is there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will be generally supportive of those kinds of changes. Well, I would agree. I my goal is also for maximum autonomy of the monitor. And so the monitor has the resources to perform its mission. So, I mean, I guess how about I ask the same question of Mr. Gardner and you, because that's your job here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So would you support the idea of having the Citizen Oversight Board appoint the monitor? Because then, I mean, the reason why it's like the question is then it's it's not a branch of government at all. It's, you know, that's one more layer of independence away from us, slightly politicians or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think it's slimy, but you get the generalization.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First and might also be able to speak to this because Kirsten and John, we we discussed this as one of the options. And so they might be able to talk a little bit about the appointment power and who has appointment power so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That Mr. Gardner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Doesn't necessarily have to speak on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I am asking him, so I would like to hear his answer. Okay. Thank you. My answer is yes. The answer from the CLB is yes. It just in the short term. Absolutely. Because there again, just to reiterate that point of making sure that and I know the question was asked, had the mayor ever gotten involved in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'something like it, it's more of a broader question of ensuring that something like that never occurs. And from the community perspective, of which is the reason why each of us are on that board, that's really our only drivers to make sure that that type of independence is enshrined in that office.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, yes. And I mean, I would say you're right. You don't want to have that opportunity where someone might ask you for a favor and make you feel uncomfortable. Also, I don't want a position where the monitor even could potentially feel uncomfortable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want I want there to be a total check and balance. And and so that's I mean, that's what I thought of the idea. But since Councilmember CdeBaca mentioned it, just Miss Crawford or I don't know, do you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it probably be John. Go ahead, John.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Jonathan Griffin, can you repeat the question? The question is so I ask that copy are that if they would support having authority to appoint the independent monitor instead of the mayor instead of city council, having a citizen oversight board appoints the independent monitor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I. I'm sorry. I don't. I don't understand how that applies to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we discussed this if the CLB would have appointment power to do that. For a. An appointee of the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is your. So I'm sorry. Here, I'm maybe struggling to understand. This is your question. Can the CEO be appoint the independent monitor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As does the CLP have the authority to appoint the independent monitor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would not believe so for the same reasons that we've talked about before, about how the mayor in a strong mayor system is ultimately the person who makes all administrative appointments unless otherwise granted. The CLB. Would not. I mean, I think the way that we have it right now, where there's a nominating commission that gives the answer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or, you know, that that is involved in that point. But I don't think that would be able to be a charter. But I, I think that would need to be in code and in a similar function to the way it is right now, since the copy itself, I don't believe is in Charter Club.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I need to look more into the question as the easy answer. So more research monitor is also saying, I think certainly worth considering. I just. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. And Council and Hines, just to remind you that the c0b is appointed by the council and the mayor. We appoint some, he appoint some, and then we have some joint. Like the bill before this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm very open to the idea and I would love to talk about it more. I think it's great that the s.O.B. Worked with Councilman CdeBaca to draft the bill, but unfortunately we weren't given that same opportunity to talk about what was going to be in it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's what we're doing now. And so it's like right now we're having a committee meeting on the floor when we're deciding whether to put something very important on the charter for voters to vote for. And I just don't think this is the way we should do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of the questions demonstrate that the bill's not ready to move forward. We're talking about new ideas, and it's a great, robust conversation. But we really all need to sit down and talk about it at a committee meeting or at several committee meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to reiterate the importance of the council process as well as a public process. And moving forward. I am 100% on board for talking about this further.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. And thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca, for bringing this forward. I think that this one is really important, and I think that there's a lot a lot to like in here. But again, I think the conversations that we're having are also really important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think we're discussing some really important things that we want to get right. Referring something to the charter, then enshrines it in their only voters can change it. And I think that is incumbent upon us to make sure that we have fully vetted and worked all these questions out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a couple of councilmembers have mentioned, you know, our independent monitor isn't going anywhere. We have another election next year. And I think that this is something that warrants that full conversation that we should be having in committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I look forward to that conversation and getting this right so that we can get it to voters. And that's right when we get it there. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Clerk. Councilwoman, can I have Councilman Cashman up? Is it okay if I pop over to him and then I'll get back to you back in the queue, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Yeah, I just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Echo what a few of my colleagues have already said. I think there's more than a nugget of good things to be gained from taking this proposal through the process. I mean, 100% fan of the structure that creates the independent monitor and enshrined it in the charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I happen to think we've got an excellent person in Mr. Mitchell filling that post, and anything we can do to strengthen the independence of that office is something that I look very forward to working on. But I do think that, as has been said, this needs more time to bake and I think we're going to come'",
        "'speaker_3': 'up with something truly excellent. And I thank the councilwoman for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So, another one of these. Oh, sorry. My dogs are here. Another one of these committees on the floor questions. So I just am thinking about unintended consequences that I didn't have time to think through. So one of the things I feel like we've talked about before is our inability or our lack of ability to direct'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I want to be very clear. H.R. has been very supportive of the council in the search for our executive director and has always been accommodating. But I may I feel like there's some nagging thing in my brain about the question of running a search like this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And is there a difference in terms of our ability to say, sorry? You must help us with this search and conduct a national search? I just want to make sure there's no unintended consequences hiding in here in terms of our ability to fulfill our function.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we take this on, as if, to my knowledge, the only employees that we appoint now are those that are under our direct control, unless I'm forgetting anybody. So if I'm forgetting anyone, please let me know. But I just want to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a whole infrastructure for hiring that is accessible to the mayor because that's who does that. And so we've leveraged it for our own offices. But is there any issue or is there any limits on what they can do for us and or our ability to make, make, make sure that they are there to give us that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'infrastructure? This, for example, there's cost involved. So, for example, running a nationwide search for a position like this, I'm assuming you want a search firm of some sort. You know, there's some cost involved. So just talk me through anything about any unintended consequences we may be missing here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I guess, again, for the sponsor or alleged counsel and if no one has an answer, that's okay. But I'm putting it out there because I just want to make sure that we're prepared for this passing. If it if it were to be referred.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that H.R., I think, is also on the call. But if we if it's something that we take under our wing, I think it's something like anything else that we would plan for in our budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we had Carla Pearce who had called in. And I'm asking the staff if we have another representative from our.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carla Pearce is with the employment unit of the city attorney's office, which is a little different because they would handle problems. They wouldn't me I mean, maybe they wouldn't necessarily handle an administrative function like a search that would be an employee, not a city attorney's employee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't believe we have anyone for an hour here. So. But to your point, again, those follow up nagging questions before we refer something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I think with that's probably a great Segway. Clearly, there are questions that are left and based on the comments of a lot of my other council members. I would like to move to. We refer this to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. All right. We have a motion on the floor. We have a second. Madam Secretary, or any conversation. Excuse me, Councilwoman. Can each is your hand?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I just. I want to be clear that I probably would be ready to vote in support of this tonight. But if it's referred to committee, I'm committed to continuing to support and help make sure that it gets so whichever path ends up happening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am very committed to working with the community and the sponsor on ensuring that this continues to proceed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. So just hearing all of the comments and concerns by council. You know, when we do something that we put in the charter. You know, this is serious and this is where details matter. And there's a lot of details that are not that still need some clarity and some answers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it's why I supported the motion of sending it back to committee so that we can do the appropriate work in the committee process and be able to thoroughly discuss what kinds of changes people would want to see made that allow us to be able to have a bill that we can all explain, that we all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'support, that we want to move forward to the voters. So that's that's where I'm at on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. That's a better move than they're moving us forward tonight, obviously, because I agree with Councilwoman Kimmich's earlier remarks that to have. Imprecision and confusion and lack of clarity over the ordinance that would implement this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That, for me is highly problematic going to the voters and saying, we'd like to appoint this person, but we don't know yet how we're going to go about doing that or or how all this works that it would that if it were to lose at the ballot, that would be a much worse outcome.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll vote no on re referring to me because it's just as easy to file a new bill, the election as the other election as a year away. And as long as this comes to committee and stays on the agenda and has a robust discussion, I support the concept of us appointing the independent monitor completely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I don't support is all is what was in the draft bill that implements all that. Remember when we changed the Citizen Oversight Board to have more city council appointments in the screening committee, etc. that I actually wanted to do an amendment that didn't have support to have the CEO be appointed entirely by council and not by'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the administration, to have each of the 13 of us appoint one member. And so I do support us appointing the independent monitor, but I don't think it's ready to go to the ballot, obviously, and referring it would would would would see to that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it's just as easy to appoint or to to let it die tonight and then file a new bill as the process moves along at a much better pace. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just an interest. If this doesn't get re referred to committee, I'd be interested.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In adding an amendment to allow for the monitor to have to appointed positions within that language. So I'll see where things go from here.'",

This proposal disrespects the broader community that has already been organizing on this issue, and it lacks any transparency. It's fundamentally flawed.

Our police budget is $254 million and Denver right now this year is investing more than 400 million in social safety net programs, even counting the sheriff's $151 million budget.'",

A number of people have also asked us to commit to implementing the eight can't wait reforms for safer and better policing.

        "'speaker_0': 'And what that does, just by the sheer strikeout, is it disconnects all of the other links, all of the other walls of protection around this fortress of DPD fall down and allow us to start over and decide how we want to protect the people and not that institution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please don't weaponize process. After declaring a state of emergency and proclaiming a directly related public health crisis. We've allowed numerous bills to be direct filed over the last five months. Bills we had one weekend to respond to that impacted an entire city during the most dangerous moments of our existence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our actions and inactions this year have put people out of businesses, out of homes, have killed and hurt people. Allowing the people to vote is is not a sweeping change. Allowing them to vote is letting them tell us if they're ready to make a sweeping change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It may or may not succeed. And the weight of this moment should be carried by all of us, not just us, scrambling to spin every request for information from the police as a meaningful step of action. Let the people carry the weight of this moment, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can't make the changes we're being asked to make alone, and we can't make the changes we're being asked to make without the charter changing this way anyway. There's no other city department with such detailed protections, pay guarantees, discipline policies spelled out in a source document to ignore and not acknowledge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is how, since our founding, we baked in structural violence and racism into our core identity, and that is what is truly reckless and irresponsible. Please give this response to community cries its place on our ballot and let our city decide for themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're intelligent and capable of determining themselves. If this is too big of a change, we can't keep the right to participate meaningfully. We can't dictate what participation looks like, and we can't demand that it is only to happen on our terms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To ignore what the people have asked for is what is truly reckless. To say that there has been no engagement is indeed ignoring the people. I'm specific specifically asking those of you who are putting questions on the ballot this November.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clarke. Ortega. Sawyer. Carnage. Herndon show the people the same courtesy as they as we've shown you. Let this go to the ballot and let the people speak. The new reality is masks. But these masks are not muzzles and we can't keep treating them as such.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Up next, we have Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, we are at a pivotal time in our history. We have a reawakening of the civil rights movement. Don't get me wrong. For many, this movement has constantly and consistently moved forward. But in 2020, that awareness has spread to the public consciousness and have received broad support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In 2020, we're seeing changes in roles of police engagement, including here in Denver. We're seeing new laws strengthening accountability for our public safety, including Senate Bill 217 here in Colorado. I'm proud to say that I personally testified in support of to 17 of the state legislator legislature.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm proud of our state legislative counterparts who worked hard and worked with one another to create a bill with strong bipartisan support. I ask myself, what would bomb do? As in Mom would move our money from places that don't make sense to places that do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let's set our system up for success by creating a place outside of public safety where we have addiction, mental health and social work professionals to train to respond to those particular needs. Let's move our money, including the 690 K that in tonight's bill 20 0759 as just a start to this place which supports people instead of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'incarcerating them. My numerous conversations and in my process include members of public safety, Denver's public safety, and in conversations with that with them, they too want change. They don't want to be put in a situation where they are required to continue to respond to things that aren't their wheelhouse, aren't their training, aren't their profession.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and I think that that is a is is a conversation that we should look at. I'm sad that we didn't get a bill to look at because I've been doing a lot of research about this topic, and I would love to incorporate it into a bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who knows? Maybe we could make a bill stronger than it already theoretically is, and maybe we could engage our colleagues to find something that works for the body and for everyone in Denver. This, but I would say I can't make legislative decisions on a work document.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have to make a decision based on an actual bill that changes actual language. And so I also would say that all the people who wrote in to us, they did so on a theory, on on a proposal in theory and not on an actual bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm definitely theoretically in favor of moving our money. Again, paraphrasing Hamilton, it's easy for me to be in favor of the theory. It's harder to take a position on a specific bill, particularly since it doesn't exist. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam President, I wanted to ask if Murphy is still connected. Murphy. Are you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Around?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can probably get him back up in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I want to ask him a question because at I can't remember. If it was a committee meeting or a mayor council meeting where we talked about a structure that is being put together and idea about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Community was because community is very broad in our city. We're diverse in age or diverse in socio economic demographics. So I know, Councilwoman CdeBaca, you have a constituency of people you deal with. I've heard from a lot of residents that live in your district in lower downtown and other areas who called in expressing some concerns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just wanted to ask Murphy, what is the status of a committee that is being formed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Give.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Direction and recommendations on proposed changes to the budget for safety? And, you know, I don't think we should just limit it to the police department. I mean, you and I had a conversation today about the public safety cadet program that I think should only be for Denver kids.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We pay for years for an education for kids that are not living in Denver. And these are kids that didn't grow up in Denver. And I think that is a program that should be isolated to Denver kids. So, you know, help me understand kind of where we're at in this process as we start talking about where we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'go in making some structural changes that have been part of these larger this larger discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. And Madam President, members of council. We are working.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Remember. Remind us your your role.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I sure can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Murphy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Murphy F Robinson the third. I am the Department of Safety executive director. And in terms of the committee that's being formed. It is a community led committee. We all give history. I started out through the conversations, through my engagement with the community members during the protest and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I started out formulating in committee set by my office when I was informed by council members as well as other community stakeholders that they would like it to be a community led effort. And so I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was not part of that conversation. So that's part of why I'm asking the question, because there were some people involved and a lot of us had no voice in that in that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I was asked to hold off and allow the community to lead this effort. And so that's what I agreed to. We agreed to find a facilitator for this, that the COB, the Citizen Oversight Board, as well as the a member of the ministry alliance, is sharing that committee and is working on getting that facilitator in place'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now. And I believe they're working diligently. There has been a number of community meetings. There's been some things that have come out of that. But I'm also working on in my department to make sure that we are able to do some short term wins as well when it comes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I was promised a list of who is on that committee. I haven't seen that yet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because I don't think it exists, ma'am. I'm not sure that they have set that committee yet. And again, it's a community led committee. And so the best person to talk to is the S.O.B..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Happy to reach out. I guess the last thing that I will say is that, yeah, it feels like we're creating a a movement of trying to bully us into how we should be voting on some of these bills.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that is totally inappropriate for how we should govern in this city. And I have a lot of respect for Councilwoman CdeBaca. We've worked together on many issues. We're working on a lot of overlapping conversations around national Western and some of the issues in her her district, which is part of my old district that I'",
        "'speaker_5': 'represented for many years and have long relationships to the people in that district. But for this particular bill tonight to have been filed without any discussion at all in our committee process and having some input and details of what we would put on the ballot that would make decisions for our city for years into the future is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is just irresponsible for the way that we are expected to govern. And I get that we're all hearing a lot from different people in our community. And this isn't to discount that input. I think we have all listened.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have heard that input. I think a lot of us are talking about what kind of structural changes that we want to see happen. But to do it as at what feels like a last minute push is just not fair to colleagues who all I mean, we do this with our agencies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We expect them to do their homework and to, you know, give us time to look at the things that they're asking us to look at. Great Hall, big example there. I mean, we could talk about numerous examples, but this this is no different than the same courtesy that we expect our agencies and the mayor's office to give'",
        "'speaker_5': 'us when they're asking us to look at something, particularly something that is so broad sweeping that makes such a difference in how our community will will operate moving forward. And it warrants thorough discussion with lots of different people at the table to make a final decision about what should be put on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Councilwoman, Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I just have I spoke today with the woman who was putting this forward. I think her name is Katie. Is that correct? Councilman CdeBaca. Candy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's actually a pretty large coalition that has been involved in putting this forward. They collected over 5000 pieces of input from community across every single district in this city. So the heads. Yes, Drew Johnson and Katie Leonard are here to speak if you have questions as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They tried to also meet with all of you. Yes. So thank you. I met with Katie today, and I discussed my concern about being able to read this bill over the weekend and that it got to Clementine's point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was not even put in register. It was a word document with whereas and so for me, I asked questions such as what kind of outreach have been done similar to the I ask everybody what kind of outreach has been done and who have they met with?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And why could this not have been a citizen initiative? Ballot ballot initiative. And I understand it's during COVID and collecting signatures are super challenging. I understand that because I collected signatures for La Rosa Park and I had to figure out a way how to do it in a safe and meaningful fashion so that people could go and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'sign the petition because it had to be in-person. Yes. At the same time in Council District one, although maybe some, this has been reached out to council districts. I have received overwhelming phone calls and emails of people who were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Flabbergasted at the way that this was done. And asking me questions about the bill when I did not even have I don't even have any answers. I don't have there's not been any robust communication. And so we're working on something that will the city and county of Denver, the Community Planning and Development Department, is working on the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'group Living Text Amendment, and it's been going on for like two and a half years and people are still saying that there's not enough community outreach. Councilman Hines has been and your council district, there has been an area plan that's been going on for a long time that people have asked for extra time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Sawyer and Councilman Herndon are in a planning initiative that have been going on for a long time, that people are still asking for more public process, and that's just to plan a neighborhood. Those are planning initiatives that set the framework for things to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for me, as somebody who is born and raised in northwest Denver and lived.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The 93 year of violence, which I'm sure, Candy, you remember as well, it was horrific. It was awful. I lost tons of friends in that in that summer of violence. And it's no laughing matter. And what's going on right now is no laughing matter as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's so challenging to make sure that we're doing the robust type of outreach that we need to make sure people are engaged, kids are concerned about going back to school. People are concerned about the COVID. People are concerned about unemployment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People are concerned about the police department. There's a whole uprising of civil rights movement that have been has been going on this whole entire summer. And I feel bad that I was not I was not part of the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was not I was reached out to last Thursday. I checked my emails and Katie admitted that she had two emails. So maybe there was another time that she reached out to my office. And if she did, I'm sorry, but I can not fully support this moving forward when so many of my constituents who I feel like'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would have really I'm not the smartest person in the room. I know that. I know that there are tons of people in my community that are super smart and that take this serious and actually really, really want to see reform.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I need to vet things through them. I don't think it's all about me and what I can direct file and making it a conflict between us and up here. Because, Councilman CdeBaca, you make it feel like it's us versus you, and I'm telling you it's not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I support a lot of your initiatives. I supported a lot of things that are going on, but it's the same violence that is happening in our community. It's black on black, it's brown on brown. And we have women on this council and we have five Latinas who can vote together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we all work together, instead of trying to work in silos, we could actually get things done. So in that vein, I cannot move forward and support this. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'll be I'll be quick, because I also will be supporting it. I've heard from a number of District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three residents just since Thursday when they got wind of this as well, who.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Overwhelmingly alarmed at the proposal. And I can't in good conscience or steward of good process vote in favor of it. There's just too many questions that even I have about the language, much less what they have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'About implementation and budget requirements which weren't included.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the proposal. There's no mention of equity standards, of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Training, of accountability in the language.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And while protests have been calling for which I still even struggle with, trying to figure out when we do it, from which part of the safety budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to where it goes. But they've been asking for diverting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Funds from police to public services, not just transferring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It to a new city department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then potentially.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Adding additional funding on top of that for whatever that department may need. It's just it's just too too nebulous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If the city if a citizen initiative wanted to put this forward, they should have. But they're going to get extra.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Scrutiny from these 13 members when you need seven.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of them to push it forward. Go for those 8725. I'm sorry, 8265 petition signatures. And that's what makes citizen ballot initiatives one of the easier things that Denver and Colorado provide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Residents to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll leave it there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Madam President, you just missed my clock chiming at 9:00, so I appreciate that. Is Kirsten.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Crawford.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In the in the mix here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Stacey, could you bring her in? Thank you. I notice that the bill has no attestation from the CAO, from the city attorney's office, that that this has been reviewed and approved as true to form. And that's generally a requirement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm wondering if we can even vote on this other than to vote it down. But usually when a council bill comes to us, it has been reviewed and approved as not approved as the concept, of course, but I assume that it fits all the legal requirements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that is that the case? Because I don't see a signature at the bottom of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Kirsten Crawford Legislative Counsel I just want to kind of set one point of the record straight. One of the reasons I, I kind of punted to John Griffin tonight is he's spent an extraordinary amount of time working on some of the bills that have come forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we take our job extremely seriously. We are very hardworking. We had a conversation with looking for some guidance from the council president and Councilwoman Zita back on late Friday night about how to proceed. Given that the bill came in very late on Wednesday afternoon and we were trying to ask questions about where it might go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just want you all to know that our job is much more than just formatting the bill and signing the sections because our ethical obligations and I think that got really murky tonight about, you know, when we talk about council having their own attorney, our ethical obligation is to city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have to be able to say to city council that we don't have any objections. And I just felt concerned that we didn't have enough time to analyze any of the issues that the bill might have raised.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we got some guidance from the council, women in Kansas and President Gilmore about how to proceed. So we just ended up taking that signature by craft, but that does not mean that it cannot go to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We just have an ethical obligation to fulfill those duties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. I think the biggest issue with it excuse me is, well, there are several. One is the very late nature of it and the failure of the city attorney's office to have sufficient time to review and approve it as as true to form and no legal objection, which we always do with our council bills.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The the biggest problem I see with it, number one, is it looks to me like it violates the state constitution, article 20, which when you read Section three, essentially says that Denver shall have a police department. And then the subset to that sub objection to that is that it also requires that that police department be covered by'",
        "'speaker_4': 'civil service. And this bill removes police from the Civil Service Commission oversight while leaving the fire fire department in. And then it also leaves the police, whoever remains as a certified post certified police officer. It leaves them nowhere because it doesn't put them in career service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It does. So they have no personnel system, so it's just very poorly written. And then that leads me to the the the final objection, which is it violates the single subject rule. And it and the title fails to mention the key provisions of removing the police from civil service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it also fails to mention the. The constitutional issue. And it fails to mention but fails to mention a lot, frankly. So this is nowhere near ready. And frankly, I think the sponsor knew that when she filed it, that she was putting us in a position where we have to vote no.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that then we can be portrayed as as somehow standing for racism and oppression, which is obviously not the case. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Cashman. Oh, I think you're muted, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you hear me now?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very much. I can't let.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Clown car.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sit. We've got 13 council members, a couple of dozen council staffers that work hard every day of the year in the best interests of their constituents and the people citywide. We weren't a clown car when we put the independent auditor in the charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were in a clown car when we expanded the S.O.B., when we created the Affordable Housing Fund, the Eviction Defense Fund, or the Immigration Defense Fund. There is no doubt we've got a tremendous amount of work to create a city where equity is more than a watchword.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it is entirely appropriate to take a look at how Denver has been policed, is being policed with an eye toward ensuring that we're maximizing every dollar spent toward creating a city that's truly safe for all Denver residents and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Inequities have existed that need to be corrected, and I look forward to the discussion that will be coming forth in the next couple of months. It is simply my experience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The five years I've been on council is that we create better policy. When when 13 council members are working together on it. When we take time to be sure that people understand all the nuances, when all voices are heard and when we come up with a solid policy, I can't support the bill that's being put forward today'",
        "'speaker_3': '. It is a passionate representation of one side of a very complex issue. I would not be surprised if down the road if elements of it were incorporated in whatever policy comes about. But I just need to leave with I have great respect for all 13 members of the Denver City Council and all the people that work with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'us. And I think we have it in our ability to create substantive change. And I look forward to being part of that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman and Councilwoman CdeBaca, since we started out with you, we're going to go to Councilman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. Is my audio working okay? Go ahead. Thanks. So I guess I'll pick up maybe where Councilman Cashman set off, because I think that a fair question is, if not this proposal, then what is what is the next step?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that, you know, we have had an enormous councilwoman Zeta backer herself mentioned the enormous number of things folks are dealing with. Homelessness has been a major priority and challenge for council members in all different ways and all different aspects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, there have been others as well in terms of virus response and certainly housing and other issues that have been at the crisis level. So the question that I thought about over the last few days is so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I asked folks to support the idea of a community led task force, and I continue to hope that that path will bear fruit. And I believe that they have good intentions and hopefully we'll be able to proceed. I do think we need an update from them and I've requested that update and I know others have as well'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But I do think that, you know, now that we are a little further along, I do think that it's important that we have a parallel work plan to complement and go along with a community led task force. And so one of the conversations that I think it's time for us to have is the idea of some expert'",
        "'speaker_0': 'support where I've been spending a lot of time with my counterparts in other cities. Austin recently had a very thoughtful, specific plan that involved transitions. It involves milestones. Some of the details that I've heard some of the prior speakers tonight raise that are are not they they do not feel are in this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, reading the math on the wall, you know, it does not look like this is going to be referred to the voters, that I don't believe that that is the end of the discussion. And so I think one thing people are craving is what is the next step?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that the next step for this body might be getting some expert support to help guide that in the absence of one sponsor who's able to pretty much spend all their time on this, which frankly is how it's been done in other cities, it's been a sponsor who frankly can drop everything else, and they spend'",
        "'speaker_0': '6 hours a day with a whiteboard and millions of meetings, and they lead and develop a very detailed proposal. And that's been hard because we've got a lot of needs in all of our communities that we're also responding to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that expert help can help to fill this gap. And I don't think that it has to be separate from I think if we have some experts, Viera Institute and dozens of other think tanks have done analysis of police budgets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They could come in and look at hours. You know, in Austin, they looked at pieces that could be unplugged and moved there. And there's questions of which things could or should be defunded and replaced with other things that need to be funded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some things have a timeline. What does training look like? I think I've mentioned in our committee of the whole that I think we could get much more serious about the categories. Right. There's an independent oversight category. There's a training category.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a category involving, you know, actual police services. Those are different. And they require some different policy analysis in each of them. And I do think, frankly, that having some professional support of, you know, a very strong research partner that can help us and then create a focal point for us to work as a committee of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the whole. Because I hear that in the comments of my my colleagues who spoke before this desire for everybody to be at the table versus one sponsor who is going to figure out all these details in the depth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think that if we were and I talked a little bit to some of you about this, I know I've reached out to council President Gilmore, so if she would like to chime in, that might be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that if we were to commit to having a serious conversation about that and getting that expertize, I think that would help me. For example, with the budget analysis, I've been struggling to get my arms around some of those line items that are not always as evidence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so there may be other documents, you know, whether it's coffers or whether it's detailed expense reports, there may be more documents we need experts to pore through. And I don't think we have the capacity and our central staff and our our council offices to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Other cities have certainly relied on some specialized support to do this. And I don't think there's. And then I my hope would be we can be sharing that information simultaneously with a community task force. And we can continue to have iterative conversations where if ideas come up from one table, they can be shared with the others, as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'well as with folks who are maybe not at that table, council members who've been working with folks behind this proposal tonight. So so I do think it's time to think about a more robust, specific path for us to build our capacity to get to the specificity that everyone's craving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, so that's my kind of thought about where we would go from here. And I'm open to thoughts from colleagues about that. But thank you for your consideration, Madam President, of this idea.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Canete. Councilwoman CdeBaca, we have you back up in the mix and then I have comments as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just to add just a couple of comments on the the ballot question itself actually accommodates for that yearlong committee process with experts. I think we're talking about two different things here. And there's the charter piece of this and the ordinance piece of this and the department piece of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what? We're looking at is a ballot question to enable this conversation in a real way. Right now, we've got a collective bargaining agreement coming to us that has a police salary increase in year two and that is in direct conflict with what we're being asked to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what can we do about the collective bargaining agreement that's in charter? And so the point of this is, if you look at it like a game of Jenga, the source document is that brick on the bottom. If you pull it out, all of the rest of it falls down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is what we have spent years and years trying to do, not knowing what button to push, not knowing which brick to pull. And this single paragraph is that brick. And while, yes, if it is a huge thing, we're undoing generations of systemic oppression.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it should be a big thing and we should be taking it on when we have an entire community behind us that's willing to run with it. I think it's. Perhaps a little elitist to think that there's expertize outside of us that hasn't been already contributed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You all didn't even give it a second hearing to find out who's been a part of it. And we created barriers for people to participate in democracy the way that they should have. When you ran a citizen led ballot initiative, who do the hearings?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who hosts the hearings? Who is the first person that they go to? Right here, City Council Executive Director of City Council. They come to us for hearings. When people try that, guess where we were not here. Guess where there's contact information for an executive director of city council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not here. Guess what happened when they sent emails to every single one of your offices, including the Department of Safety's office? They got brushed off. They didn't get met with. And so we've got some major issues in. And we have to hold ourselves accountable for those things because we've made a lot of missteps this year, and we're'",
        "'speaker_0': 'not taking any responsibility for that. And we expect the whole city to give us grace and we're not willing to reciprocate. And so for this ballot question here, like I said earlier, the people are going to figure out how to get it on a ballot, on a ballot coming soon, whether or not it's the November ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there's also going to be ballot ballots with your names on them that they're going to remember you. This is the moment where you have challenged your community, your constituents, to step up to the plate, to go above and beyond, to work harder, to bring their expertize to the table for free.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're slapping them in the face for having done that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Hines, you're up next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I actually went back to my email. I was trying to figure out why we would not have met with Kitty Leonard. And so I do see an email she sent August seven. So ten days ago, she identifies as a District nine resident.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we reached out to the District nine office. We wanted to make sure that what we were hearing back from District nine, because we don't want to step on toes. We did not hear back from the District nine office, so we did not schedule a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But but that's the reason why we didn't meet with her, is because we wanted to. We didn't want to step on the district nine toes. And her email just says that she's an organizer for Antiracist Club Colorado. She didn't say that she was the lead of the the ballot initiative that actually we didn't know was going to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be filed. I would also say I was frustrated because I met with Councilmember CdeBaca at 430 on Thursday afternoon about the other two ballot initiatives. And she didn't mention that she had I had earlier that day filed a third.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's really it's difficult for me to even understand or know what's going on when I don't I don't have all the information. The last thing that I guess I just I just learned through text message that there is still paper filed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I checked this morning. I didn't see it. So I haven't read whatever bill we're supposed to be working on. And I apologize. I can't vote for or against anything that I haven't read, but apparently it came sometime today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's really difficult for me to support anything that moves that that accounts for 45 or 46% of the city's budget. And I haven't read it. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you Councilman Hines. And seen no one else at the in the queue. I will give my comments last and you know. There's been a lot of judgments about our body tonight, and I have to say that. I respect all of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we just had a council retreat on July 17th, and we started to work together to outline our values, to work together on behalf of the citizens of Denver. And we aren't a circus. We are not a joke.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are a body of committed community members who are trying to do the best damn job we can do during unprecedented times. And I know unprecedented times is overused, but. The entire script. Script has been flipped on us with COVID, with the economy, with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black Lives Matter and historic racism and injustice. We are doing the best job that we can possibly do and I take huge offense of anyone saying that we are doing differently. Because you don't know what our jobs entail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You do not know the family members who call us late at night because they need somebody to talk to because they feel unheard, because they need support. We are there 24 seven for folks. There's a lot of community members who are there, 24, seven for our community, our council aids, our staff, city folks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hear it and I see it day in and day out. So I would ask that we stop being so hard on each other. We stop name calling. We stop questioning each other's intense because it doesn't get us anywhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It takes the same energy to give somebody the grace and the benefit of the doubt that they're doing the best that they can. Or it takes the same energy to name, call and go down that path and. We might not get anywhere with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I know that there's a lot of folks that are asking, well, you know, why did you even let this get get filed? Gilmore. Well. I'm the council president and I've been reviewing the powers and duties of president.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's in rule 8.2. I can't compel a council member to use committee and or stop them from filing directly to have it on the council agenda. I specifically asked the city attorneys, could I of stop this, should I stop this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the answer was denying this would not have been good. Preventing a duly elected council member from trying to pass legislation, I believe is outside my role as president. But what I want to be clear about is that, one, there has never been a council member who has been blocked from bringing a proposal or legislation forward to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'committee. There are scheduling considerations. But blocked? No, never. And at this point, the way in which these have come forward, I helped with process. I helped administratively so that these were on the agenda. We had a courtesy public hearing because that's my job, is to facilitate that customer service to my fellow colleagues, depending on not not depending'",

They deserve the time and the engagement to understand what these Charter changements will mean to not only them, but their loved ones and our entire city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we don't need to keep playing that game of somebody else. Has it worse off than you or vice versa? To know that we're all trying to do the best job that we can do. These are major reforms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They deserve to see the light of day through a robust community process, and they will morph and change based on community and agency input, which will include the Department of Safety and the Denver Police Department as well. None of us, none of us are afforded the privilege to change our charter so drastically without talking to our communities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and one another. The intention and transparency of our entire city matters. And this is a Denver wide conversation. City Council is committed to being part of this.

And now they're having to backtrack. This is way too important. We need to make sure we do this process right the first time to avoid any setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because lives do depend on this. I want to explore and work with community and also our police department to find solutions that will help them be more successful in serving our citizens of Denver. We need to support community members to make sure they have the tools to succeed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when and if a ballot measure is the direction to go, we want to make sure that it is not followed by a failed initiative looming over it. If this goes to the ballot and it is not ready and it fails.'",

I'm not going to repeat CPD's excellent presentation other than to say that this rezoning request meets the criteria in COB Plan 2040 Blueprint, Denver and the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan.

        "'speaker_0': 'We found that 100% of the women were still employed, which is a considerable achievement, given the fact that we hire women who have not had a job longer than a year in their lifetime, and the average age is 39.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We teach them through working and through life skills training, how to not just get a job, but to keep the job and how to manage their lives and get their children back. And really, ultimately, what we hope is that that benefit extends beyond each woman to her family and the community as a whole.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Paul Grannis and I'm a Denver resident. Support for citizens of Denver with the greatest needs is my passion. So when I first heard about the Women's Being project with a zoning application, I was really excited to learn more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over the last couple of months, I bought products from their store, reviewed their financial statements and strategic plans, spoke with the applicant and their consultant, listened to the committee hearing on February 25th and heard from longtime neighbors of theirs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Based on this review, I do not support this rezoning application. I ask you to consider the following. First, the questionable nature of whether or not the application actually meets Denver's zoning code requirements. Legal criteria. And second, examine discrepancies that exist between the testimony given by the applicant, their strategic plan, and their financial statements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First, on the legal criteria, Denver's zoning code requires that a rezoning may only be approved by city council if it complies with all of the review criteria. The lens by which I evaluate these criteria is built upon the logic that a current zoning of 32 on KURTIS has enabled women's being project to provide a valuable service to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'women in need here in Denver. B If this rezoning were to be approved, it would set in motion a chain of events that would remove this service from this building and possibly from the entire city of Denver. C With market forces being what they are and without an operator identified, this rezoning would enable the use of this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'property in a manner that does not provide equal or greater social benefits to residents as required in the adopted plans. The details of the plan goals that are inconsistent with this application are in the briefing that I have submitted to Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': '3 minutes does not provide me enough time to read them out loud for, but for reference at a high level, their first comprehensive plan 2040 goals. 1.94.14.4. Secondly, Blueprint Denver Goals one, two and eight. And Third Northeast Downtown Denver Neighborhood Plan Goals CDOT two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Moving on to the legal requirement that the proposed official mapping amendment furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. I haven't seen or heard any evidence that indicates that this rezoning will increase the general welfare of the city, and it appears that could actually decrease the general welfare of the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Switching gears, I'm concerned about the purported discrepancies from the testimony of the February 25th zoning committee hearing, meaning the discrepancies include first, the applicant painted a picture of having outgrown the property due to overwhelming demand for their products.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This conflicts with their financial statements showing a steady decrease in product sales from 1.2 million in 2012 to only 756 K in 2019. Second, the applicant testified that when he bought the building in 95, their build their budget was 500 K year and today there are two and a half million dollar operation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This conflicts with their fiscal year financial statements showing their total revenue of only 1.6 million, which is at two and a half million or 1.6. Third, the applicant testified that their goal with rezoning is to employ more women.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However. Sorry the screen popped up. However, what they didn't mention is they're facing labor costs are too high, and as a result, they plan on using capital equipment to automate and replace the work of the women that they are employed and helping.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Curtis Park. If replacing women with machines is a reason for cashing out of this property, why was that not disclosed to council members? When was during the committee meeting? City Council? Please help resolve these discrepancies. Thank you. I will remain available for questions if needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Up next, we have the honorable Albert Wedgeworth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. You can go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Good evening, everyone. Madam President and members of City Council. My name is Albert Wedgeworth and I live in Northeast Denver and District nine in the Whittier neighborhood. I was very honored to serve on the Denver City Council from 1999 through 2007, representing then District eight, where the Women's Being project building is located and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have supported this organization for many years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because I also grew up in the Curtis Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wish to urge city councilors to support the rezoning tonight because the organization has met the rezoning criteria. They have worked comprehensively with neighborhood organizations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And others throughout the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To ensure that neighbors will be totally engaged with what will be proposed at the site. But most importantly, this will give the Women's Being project the opportunity to grow their mission to support women and their quality of life to return to the workplace.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the challenging times we are facing in our city, we need more programs like the Women's Being Project for people in our city. So again, I urge you to support the rezoning application this evening. And thank you very much for your thoughtful consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. All right. Next up, we have Rochelle Subfloor. Oh, I think you're on me still.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, everybody. Thank you, city council. My name is Rachel Subfloor and I live at 3327 Arapahoe Street. And I am here to show my support for the rezoning for the 3201 Curtis Street. So I live about two blocks away from the women's game project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to say, first of all, I think that they are an excellent neighbor and they are a valuable member of our community, of our neighborhood. And I think Denver as a whole, I understand that they have outgrown their space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in order for them to continue to serve more women, the rezoning plays a key role in in furthering their mission. And I think most importantly, aside from that, is that this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Criteria as previously sold in the it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Supported by blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Denver the comp plan as well as the local plan as shown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By the approval through the planning board, it has justified circumstances because it currently is a former Chapter 59.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And a very restrictive one at that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Talking with my neighbors, I we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Discussed that or have had casual.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Conversations with my neighbors. The. Of that, we believe that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A limited mixing effect that's being proposed is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very appropriate for the location. And not only that, that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is something that we would like to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a redemptive use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the structure. I mean, living.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In this neighborhood, there's a lot of change going on. And I think it's really.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Refreshing or it has been really refreshing. And we appreciate to have the community outreach that we had gotten from the Women's Game Project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I think that they've done a really great job in informing the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And seeking input.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's I can't really say that I've seen any of that from anyone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In our area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I definitely. I know that the rezoning is being supported by the SEP as well as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The local Arno.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And by myself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And other other neighbors in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That community. So for those reasons, I ask for the Council to consider voting yes on this region. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Angelica and DeSilva.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. Good evening. Thank you. Members of council. Most of you I've wanted to meet all my life. My name is on Hilly, so I reside at 1031 32nd Street. My family has lived here for four generations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I lived two houses away from the Women's Project. I have enjoyed the work and I've seen the transformation that they have provided to empower women. And however, I am concerned with the potential rezoning plan. I'm concerned about the outcome of this plan, for example, traffic or parking accessibility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Another concern that I have is because my hope is that the community members such as myself will have a voice and will be represented and the neighborhood will maintain its integrity and its cultural history. I often walk around my neighborhood, I see all of the changes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have been positive, but I've also seen the changes. Where is it really reflective of me as a person of color? I see the new homes, the businesses, the establishments that are being built every day. But my hope is that the community once again will be reflective of all its community members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Please do not approve of this zoning plan or changes until we have full transparency. What type of business will be provided at the address that mentioned the Women's Project?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's my main concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for having us. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Donald Damon. I think we still have you muted, Donald. There you go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Still married.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stuff that you needed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How out there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There you go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you all. Thank you. And good evening. Members of the City Council Committee. I as well, I, I, my entire family have always lived in and raised and grown up in this park. I heard earlier from someone that testified that that we've been contacted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My family and I have lived in the neighborhood for also three generations. 32 zero 432 zero 30 zero 632 ten 3212. Arapahoe Street, which is actually one lot away from the property in question. It's disappointing in many ways that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when we speak, a lot of these individuals that are being that are speak live within blocks, we when I say we as a family and I, I live within a locked one legal lot away from the being project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Always been a supporter. Not only is order because of my interest in in the being project, but because of having family members gone through the projects at a success rate. I in being at the corner see the traffic has dramatically dropped.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not what it was before. What's concerning about this is I've always been a supporter of the of the being project and we as a neighborhood when I say we the beam project and and as has the community we have endured quite a bit to get through where we are today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I mentioned earlier, we're all within a block radius of my family and I. There are six of us and some of them are not here because of that, are not present because of the language barrier. What's concerning about this is that they the I see a lot of information that's put out by the Beam project, which'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is not true. I speak as an appraiser and a real estate broker, certified appraiser, commercial appraiser. And a lot of what is being said is not reflective of the everything that I've learned in the 33 years in commercial real estate practice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're very. I read everything that's come my way. And what's bothering some of it all. Is that the. My still on. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. The inconsistency the inconsistency of the reports. The big thing is, why is it being project, not being transparent, consistent with the data being provided and being truthful with the true intentions of the reasoning? I can tell you why.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a certified Fraser broker, I could tell you why. They're looking to reason for a larger pool of buyers at a much higher price in the real estate market.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, sir. That's your time. We appreciate it. Next up, we have Keith Pryor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name is Kate Pryor and I resided in Champ Street in Curtis Park. And this bill for 3/2 and Curtis, the Women's Being project was originally a firehouse. And so that's why it's part of the historic district, and that's why it's a designated historic structure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what we're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Finding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it had a life as a firehouse and now has a life as and is being priced, has been a great tenant and it's been a great caregiver for the historic structure, and we've really enjoyed them as neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This community is now they need to look to their future and we need to look to Curtis. And the future life of this building in its new form obviously not going to change the zoning movies. And what we're wanting to do is take it from the section of Chapter 59, which was updated and did take into account'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a pudi that no longer existing in today's zoning code. And so we really need to update this building into its new world of 22 and the current zoning code. Um oh, the um xaum2x is something that they did to the community and they were wanting to find what would be the best options that would actually bring the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'best mix of uses for the neighbors. Just as other people have said, they have been a great neighbor and they want to make sure that it continues to have that. There was a great use as a fire department, but obviously we've outgrown and just as the women's project has outgrown this space, we're looking for something that would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really work well with the community and with this neighborhood and really bring a successful new life to that building. And the, um, x2x really does have zoning protection not only for the neighborhood, but it also opens it up to something that is way too prescriptive as the current PD, which would seem to be as that tenant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm in very much support of this and we I am supportive. This rezoning it does meet all of the criteria and it will be new life to the building. And, you know, things change. It was no longer a firehouse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will no longer be the home of the Women's Swing Project. Those are all losses that we definitely agree. But we also see new opportunity and we feel that this is the best and most appropriate zoning. So please do support this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So get even the members of council cannot be hurt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh huh. Go ahead, Jesse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, members of council. My name is Jesse Paris. I'm representing for Denver. Homeless out loud. Black Star Action. War for Self-defense. Positive Magic. Commercial Commitment for Social Change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado, Universal Healthcare, People's Organization and Mile High News.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I will be your next mayor in 2023. I wasn't either for or against this hearing the testimony. I'm leaning more against it because it doesn't seem to be supporting the integrity of the neighborhood of the east side, of which I am a resident or a native of not current resident.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I reside in District eight at the studios. But. Me personally, I would have to be I'm against this hearing, the testimony from so-called people of color that reside in the neighborhood, that have lived in the neighborhood for generations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I supported what the band project is doing, but I think they should find another site for this because this is not honoring the culture or the integrity of the Five Points Curtis Park area neighborhood. So I would have to be against this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Up next, we have Paul Davidson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name's Paul Davidson. I live at 3230 Arapahoe Street in Denver. I'm here to speak in support of the rezoning. And I just want to thank you all for hanging in there during a long session. I know the Women's Being project has waited a long time for this hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition to being a member of the Curtis Park Neighbors Board for the past four years and the neighborhood for the past 19 years, the corner of my property is exactly 24 steps from the corner of the Women's Project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I hope to provide a unique perspective on both a personal and neighborhood y level. I'd like to highlight two points and then I'll turn it over to the next person. The first is that this application is consistent with all of the city and neighborhood plans, and it meets all the legal requirements for rezoning all of them'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Our neighborhood has an urban context. It has numerous mixed use properties peppered throughout, and they're actually encouraged in our neighborhood plan. It is, of course, common practice and encouraged for properties with the old zoning to be moved to the new zoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the second point I want to make is that Curtis Park neighbors, we did a ton of neighborhood outreach before our board is unanimous decision to support the rezoning last summer women's being reached out to our new president Jeff Baker and zoning committee chair Joel Noble requesting a recommendation from our R.A. on what would be the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'most appropriate zoning. And this is the first time in my time involved in the neighborhood that I can remember someone asking our opinion before applying. And it was sincerely appreciated. And it gave us time to do a significant outreach effort.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We passed out over 100 fliers to homes within two blocks of the property. We highlighted the request, provided an F, a Q, provided pros and cons, and gave direct phone numbers and emails for feedback. We spoke to and received replies from about a dozen neighbors within a block of the property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All were in support that we spoke with of the rezoning provided that it had restrictions. And this current proposed zoning of two X is actually the most restrictive zoning available in the new zoning code. So it's it's pretty much guaranteed to fit with the neighborhood and to be and to be within the context of the residential area'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that surrounds it. So for the reasons above and especially the wide support of the neighbors in the neighborhood, I asked the members of the Council vote in support of this resolution, especially my representative. Councilwoman CdeBaca, thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Jeff Baker is up next.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello? Geoff Baker. I am current president of Curtis Park. Neighbors and I reside at 2422 Chalmers Street. Paul, you did an excellent job of explaining kind of the detail that we did there, and there have been some other comments and support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will not reiterate the neighborhood plans that it is consistent with the city plan that it's consistent with. What I will mention is that we really appreciated how women's being came to us prior. They gave us the option to select the zone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The reason that we were going to. And. With a significant amount of outreach. The way we view many of our situations like this, like liquor licenses, we go directly to that specific area and do direct outreach to people that's going to directly affect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, we'll take into consideration the entire neighborhood, obviously, through general meetings and other community input and outreach, but we do do a focused and this was very focused. It was very explicit on all of the code and the options and the opportunities and being that this is the most restrictive option available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will be entering into good neighbor agreements and that will be the that will be the mechanism to ensure that it fits into the neighborhood and that they act appropriately in a residential neighborhood. It is true that we have commercial in many corners and it has been like that since the beginning of time for this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number two. We did the flier outreach that Paul discussed, which was heavily detailed and went out to the immediate neighbors. And the main opposition this evening, I believe, is out of the neighborhood and never reached out to the rhino.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe that was the second speaker. This evening does not live anywhere near the neighborhood, as far as I understand. And we never heard anything from that person in this opposition. So that outreach would have been nice coming this way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will miss the Women's Game Project. We ask for your support in the Zone Council. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Julie Robson. Well, maybe first we're going to go to Ryan Cox. We'll get Ryan and muted here in a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can hear me now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. Go ahead, Ryan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Hi there. I'm Ryan Cox. I live here in Curtis Park on the 29th in Curtis. So about three blocks from the women's been. I'm speaking tonight in support of the red zone request. Paul Keith and others have spoken to different aspects of the rezoning, but I wanted to comment on a couple of things specifically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm on the board of Curtis Park Neighbors as well, and women's being involved the neighborhood early in the process and was very interested in seeking zoning that most aligned with the wishes of neighbors and as Paul mentioned and did extensive outreach to the neighborhood, particularly to those that were closest to women's being, which informed the rezoning request'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And although Curtis Park had been involved in the process from the beginning and saw it and provided feedback on the rezoning, our councilwoman chose to gather feedback via Facebook survey that may be presented as community input. And although our councilwoman has had no difficulty in posting town halls and other marketing materials directly to the neighborhood Facebook page'",
        "'speaker_3': ', she chose not to share the survey to the neighborhood the right up there, and she used the survey provided background information that was frankly misleading and opinionated. The survey questions were then crafted in a way to produce responses that the draft chapters had desired, so the survey could be cited as having gathered community feedback.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Women's being has been a great asset and a neighbor. And we truly hate to see them leaving the neighborhood, but preventing them from continuing, expanding their mission of serving more women by attempting to block a straightforward rezoning request is shortsighted and detrimental to not only women's being, but the women they serve and the city as a whole'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I ask the city, approve the request. Thanks for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our last speaker is Brian Conley.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello? Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. Go ahead, Brian.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Good evening. Council president and members of council. My name is Brian Connolly. Several of you know me as a land use planner, an attorney with the firm of Art and Johnson. However, I am here this evening as a citizen and neighbor of women's being project, and I am fully in support of the rezoning request.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that, as you all know, this request is guided by the criteria in your code. And I think Brandon did an excellent job of analyzing the application, and I certainly agree with his conclusion that it meets all of your criteria, and certainly it's consistent with the adopted plans of the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I submitted an email outlining the remainder of my comments so I won't dwell on them. I will just note that several of the opponents of the rezoning have noted that they will lament the loss of women's being project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That being said, as many of you know, as a matter of land use laws, zoning can't dictate who owns a given piece of property. And in fact, in most cases, it can't even dictate the exact design of any building that gets constructed on a given property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, here we have a unique situation in that the concerns about community character are really mitigated by the protected landmark status of this property. So thank you very much for your time and your service to our city and please vote in favor of the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I guess, Brandon, this would be for you. The. The building is a contributing structure in the Curtis Park historic district, but it's not individually designated as a landmark, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually it is a contributing in the district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. But it could be designated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is designated if.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There were an application. Were there any discussions? And maybe Mr. O'Donnell could address this also? But but, Brandon, you would know for certain. Were there any discussions during the negotiations over or over this rezoning as to whether that would become a landmark structure at the end of the process?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is already a landmark structure. It is a contributing structure within the system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I guess maybe I misunderstood that it's individually also a designated correct. Ah, the next question is about our criteria. And I was reading the material that Mr. Grannis sent us and talked about here. And one of the criteria is consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I've noticed in all of our rezonings we always pick out two or three goals and strategies with which this application is found by staff to be a consistent. But what occurs to me, as Mr. Grannis has pointed out, several goals and strategies that he finds the application to be inconsistent with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm wondering how does CPD staff deal with an application where you might clearly and I'm not asking you to admit that this is the case here, you understand, but just generally so I can understand. An inconsistency and inconsistency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How does CPD staff handle it when you clearly can see that? Well, this application fits ten criteria in between comp plan and blueprint. But we can also see how it's inconsistent with seven. Does that go forward with recommendation for approval or does it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How do we handle that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good question. So you'll see that in the presentations where you typically highlight a couple of policies and strategies that are applicable, there's usually more detail in the staff report. And then it is a little bit like you alluded to when we look at the number that it is applicable with and consistent with, we have those on balance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with what other ones might not be. And for this application, we think that generally speaking, it is. Marcus's work, mostly consistent with the planners, more consistent and implemented, is not okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it is possible, in fact likely that you could recommend you in the plural, could recommend approval of an application that is consistent with a large number of strategies, but might not be consistent with others. In other words, we don't require that an application has to be consistent with every strategy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fact, that might not even be a possibility, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, that's correct. And usually that comes up a lot when we have like a newer plan like blueprint and then we have a really old neighborhood plan that, you know, is completely different than the blueprint. So it's it's all about a balancing.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, now we got.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You got me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, huh? Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Yes. For someone from the Beam project. If someone can answer this. Mr. Grant has sent us a detailed, some detailed information. I was just very interested in looking at and seeing that since 2012, the overall sales seem to have declined from around a million to to about 700,000 in last year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And just want to understand that, since my understanding is the idea in selling is to get a larger facility that will have the ability to help more people generate more more bodies. Anyone can answer that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had Tamara Ryan, who was representing the Women's Being project. Hopefully she still.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'President Gilmore, this bruising. I'm sure I'm around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm still here. Yeah, that's right here. I'm still here. I was just in nether land, so I would be more than happy. And I've offered this a number of times to talk with anyone about, first of all, the difference between an operating budget and audited financials and also the intricacies of how a nonprofit financials are reported'",
        "'speaker_0': 'when you also have sales and how net sales are reported. And so all of those financials are are provided on our website. And but don't give you the color of things like we have grown in certain areas and we have also taken write offs for growth in grocery.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and what I will tell you is that it's not it is both about sales is about creating jobs and is about having enough space to employ enough women. So we have challenges with respect to purchasing materials are being supplier recently told us that our minimum order quantity now is doubled which means that 50 foot truck needs'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to come and offload 20,000 of beans to our site. We don't have space for that. And we are at the point where nearly every week we have some sort of a challenge relative to space that impacts both the business, the number of women we can employ and how we can deliver for our services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is that that's the whole story and really cannot be accurately reflected in financials on our website.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, but is it is it true that your your sales have decreased a bit further for the reasons you've just stated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For one year, 2019, they decreased in this past year, they increased 30%. So taking a snapshot of one year makes it difficult to look at what to surmise that there is a trend. And again, I'd be more than happy to sit with anyone and go into more detail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not really relevant to the criteria, so we don't need to spend too much time on it. Ms.. Ryan, I appreciate that answer, and we'll let you keep your energy for questions that are really related to your zone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'That's actually what I was going to ask. Could be the business model is not related. That's not one of the criterias. And I mean, it's not even. Remotely. Any of the criteria is right. So we can't make any sort of judgment tonight based on the success or failure or lack of success of of any entity, including the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'women's project. Is that right? The party's analysis is strictly with legal criteria. Okay. And, well, we could. Well, I guess maybe. Looks like Mr. Griffin is still here. So from the city council attorneys perspective, I hear CBD saying that it's not within your legal criteria.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not within our legal criteria either. Right. Is that is that just talking with the city council attorney?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Well, I think we've got Nate okay with us, so we'll let Nate weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Come on down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Hines, what was the question again? I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The question is that we're you know, we're obviously we're considering a rezoning at this point. And we have five legal criteria through which we should make our quality judicial decision. None of those criteria consider the success or failure of any business model, including, in this case, the Women's Bean Project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's like we we must remain blind to whether the whether any entity has a good or bad business model. Is that is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for repeating it. I was listening to your commentary and I agreed with it. And so when the question came up, I was like, was there a question there?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But yes, thank.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You, Councilman, that you're correct. Okay. Thank you. And this is of which I'm curious the the comment of the councilperson which district doesn't in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are we are in District nine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Well, I'd be curious to hear her comments. So. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to ask a question. I don't know if former Councilwoman Oprah Wedgeworth is still available. If you are ever. Would you mind? Coming back on for just a minute. I have a question of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, we're going to. Can you ask her to raise her hand in the list of attendees?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do you see her still on?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I don't. Maybe. Maybe, Brandon, you might be able to answer this or Nate. So when the city sold this property originally to the Women's Being project, I remember this being at a significantly discounted price. And I'm wanting to know if there were any reverted clauses in the sales price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know. What is now our host office. It used to be dildo or OED before that routinely has reverted clauses in a number of their contracts when they sell property to different nonprofits. If they're. Operations, you know, go out of business or they're going to move or whatever that requires the property to revert back to the city'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So I wanted to ask if that was looked into by your office or by the city attorney's office to to just confirm that you don't have that as an issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I believe we have Skye Stewart, who's available, too, to answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yep. Thank you very much. Sky Store Mayor's Office. I think there has been a little bit of a misconception about that. The city actually did not sell it for less than market value when the property was sold in 1995 for $185,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The assessor's records for that year were an assessed value of 183,900. So the city actually made a little bit more than the assessed value on that. So it was not sold at a loss at all. And and because that was a market transaction, there was no revert or clause or any other conditions on the property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's that's helpful clarification. And then I just wanted to ask Miss Ryan, there was a comment made by one of the speakers about and I know this is not part of the criteria, but, you know, it's part of the reason for the change is to create the opportunity to grow.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But you're going to automate, which means you potentially would reduce the number of women. Is that is that accurate? And let me just do that first and then our last look.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks for that question that we had in our strategic plan. We talked about automation. And what we realized ultimately was that we were really headed more toward semi automation. And ultimately we have several stops along any production line that includes now filling machines and sealing machines that all have to be operated by individuals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact, what we've learned in that is that not only do we need the same, if not more women based on volume, we actually are teaching skills that are much more relevant to the workplace when the women leave.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is no scenario in which a woman will graduate. Women's being project can go on to landfill, being to mixes. And so what we are teaching them is, is how to operate the equipment, how to troubleshoot with the computerized panels, how to clean the equipment, how to meet food safety standards that are more complex with with machinery'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so what the what we didn't even realize when we were talking about automating our processes is what great opportunity it would actually create for the women. And that really full automation is not going to be possible. That really it's much more a semi automation process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And part of the reason for looking to grow is or looking to make make this changes so that you can grow. And I'm assuming that means looking for a bigger building elsewhere, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that is correct, yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have you identified something else that's sort of contingent on this rezoning? And I don't know if you have an option contract on the if somebody has an auction contract on the property. But. Does that then? You know, afford the ability for you to stay in Denver or are you looking elsewhere?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We absolutely always we're committed to staying in Denver. When we started this process, we did not have a new home. We now have identified a new location and on Alameda in Councilman Clark's district. And we will be we will be occupying this new location adjacent to Denver Housing Authority and some new housing that they will be building'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Okay, great. All right. And I saw that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This back on the line. But I don't know. Number one, if you heard my question, it sounded like that was answered. But I wanted to give you an opportunity to see if there was anything more that you wanted to add.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, I didn't hear your question. Can you repeat it, please? I was just double checking about whether or not there was a revert or clause in Skye. Stewart from the mayor's office clarified that the building was sold at market rate and therefore there were there were no provisions placed on the sale.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that's my understanding is. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. I have no further questions. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman, and thank you to our speakers. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0161 is closed. Comments by members of Council. All right. I'm not seeing. Oh, here we go. My Internet said it was unstable for a second.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'But I just didn't see the councilperson for this district. It must not be online anymore. And so I just wanted to make sure to say for the record that thank you to staff. I think that this has been demonstrated that it meets the legal criteria for rezoning, and I will be supporting it this evening before we voted'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Thank you. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. I just put my video down, so maybe my Internet's going to work a little bit better. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In Tibetan president. So at one point, a very, very long time ago, that used to be part of my council district, part of the Curtis Park neighborhood, used to be part of District nine. Back then, at times it was changed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was not in the district. So I'm very familiar with the neighborhood and of the original sale of this property to the Women's Project. And they have been an amazing employer. I mean, they're the epitome of a a genuine social enterprise that is working with women coming out of our prison system that are gaining a skill set'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and as we heard, are gainfully employed as a result of coming through this program, which I think we need so much more of these kinds of projects that need to be tied to our shelter system and all of that that really helped people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman So you and I have talked about the delay and see Street Project and how successful that model has been in San Francisco. And anyway, I digressing here, but this particular operation has has just been a magnet in this community for for so long since they purchased this property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And again, you know, they meet all the criteria. Glad to hear that they are staying and have found a place in Denver on a bus line that gives them the opportunity to grow and to provide even better skills with some of the automation and whatnot to the women that will be going through the program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'll be supporting this tonight. So I just wanted to chime in. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Seen no other comments by members of council? This proposal has has met all of the criteria and guidelines, and I'm happy to support this rezoning. Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",

You can see the subject property in the far right photograph there and then some of the surrounding properties, including the five storey apartment building immediately to the west in the left.'",

This is different from the proposed zone district context of general urban. However, Blueprint Denver says it may be appropriate to shift the boundary or subtly change the the future neighborhood context in certain situations'",
        "'speaker_3': 'where the overall intent of a neighborhood context map still can't be met. In this area, it's between urban and set, an area where an urban context interfaces with an urban center context. Those in our transect are not adjacent to each other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'General urban falls in between. So providing a general urban context here, the zoning is appropriate to serve as a transition from that urban center and more intense context to the less intense urban context. The Future Place designation is Community Corridor, which calls for a mix of office, commercial and residential uses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are not necessarily all on the same property. Properties can be all one use, but throughout the entire corridor of those, those uses should be mixed in.

        "'speaker_3': 'The future growth areas strategy for this property is community centers and corridors intended to accommodate 20% of new jobs and 25% of new housing by the year 2040. And then Blueprint Denver also includes additional strategies and recommendations, including this one land use built form, general policy, one strategy talking about directing growth to appropriate areas, including community corridors'",
        "'speaker_3': 'where transit priority streets are planned and Evans Avenue is designated a medium capacity transit corridor in the plan. So directing growth to this location is appropriate and the proposed rezoning is consistent with the recommendations of the Denver. The third plan is the Overland Neighborhood Plan.'",

Maintaining the residential character of the residential neighborhoods, encouraging reinvestment and investment in underutilized or vacant land with appropriate character and density. Again, this property serves as a transition from the lower density residential areas to the more intense mixed use and industrial properties to the Northwest.'",

The third criterion is to for the public health, safety and welfare of city staff. The proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adaptive plans and promoting additional housing options near a transit station.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances specifying for the proposed rezoning justified by change and changing conditions in the area. There's been new development around the station and on the north side of Evans increasing density, creating more of a mixed use transit oriented development.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And sometimes that's without a train running. And I did all of that today and a few weeks ago, actually, because it's gotten louder around here. This kind of development would be more appropriate north of Evan's, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that the health and safety of any potential future residents, low income or whatever it is, I think that they would not benefit from this and their health would be harmed. I want to know if there are any environmental investigations that are going to happen recording this.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And I will show you how loud it is here. Without any traffic, it's probably more like 90. That's that exceeds the HUD, the Housing and Urban Development Regulation 24 CFR Part 51 Subpart B. And. This would be more appropriate.'",

So I want to know if the occupant has asked about a traffic study, a noise study and also a pollution study. Because if you're going to put housing here, I'm assuming, and I wanted to know what the RMR level was going to be for that'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I believe it was, Dana, about notification. And what was what happened with notification? Yeah. This application followed our standard notice procedure, which is that the capital register neighborhood organizations were notified by email of properties within 200 feet, were notified when the application was received and before planning board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't mail postcards before City Council. That's how it's set in the zoning code. And then the property was posted with the notice sign. So this application met the standards. That's why she didn't receive a postcard before this hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Should have received two postcards before the planning board hearing. Okay. And then the the what is on. So what is currently on site is not what the current zoning is looking at. It looks like it's single family homes that does share an alley with a five story building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. Correct. And then the existing zoning that is being asked to change from a you RH 2.5 into GMU three. And so could you just get a quick roll through? You know, not the difference of what it would look like from what's on the ground today to this news on district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But between what could be built used by right. And this existing zone district. Yes, certainly. So there you are. It's 2.5, as you said, in the current zoning, which is rowhouse zoning with a two and a half storey maximum height.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the applicant or the property owner could build row houses, as the name implies, up to two and a half storeys or 35 feet. Under the existing zoning by right. And were we able to promote the applicant and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I can't see you, Kevin. But if you're there, can you talk a little bit about why you're why why you were going after this zone district versus the used by rate zoning that's already on there?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Can you hear me okay?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kevin Dickson and live at 1491 South Gaylord. My partner and I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have owned this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Corner for about 12 years and the RH zoning, the other developers have been doing a row houses or townhomes that are selling for six and 700,000. And with the state of the affordable housing in Denver and the lack of it, we felt like the $700,000 townhomes, even though we could build ten or 12 of them, wouldn't be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'helpful. So we were looking at a small 20 unit apartment building and going for a more market rate, affordable one bedroom units and maybe some two bedroom units there. And this zoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would allow with the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additional units and keep the cost per unit down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. And then you have you have any energy efficiency kind of you know, that's one of the criteria that we look at is, is with climate change, some of that and some of the other projects that you've done in Overland, I know you've done some other kind of think outside the box of anything planned with this when'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it comes to energy efficiency in construction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, as you know, John, we've been building tandem houses in Overland and they've all been turning out to be zero energy, some of them that are kept as rentals and I pay the utilities and so the tenant. Doesn't have a utility bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And since I'd put so much solar on the house, Xcel Energy is sending me a check every month. And even though this 20 unit building would be much bigger, we should still be able to achieve zero energy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you're looking for the whole the whole building. You think you're going to be able to get it. You are basically a net zero. Right. Okay. And then, Scott, one of the plans that always comes up in Overland is the Overland Neighborhood Plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't have it right in front of me, but remind me, it's from what year do you have it there? Yes, it's from 1993. 1993. Okay. I'll I'll opine more on that in the comments. But I just wanted to quickly be reminded what year that was from you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are all my questions. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Up next, we have Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Mr. Robinson, I've got a question for you about noise levels. 150 to 160 decibels, 140 decibels. Looking at the chart that I just found online, is a jet taking off. So it's. Is it possible that we have a neighborhood that has 150 to 160 decibels?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I guess that is not a question. Let me rephrase the question. Assuming that is accurate, is that something that would affect the health, safety and welfare of a neighborhood and affect all of the zoning of anything that has that kind of notable noise level?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Potentially, as you said, you know, I'm not an expert in noise levels. When we get a rezoning application, we refer to multiple city agencies, including the Department of Public Health and Environment. And they are very good about reviewing these applications and providing comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you have those comments provided by THC in the staff report. They didn't mention anything about ambient noise levels. There's information in there about construction and the requirements you have to meet during construction, but they didn't raise any concerns about the existing noise level and we refer to them on those kinds of issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a bunch of construction around this site? I mean, I guess it's a high rate, but like what might be contributing to the noise level? I guess I could ever ask the applicant instead of asking you. So I want to redirect the question to the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there other construction around this site? And then I want to ask you for your thoughts on are there really sustained noise levels of 150 decibels in this area?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks for the question. There are trains that sit there and idle next to the light rail station. And so you'll have about three diesel electric locomotives just sitting there idling. And that's probably the loudest thing there. Evans Avenue is busy and it's loud.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then just beyond the railroad track is Santa Fe. And so it's not like a jet taking off. No, but an idling diesel is kind of loud. But our building would block.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The noise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For this, Jamison. So it would actually help her because it would it would be three story building in between her and the railroad tracks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, that's very kind of you to take this on for her. Okay. I don't have any other questions. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's her trying to open everything back up. Thank you. I have a couple of questions, both for the applicant as well as for Mr. Robinson. So when you all first saw this application, did you all look at how close that is to the railroad?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And were they asked to check the box on the application form that they're within a close proximity? Think 200 feet is the distance to rail existing rail lines. Scott, your muted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Let me look at the application here and see if that. This, actually, I think. Interesting. This this application is several years old. It came out in 2017. And then it went through that mediation process, which is why it's just now getting to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I believe that the application was submitted before we had the the roadblocks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Were roadblocks should have been in place for the last two years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And so this came in 2017. So three years ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So and so there's been no updates to it even during all that time to address railroad safety. Because when we talk about health, safety and welfare, that's a critical component of safety issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, certainly. And, you know, as we've talked about before, those issues are generally dealt with at the site development plan and building permit stage. So about to meet all the standard requirements, go through the standard review when they go to start construction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So let me see. I think I had one more for you. Who generally checks the notification to ensure that the signage on the property that is notifying the neighbors as of rezoning that it is posted so that all the neighbors can see this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. The applicants have to provide a signed up. David saying the property has been posted and then provide photographs to us of the property with the sign posted. And so we review the affidavit and the photographs they provide to make sure that it has been posted properly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and how do you ensure that the placement actually is the most visible for the neighbors to see? A statement from one of the speakers about her concerns that the actual location was not that visible for the neighbors to see.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know in the past we've had applications that have been held up so that the signage could be done properly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, certainly. So we check to make sure that it meets the legal requirements and our our guidelines, staff guidelines, which are that one side be provided on each product. And so we again look at the photographs and make sure that signage is posted on each frontage without necessarily looking for the the best, best location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, you might find out that it meets the legal requirements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And I do have one last one for you before I go to the applicant. In your statement, you mentioned there was no agreement with the property owners. Can you highlight what some of their issues were based on?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The. Important that your agency received.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I know, I've probably deferred to the outcome on that. They were involved in that mediation, but my understanding was I was concern about the scale of development for the proposed proposed development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So. Mr. Dixon, if you can. Come on for a minute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Yeah, we will.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you just highlight what those issues were? I heard two comments about concern about traffic. We heard that about noise. It sounds like a lot of that's from both Evans as well as the railroad tracks. But can you just highlight what those other issues were?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So we went into mediation and the main issue was the parking and we originally providing about eight parking spots for 20 units and. So mediation started in late 2018 and in 29, early 2019, we purchased an additional duplex adjacent and that was going to give us four more parking spots.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we increased the amount of parking that was going to be proposed, and this was all laid out in the good neighbor letter. That was. Ready to be signed in 2019. But one of the close neighbors that was objecting actually passed away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then another one is the one that we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bought the duplex from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and there was one neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Left.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That we were.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Under contract. But I couldn't get that contract closed in 2019. And so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just kind of fell apart. And the mediator wrote a letter to that effect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for that explanation. Parking was going to be my second question for you. So, Scott, for a 20 unit development, that's I don't know what the distancing is that we use as justification for within the proximity of a rail corridor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what is the required number of parking spaces for a 20 unit development?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't have that up to my head. If you give me just a minute, I can put that up. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know some of those were going to be two bedroom units as well as as one bedrooms. So just wanted to get an understanding of the city requirements on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we'll go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And while you're doing that, I just wanted to ask Mr.. Dixon, if you wouldn't mind just sharing if you're looking at accessing any of the low income tax credits through the Colorado Housing Finance Authority to try to address the affordability of the units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. We met with Scott Robinson on that topic and it didn't really seem to fit. We just felt like we could go ahead and build 20 units and rent them at market rate. And I have other rentals in the area and you know, a one bedroom apartment for about $800 is relatively affordable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's the type of thing we were targeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How how big are those one bedrooms? Just out of curiosity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would be around six, 700 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Thank you. Scott, were you able to find that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have the standards. The standard parking requirements in the urban context for multiple zones is one vehicle per unit. And then there are various exceptions that could be applied. So that's what I still. Trying to check those to see if that could reduce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But those details will be worked out when they go through the design and development review process. Correct your agency. But I think just having some understanding that those are going to be worked out so that the neighbors are having to deal with extra traffic on the streets and that kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Traffic is already a concern in the area and I know this looks like a site that abuts the sort of the underpass of of Evans down there. But still, if it's generating more traffic on the on the residential streets, I think those are what I was hearing as concerns from the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That concludes my question. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0612 is closed. Comments by members of Council Councilman and Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President, and thank you, Scott, for the presentation. Thank you, Dana, for coming down to speak. I'm sorry that somehow that notification didn't get to you.

        "'speaker_3': 'of neighborhoods, including other neighborhoods that I represent and have no plan at all, have literally never had a planning effort. And so I'll continue to plug and we need to move quicker and more aggressively to make sure that every neighborhood has an adopted plan that's recent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On top of that, I can't complain too much about that right here because we do have the urban stationary plan, which is much more recent and does reflect the community conversation that we've had around this area. I just think that there's this missing piece in here is that even though we have this newer plan that was a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'great process and the neighborhood was very involved in, we still also have to tie back to a plan from 1993, the year that the Colorado Rockies were an expansion team playing at Mile High Stadium, the old Mile High Stadium, where literally half of the stadium would float on water and move.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a different world. And the relevance of that plan to today is. Nonexistent and it's bad, especially when we have another newer plan. I don't know how we break and how we break up with these old plans until we get the new ones.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think this is a perfect example of one where I don't think we should continue to be lining up with that plan when we have a two year plan. In the parts of Auckland where that plan doesn't reach that stationary plan doesn't reach in the Broadway station plan, and it's literally the only plan we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe that's better than having no plan at all. But in areas where we have newer plans, somehow breaking up with things that are that old and and not even for the same city that we live in today. I think a couple of things that, you know, the community was very intentional in planning around that that light rail'",
        "'speaker_3': 'station and about where density would go. And this is one of those places that does create that buffer between Evans in the same way that the five story of the beautiful building there that looks like it's been there forever but is relatively new.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That five storey building provides some buffer between the light rail tracks and the consolidated mainline and the neighborhood. This court, this part of Evans adding a little bit more density. There is something that buffers and will ultimately make it quieter because it will reflect some of that noise back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I always appreciate my colleague, council member Ortega, who I was very lucky to sit on the committee that looked at, you know, train safety with her. And, you know, I'd love that she continues to push to make sure that we're living up to making sure that that is a part of our process.'",

Then there's RTD tracks and there's a station, a parking lot, a road, a five story building, an alley, then this property. And so well, it is definitely close enough to walk right over to a wonderful station at urban station.'",

But some of the ones that we have seen literally there is building right on the railroad will have.

        "'speaker_3': 'And then I'll go over and over when you meet a constituent and Kevin and they show me that it can be done and it is being done in Denver today.
