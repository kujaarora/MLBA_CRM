    "Moratorium on Small Zone Lot Parking Exemption for Certain Projects.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'It has moved in second to the public hearing for council bill 498 is open. May we have the staff report? And that's going to come from our very own councilman, Casimir.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Well, thank you, Mr. President. The parking exemption for small developments officially known as the small zone, light vehicle parking exemption for parcels of 6250 square feet or less was was initiated in the Main Street Zone districts, primarily Mass one in 2006.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The goal was to promote re-use of existing buildings and to stimulate small scale development on these smaller parcels that had access and parking challenges rather than encourage assemblages of multiple lots for large scale development. When the new zoning code was passed in 2010, the small parking exemption was extended to all mixed use zone districts, hoping again to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'stimulate small scale commercial or residential developments. In nine years, we've had one building built using that exemption. It's a three storey project comprised of ground floor commercial with nine dwelling units. There are currently ten projects in the pipeline in various stages of review.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are about 5300 small parcels in mixed use districts across the city. Some are already combined and have buildings on them. Several hundred are city or state owned. Denver's affordable housing crisis has changed the residential landscape. A new element has come into the inventory called micro housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a result, the small parking exemption now, as now written, leaves the door open for a development on small parcels that far exceeds the original intent to head off further damage to the community council president Brooks. At the prompting of a dedicated group of concerned neighbors, has proposed a seven month moratorium to give time to craft a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'more protective ordinance. During his absence from council, I was pleased to help move this through the process. If the moratorium passes, it is our intention to form a broad based stakeholders group to excuse me to exist in the work of crafting that more protective ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would like to pay tribute for a whole lot of advance work done by former District ten Councilwoman Jeannie Robb, who worked with a similar group of stakeholders and came up with a proposal that may or may not be the final outcome of a new group, but will definitely help get things rolling in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The councilwoman simply ran out of time before she was term limited out of office. So with that, Mr. President, let's hear from our speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, excellent job. And I'll just add to Councilman Cashman and just thank him. I was out for a month and Councilman Cashman picked up the ball on this important issue. So thank you so much. And now we're excited to hear from you, all the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have 11 speakers for council. Well, for 98, I'm going to call the first five speakers and I'm actually going to use this area for the speakers to sit. They may be able to squeeze on there, but if they can't, if you can find out, see, that'd be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. We'll call Bob Hickman. Margie Valdez, Doug. Greg Craig. Vander Lynn. And David Engel can come on up. And Bob Hickman, you're up first and you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. My name is Bob Hickman. I live at 1091 South Gilman Street in Denver. Good evening, council members. And good evening, Council President Brooks. It's very nice to see you. You. Allow me to read from our current zoning ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not to be too repetitious here, but section ten .4.5.1 A which deals with preexisting small zone lots. It says in all mixed use, commercial zone districts, buildings on zone lots which are equal to or smaller than 6250 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An area on June 25th, 2010, shall be exempt from providing parking otherwise required by this division.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One sentence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How could one sentence in the ordinance be of such concern? How could one sentence, with the simple goal of encouraging development of small lots while limiting negative impacts, become such a big deal? What has brought this moratorium to your attention tonight?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It came to our attention when we became aware of four projects being developed, or two, depending on your point of view. 1570 and 1578 Humboldt two side by side, 50 foot wide zone lots across the street from the Humboldt Street Landmark District.'",
        "'speaker_5': '54 units in each building, a total of 108 with the restaurant five stories over 60 feet in height, and are a projection of 60% of the tenants owning an automobile. Zero parking spaces provided. 31st in stout two zone lots separated by an alley, three and a half stories 54 total units zero parking spaces provided.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Located in a landmark district, neither neighborhood can absorb this kind of added on street parking demand. The street parking potato sack is full. There is no more room for more potatoes. And there are similar development efforts underway in Cherry Creek in South Pearl.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We discovered there are over 4200 parcels in Denver of this size, and although the exact number of zone lots has not been identified, the vast majority are eligible for this parking exemption and are found in nearly all council districts creating a citywide problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When the Humble Street Neighborhood Association and Curtis Park neighborhood neighbors directly impacted by this exemption realized the scale of the problem and the potential for excessive development of these lots. We undertook efforts for the moratorium being considered. Tonight, our group met with Council nine, Councilmember Albert Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He listened and took action sponsoring this moratorium bill. Thank you all for your understanding of the impact of these kind of projects in your district. Councilman Cashman, thank you for assisting in Albert's absence. I always enjoy communicating with you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And ditto for this time. And I know Albert is grateful for what you did. Now we are likely to hear opinion this evening about how affordable housing may benefit from this prison exemption. You are likely to hear opinion about how this parking exemption furthers the cause to take Denver to a city with less and less car ownership'",
        "'speaker_5': '. However, this moratorium is not about either of these very important issues Denver is facing. To me, these discussions are more suited to Denver's blueprint to efforts, and that is where a long term vision and solution can be created.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The problem of affordable housing and getting people to use car cars less will certainly not be solved by continuing this exemption, nor will they not be solved by passing this moratorium bill. This moratorium is simply a brief time out, time to allow a diverse citizen and professional group to explore with community planning and development, text amendment language'",
        "'speaker_5': 'preventing what community planning and development has described as the unintended consequences and excessive development resulting from the present parking exemption. I strongly urge you to pass this moratorium bill so the task force can be established and get on with its work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Hickman. Margie Valdez.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Council President Brooks, I'm very glad to see you back. My name is Margie Valdez. I live at 2000 East 12th Avenue, Denver, Colorado, and I'm here in support of the moratorium. I am the chair of the Agency Zoning and Planning Committee, and the IMC, Zoning and Planning Planning Committee urges the Denver Community Planning and Development'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Department and the City Council to support a moratorium on applying Section ten .4.5.1 per in a the Denver Zoning Code to the issuance of zoning building permits for development of apartments on small lots 60 to 50 square feet or less unless adequate parking is provided.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Such developments can put extreme parking pressures on surrounding neighbors and businesses. This is a motion that was passed by both the Sapp committee. The Zoning and Planning Committee went to our delegates and it was enthusiastically supported by the ANC delegates.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm very proud to be presenting the motion tonight and thank both President Bush, Brooks and Councilman Cashman for their support in furthering this. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Valdez. Doug Gregg.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. Wish Council President a best to health. I just want to make three quick statements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Introduce yourself. First.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh, Doug. Greg, Greg. I live at 1901, East 13th Avenue, apartment one H at the corner of 13th and High. Thank you. I'm proud. 40 year old resident of Capitol Hill. South Capitol Hill. And that's very point. We already are so overwhelmed with cars.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We should be sitting here tonight talking about building parking spots. To take care of the crisis and to build a building with no parking spots is pure insanity. This is a theoretical question, and I don't expect any of you up there to answer your raise your hands.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But some of you have children and one of you and two of you might even have grandchildren. And the American dream is still to have a car. And you go ask your children or grandchild if they don't want to have a car.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they are going to say, sure, sure they do. We might have a few enlightened, educated people that dream of the future of a car society. We're not we're not going to see it in our lifetimes. So we have to plan accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. If I had.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Any time left, I'll give it yield like they do in Congress to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of these.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Fine people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can't do that. But I appreciate that thought. Craig Vandalia. Good evening. My name is Craig Vander and 1621 Humboldt Street. President Brooks, Councilman Cashman and the rest of the City Council. We thank you very much for taking up this moratorium Bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I speak in favor of it. Many of you probably watched the Olympics recently, and you know that in a lot of team sports, they're able to call a timeout at a very critical moment. You know, could be in the Super Bowl with 2 minutes left or in a volleyball match.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's very prudent and strategically wise on the part of the city council to take this moratorium bill, to take a time out and study this really important issue that has a significant impact on the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we applaud your efforts on this matter and appreciate your consideration of the moratorium. Thank you again. Thank you. Davydenko can. Thank you, Councilman Brooks, and thanks to all of you again. We've gone through this drill maybe four times in the last, whatever, 13 years of our.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Neighborhood association and always are grateful to live in a city where we have a city council that's so accessible and so open to really hear the full and objective.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Story of what we're experiencing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At the neighborhood level. My job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here is to just give you a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Super quick review of the progress.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We made in the course of not only meeting with each of you, but also meeting and winning support from a number.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of neighborhood organizations citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Curtis Park neighbors helped initiate the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'On.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The 2nd of May. They voted 10 to 1 to endorse the moratorium bill Humboldt Street Neighborhood Association working with them. By April 29th, we had had a vote of our executive committee and unanimously in support. Uptown Urban Design Forum.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dr. Branigan's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Outfit had a vote that was unanimous.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In support, and they.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Represented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At that meeting six neighborhood organizations in the hospital zone area, particularly surrounding it.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Kaiser St Joseph's, Presbyterian, St Luke's and Children's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Important was Al.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Davis. The representative from Saint Joseph's noted how important the renewal of the 17th Avenue business strip has become to the hospitals. It's seen as an amenity for their patients, families and friends and clients coming in there, and it's already overloaded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Parking is already difficult to find and it's our blocks. We're in the next block south, not our block. Franklin Street, Lafayette is to come and Gilpin and East are already serving as the overflow for those areas. So there's simply no room for around the clock.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Addition of dozens.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of new cars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Cherry Creek North Neighborhood Association at their main meeting voted the board voted unanimously in support of the moratorium. We'd like to thank Councilman Brooks, who helped us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Initiate the vote at the Inter Neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cooperation that Ms.. Valdes just told you about. Capitol Hill. United Neighborhoods voted 9 to 5 at their June 1st meeting and support West Washington Park Neighborhood Association on their own brought this to their board without us even asking them and got a 13 to 0 support for the moratorium bill.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I also went out and spoke to a bunch of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The RINO's and also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Within the neighborhood. The are.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'A very positive feedback.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Councilman Brooks and Councilman Cashman, fellow publisher. If as co-publisher of Life on Capitol Hill and Neighborhood Life for 21 years I observed in our papers covered.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lot of the changes, the ebb and flow of development that came into the neighborhoods of central Denver. What is currently happening, I believe, is a perfect storm that most of the general public and many in government failed to see coming.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The adoption of a form based zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The surge of popularity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of Denver as the place to live. The trend of worshiping at the altar of density and the trend of micro-housing. All four of these items.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The result.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe, is neighborhoods that can instantly double in population density, neighbors that have no influence on what is constructed in their.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Midst and the decrease of the quality of life. Developers are smart.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They are exploiting the unintended consequence of small art development with the use of micro-housing and the city's worship of density. This trend will kill the goose that laid the golden egg, which is the charm and beauty of Denver neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Housing that is close, but not too close. Tree lawns. Tree canopies. A variety of architectural styles. Buildings that are in proportion with landscaping setbacks. Pleasing relationships to their neighboring buildings. What are we getting today? I believe is massive high density development in a monotonous.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Prison like architectural style.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Driven by developers exploiting every possible inch of their.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Property, whether a row of townhomes, full city block.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Apartments or migrant unit cram and jam projects. The designs are efficient. Boring, repetitive and ugly. It maximizes profit, minimizes expense, and is devoid of elegance and charm and style. I'm not anti-development, though. I really am not. But I am anti.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Poor quality.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Development and I believe this is the legacy of what's happening. In the current development trends. We are a city of Fisher and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fisher and William.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lang and the bishops and many other talented.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Architects of the last century.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They produced elegant apartment buildings. Grand homes, small, charming bungalows, medium sized apartment buildings from the twenties and the thirties and forties. A city at that time encourage the building of something worthy, substantial, elegant and in proportion. And now I feel the city encourages development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Period. The build, build, build, get as much in as can cram as possible. If it fits the form, it gets approved, even if it overwhelms its neighbors and hurts the eyes. Looking for more visionary development encouragement. Thank you, gentlemen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Waters. Please. Please call your pa so we can get through the last two. Frank like to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Good to see you. My name is Frank Logan. Tory. I am a resident of City Park West. I live at the corner of 16th Avenue and Gaylord. And I'll. I'll make a left turn here, and I'm opposing this idea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How to say this is that, for example, I live in City Park. I chose to live in City Park West because of exactly the things that McWhorter said. Couldn't have said it better. It's a beautiful area. It Denver is beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am so lucky to live in Denver. I'm so lucky to live in City Park West in these neighborhoods. I would like it if other people were as lucky as I was as I am to be able to live in this neighborhood because I can walk to pretty much everything that I want or need except for perhaps'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the mountains. And so I can access things because of the way that the community was developed. Now. The community was developed quite a long time ago. I live in a house that was built over 100 years ago. And if if I want more people to be as lucky as I am, there needs to be more housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The crisis that I feel that we're facing isn't one of parking. The crisis that I feel that we're facing is one of a lack of housing. We we've the council has talked about that a long time. Neighborhood associations have been talking about that for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need more affordable housing. And one of the ways that we can have affordable housing is by building more units. And while I do sympathize with the ugliness of some development projects, I also feel that that's also in the eye.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One, it's in the eye of the beholder. And too, it's a luxury that I don't know we can afford right now. We need if if the stats are correct. In an article that I read today, 20 people are moving into Denver every day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So multiply that by 30 days in a month. That's 600 people that are moving into the city. Are we building 600 housing units in Denver each month? If we're not, then the prices continue to go up. And it makes it more difficult for people to live in the awesome neighborhood that I live in right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if we're making it more difficult for people to live in the neighborhood that I live in right now, that means they're going to be living further from the city core. They're going to be driving. They're going to need cars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They don't need cars. They can be car light and live in the city, work in the hospital district. You know, without the cars we get what we build for. If we build parking spaces, we get cars and we force people to be able to drive places or force them to purchase cars that they don't want, don't need'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or they can't afford. So I want you to sit when you're asking the question about do we have adequate parking? I want you to ask me to do we have adequate housing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we we got a better spelling on your name now. Is it Joann? Burritos. Plus. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll help you with that. Okay. Hi. Good evening, City Council. And good evening, fellow residents. My name is John Barrios. I didn't expect you to know that, but it's okay. You can call me Joe. That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, no, no. No worries. So I'm a parker. I live in a two car household. I also live in Uptown on 19th and Logan and I work in Centennial and my partner works in Idaho Springs. So we don't really have a choice.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We need our cards really badly. So you would think that I'm here to support the moratorium, but I'm not because. We have to make a tough choice in my household, similar to the choice that you guys have to make.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. You're trying to represent the interests of everyone. And I'll tell you a little bit about what's going on in my house. We work really far away, but we're also expecting our first baby. And so seven months doesn't seem like a long time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But in six months, two big things are happening in our house. We're having a baby and our lease is up. And we really love our town. We were both elected members of the board. We've gotten really familiar with our neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We love it there and we want to raise our baby there. But in six months, when our leases up, we're going to be priced out of a unit that we moved into two years ago. So now we have to choose.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do we support parking or we do we support the ability to live in our neighborhood in six months. And I can tell you that choice is really clear for us. I am unfortunately having one of those pregnancies where I'm like nauseous all day long.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And when I come home from work at like 6 p.m. and I have to drive around the block four times just to get a spot. I hate the world. It makes me crazy. It drives me nuts. I hate it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I need a place to live in six months. And I love my neighborhood. So seven months. Oh, it's no big deal. It's just a short time out and parking. Yes, we have a parking problem. Yes, we have a parking problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we have a housing problem. So think of the families that live in these neighborhoods. Think of, you know, my partner's wildland firefighter. I'm a civil servant. We don't have a lot of flexible income. The baby's going to eat up all of that extra housing income we were counting on when the lease was up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So just a different perspective. We hope we get to stay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And thank you to all our speakers. This concludes our speakers questions for members of council. Seeing no questions. I'm actually going to ask a question of Kyle Dalton. He's with community planning and development. Kyle, do you do you have the pending?'",
        "'speaker_0': '6250. Square lot. Parking exemption list. I do, yes. Great. I just wanted to I wanted you to just make sure you read that, because obviously in this bill, the pending applications who have gone through concept review are permitted to go through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just wanted you to read those in their locations. Sure. To the record. For the record, I'm Kyle Dalton, principal city planner at the Department of Community Planning and Development. So our records show, to the best of our knowledge, we have 11 projects that would meet the test in the bill as drafted in terms of having'",
        "'speaker_0': 'submitted a complete application for concept review. They are the two that have been mentioned a couple of times here at 16th and Humboldt. There are two located at 3148 Stout and 3121 Downing. Sure there's one at 1411 South Pearl, one at 1193, South Pennsylvania, there's one at 38, 15 Jason Street, there's one at 135.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Adams Street, 2420 Welton Street. 3022 Zuni Street. And 660 Logan Street. Thank you. Councilwoman each.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And this question may be for you or for the staff, but can you we just I think it's always helpful to clarify expectations. So there's going to be a process. You're going to have diverse opinions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is it your expectation that this group will work on consensus model to make recommendation or that they will debate things and may or may not all agree, but they will make their best, you know, input to you and to the city staff as and that the decision making will kind of lie after or outside the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just thought it'd be good to clarify, you know, whether and what the expectations are, because I think that this is an important time out. But I wanted to get a sense of, you know, what the input level is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Kyle, I think from a process perspective, I think you should talk about it. But, but I want to mention this as far as the people who are going to the stakeholders who are going to be on their council, Councilman Cashman and myself will be looking at a diverse set of stakeholders from folks who are in the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'community, folks who are actually affected by this. We're going to be looking at architects. We're going to be looking at actual developers. We're gonna look at an affordable housing expert. We're going to be looking at a TOD manager.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to look at a lot of different experts at the table along with these community representatives. And then we're going to I think you said it best. We will look at a consensus model. But the way that CPD has outlined this process, I think we're going to start to form some contextual agreements around some of these'",
        "'speaker_0': 'different zone districts and what this kind of looks like. But Kyle wanted you to speak because you've you have run many of these and have suggested some an area for us to go in on this. So go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thanks. Given that so much work was done by Councilwoman Mara before she departed off the office last year, we have a lot of background work that's already been done in terms of looking at other cities, acquiring the data here in Denver, understanding the history.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilman Cashman did a good job of explaining a lot of what happened so we can hit the ground running. As soon as if this bill were to pass and sign into law, we could start right away with the sponsors to form that stakeholder committee and work over the next couple of months or so to hopefully, you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'know, help those folks get to consensus about a recommended change to the code, which we would then propose be included within the bundle, the text amendments that the department does about once a year, cleaning up and clarifying the code so that we might bring it through with you on that same adoption process and and get it done'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the time afforded by the moratorium. Yeah, but I think that's a good expectation because I have heard from some folks saying, you know, will there be 20, 30 folks on the committee? And we probably wouldn't get a lot done with that many folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we're looking at about 12 to 15 would a significant amount of folks from the community and making sure we have those experts as well who are coming in and more of a neutral position saying, hey, here is here's the expertize from the field.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think that's important for folks to realize. Thank you. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Real quick follow up, Mr. President. What happens if the group does not reach consensus? What's the what's the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I mean, a council can meet in these questions. I'd tell you. I believe we will reach consensus. I think I'm in three or four of these issues right now currently and very tough issues that have reached consensus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if we don't, we will have to come back here and extend the moratorium. Yeah. Councilman Espinosa. Mr.. Looking like a question for you. Right, Frank. So for the last six years, this exemption has been in place and in the area of your bid.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been in place even longer. Why do you why do you think it hasn't solved the housing problem during this building boom? And shouldn't it be reconsidered to possibly better address the needs that you just identified?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you repeat? I'm afraid that you're asking a question that's way out of my pay grade. But can you repeat it again?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So this this this exemption actually started on Colfax in the Main Street Zone District. So it's been in place even longer for your area that you represent is a bit longer than it's been citywide in the unintended consequences really extend citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so during this extreme building boom that we've had over the last five years, we still have a dearth of affordable housing. So your statements were that this is somehow going to solve that problem when it hasn't over the last five years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what do you think? Why do you think that? And don't you think we should actually spend the time to try and figure out how we might address the needs on these small lots with some with moratorium and some reconsideration?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Yeah. First of all, clarify that, you know, I am speaking on behalf of me as a person and not as the Business Improvement District on Colfax. Second, I don't think that there is a real simple solution to the affordable housing issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Otherwise it would have been solved. And you know, you all are going through that. And, you know, there's impact fees and those property fees that, you know, may be assessed to folks. And I think that's a piece of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The perspective that I was bringing to it was more that just kind of like the simple supply and demand. And again, I don't mean that this isn't that this is the solution, but when and and I also don't mean to infer that the the one the development that's closest to me is at 16th and Humboldt, that's market'",
        "'speaker_3': 'rate. You know, there are some could say they're kind of expensive for the amount of square feet that you get, but it's adding 108 units into the supply. And so if parking is being required for that, then there's a cost to a parking spot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that parking the cost of that parking spot is going to erase some level of housing, some some place where somebody can sleep. The more that the more that the number of parking spots are required, the more places that somebody can sleep are going to be diminished.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So from for my perspective, the more that we are prioritizing parking over people, the more that we get into the situation where we have a shortage of housing and we should be doing what we can to increase housing supply within reason.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because if that was to go live at 16th and Humboldt, then that means that perhaps some of the old, you know, Victorian homes that have been converted into five units, five apartment units now that are commanding a thousand bucks a month that really aren't worth a thousand bucks a month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe, though, the prices of those are going to go down by a couple of hundred bucks of months, and then that starts making it a little bit more affordable. So this is these are all the moving parts where I don't think that there is a silver bullet, clearly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Just out of curiosity, I in one of my ongoing frustrations is in areas of 2D. And this is relative to what you're just seeing. We have considerably massive zone districts, but there's no development requirement that you build the number of units to address the housing need can actually underbid.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you feel that we should actually have a minimum requirement in certain residential zoned districts around at0d or mixed use? Yeah. All right. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I have a couple of questions. The first one is for those of you on council who have these units being proposed within your district. Is there an average square footage size for the micro units that are part of the applications that are moving through the process?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I don't have. Maybe one of the community advocates has the actual size for the d d line.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whoever has that information, I we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The need to put.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some sort of make up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nick Barnhart, 3117 South Street, the ones that are proposed in Curtis Park, or approximately 320 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And are they just one bedroom?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think they're more like studio studios.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Obviously. Okay. So that sort of gets it kind of a concern that we're not talking about family housing. When we are talking about these micro units, it's barely enough for one person, let alone a family, to live there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My next question is to Kyle, if you wouldn't mind coming back to the microphone. Is KPD planning to handle this internally or is this something that is going to be contracted out where we will have a contract having to come before council for a different entity that will administer the process that was just talked about earlier to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'kind of move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. So so first of your previous question, I'll just note some of these projects don't even have a residential component or are five, six, seven units, so they're not all micro-housing projects, although some are. To your question to me, we will not be contracting this out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll be managing this together with like with the council sponsorship.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in some of these developments that were talked about earlier, whether it's the one on Humboldt or on Stout Street, you mentioned some of the addresses. So you're saying some of these will have commercial that will not have any parking requirements as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they're not all just residential, they're mixed use developments, correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some are only residential. Well, one is only commercial. It's an office building and the rest are mixed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So the fact that any of the buildings will have commercial uses, I think could further exacerbate some of the parking problems in the neighborhoods. Thank you for the questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, are there any more questions? Seeing none. Public hearing of Council Bill 498 is now close. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll repeat that. Thank you, Mr. President. A very interesting discussion. You know, we're on we're on this cusp of a world with no parking. I think that cusp is a lot wider than some people do. You know, we were at the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A number of us were at the National League of Cities Conference in Nashville a couple of years ago. And there are folks they tend to be younger that they believe were were with driverless cars in widespread use in five years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And why do you need parking spaces? Because you don't need to own cars. I don't think we're there yet. I think we still need to make reasonable accommodation for automobiles. I think this moratorium is essential because this is a complex discussion and I don't want to encourage auto ownership, but I certainly don't want to encourage over 100'",
        "'speaker_5': 'units on one block with no parking. That's what I'm trying to stop here. That's my personal view of things. You know, we can talk about reasonable, reasonable reductions and reasonable numbers to try to reach a middle ground. But to do nothing makes no sense to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And can we get serious here? 320 square feet. For a residence now that's going on today and widespread use. But there's a lot of things that go on today that aren't going to be going on in five years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When when, when trends change and housing desires change and the economy changes. And I couldn't agree more with Councilwoman Ortega. And I know Brother Lopez talks about this all the time. We need housing for families in this city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is a dire need not just for for many housing, but a dire need for two, three and four bedroom affordable units. And we need to solve that as well. So while we're talking about these this parking exemption, do we require since people there's no evidence that I've seen that people in Denver are giving up their cars'",
        "'speaker_5': '? I just haven't seen that. So do we. Somehow I don't even know if it's legal or possible. Require if you're going to take a parking exemption that you can only rent or sell to people who somehow prove they have no motor vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, there's got to be some sort of logic to what we're doing. I also want to commend my my good friend Hillary Waters for her comments on the architecture. As Hillary said, she published life on Capitol Hill for a couple of decades while publish the Washington Park paper.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Hillary has been a warrior for her community for a lot of years. And that that whole idea about what are we doing, what do we want Denver to look like? Do we really want it to look like these mini boxes that are going up?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just spent six days in Connecticut last week and I'm looking at architecture from the 1600s and 1700s. Now there's newer buildings and they don't look exactly like the older buildings, but they sure aren't building square boxes. They're making a real effort to establish character of their community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think we better get back to that real soon, or I think we're going to be making a whole lot of mistakes along the way. And I want to end my comments with a philosophical question that I keep answering, and I haven't heard a real discussion of it yet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is what do we want Denver to be do right now? Last I heard, we were at 700 or 682,000. We'll be at 700,000 people soon. We were like at 500,000, one decade, 500,000, another decade, 500,000, another decade.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of a sudden, we're at 682,000. So what's Denver's ultimate population? Is it 900,000 or is it 4 million? I mean, I know it takes a crystal ball, but I think that discussion is critical to discussions like we're having now, because if we decide it's 4 million, we better start mowing down our Victorians and build more of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'these boxes because we're not going to have enough room. But if we decide that character and architecture is important, and if we decide that there is limits to density, then I think it's a different discussion. And one last thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was involved in an Urban Land Institute process recently at the University of Denver, and it was around this new strategic plan. There was a gal from Indianapolis there, and I said to her, I said, Well, how's things going in Indianapolis?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And she said, You know, as a very bright woman, she said, there's something very appealing about being a second tier city. You know, now that's a community discussion. Do we want to become. The zenith of all modern cities and cutting edge?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or is there a middle ground? Because if if we want to keep building, I hate to tell you, but there's counties all around us that have far more ground and they're going to build bigger than we are now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are cities within an hour's drive. There's counties within an hour, an hour and a half that can start now with endless land, build a first rate, modern day transportation system to move their people around with subways and bridges and whatever else they decide they need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we need to really understand or discuss as a city what it is we want to be. So that's getting a little bit off track, Mr. President. So I'll end there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa. Thank you for those off track comments. Councilman Cashman. We couldn't agree with the majority of them more. The. The the only clarification that I wanted to make was for my constituents in northwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When this bill first came, the draft ordinance came to my desk. It actually didn't include the lion's share of these parcels in northwest Denver because it was geared not towards the urban context, even though it was intended for all mixed use zoned districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It did not mean not that urban. Yeah, the Yukon context. So I did make my comments to the groups that were supporting this in order to make sure that those parcels that are subject to this sort of overdevelopment in traditionally lower density neighborhoods did not get impacted and without sort of a better process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is sort of a direct reflection of the fact that while this was originally drafted towards the Colfax corridor 32nd and Lowell, not the Colfax corridor, as much as some people may want it. So I just wanted to make it very clear to my constituents in District one that I did, in fact, do what I could to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'advocate that this get extended and meet the true intent that I believe was always part of the original drafting. And so I'm happy to support it because it does include the lion's share of these all these parcels in District one things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, sir. We've had this discussion quite a bit about the small apartments. And even in Cherry Creek, we had a really strong discussion with a developer about one of the applications to be approved tonight. That apartment went up from 320 to 375 square feet, a huge jump.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. So it's pretty small. And parking was an issue and there was a good discussion about a compromise that could actually help parking as well as help the developer. So I think it's very important that we take this time out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And also all the discussion we've had, whether it's in any type of residential, a commercial zoning or even this small light zoning, it's all about transit. Where is transit? We got to people don't need cars if we have a good transit system.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I hear from from public works is still going to be five or six years away before we have our first transit implementation. So. So we we got a lot of time and there's nothing wrong with taking a time out to study this and think further and actually have a better feel for our transportation system as that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'planning goes forward. So I'll support this moratorium and I recommend my colleagues support it also. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. New Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to speak in support of this moratorium as well. Several years ago, the National League of Cities hosted a meeting in Seattle, and we had some some folks who went. We also had a follow up meeting later with the Denver Partnership and several members of city council, some of whom are no longer'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on this body. They've been term limited, but we had an opportunity to go see some of the micro units in Seattle that were being built by more than one developer. And. What they said to us before we went to tour the sites was that the people who lived there didn't have cars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we actually got a chance to meet the residents that lived in a couple of the developments that we saw. One building was a five story building, had, I think, 36 units. They were on single family residential blocks and they didn't have any parking, very similar to what we're dealing with here today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we learned that they do have cars. They were challenged to find a place to park. The neighbors who lived on the block really didn't want them parking on their block. And so it created a problem. And their city council was supposed to be dealing with that very topic during the time that we were there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I understand they delayed it and still haven't found the right solution to addressing that problem. But they're struggling with the same issues that have begun to come up here with some of the projects that are having a large number of units on single family residential blocks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We worked really hard on the Blueprint Denver plan that identified where the city wanted to see growth happen, and it was on the commercial corridors and at the TOD sites and we're seeing that happen all over the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in fact, this body has been involved in many rezonings that has encouraged development and, you know, approved the high density that will be going in at a number of transit stops across the city. So that's where it was designed in Blueprint Denver to direct that development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what we're seeing happen is. Neighborhoods that have been traditional single family neighborhoods where Blueprint said protect the stable neighborhoods and target the growth to these other areas to the edges of neighborhoods. But we're seeing the internal fabric of many of our neighborhoods changing drastically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, you may have one or two developers that in some areas like. Around the Tennyson Street corridor, for example, where some blocks have been completely changed and replaced with duplexes that take up the entire lot. And the older, you know, some in some cases, historic buildings are gone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in that neighborhood, I've been to a number of meetings of the Berkeley Neighborhood Association. The biggest topic that comes up over and over is the issue of parking. I've had many calls from the Curtis Park neighborhood about this same very topic way before we even proposed this moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is an issue that I think is important for us to take this time out, figure out what are the right solutions so that we can be able to create that balance. Micro units are not the answer for family housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know that. And what we learned when we did the trip to Seattle was. Some of those units were 200 square feet. And they were renting them for $700 a month. Now, I've heard that some of the units that we're talking about here are in the ballpark of $1,000 a month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, are they are they truly affordable? It they're at a price point that's not available in our market today. Right. Because our prices of housing have gone up drastically. But, you know, I think they are one part of the solution of housing needs in this city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're not the answer to all of our housing needs. And I think there is a place for them to go. But we also have to create that balance, because we know the people in Denver still drive their cars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Even with the build out of our transit system, many people still drive their cars. And so we have to create that balance. And I think having this timeout to allow us to do that is going to be an important measure that will allow us to find those right solutions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Counsel. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to start by saying that I'm very supportive of this amendment, and I hope that we will move this forward tonight. And I want to thank my colleagues and the members of the public who worked to bring this forward and push on this these projects.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is being proposed to be built was never the intent of this ordinance. This is a loophole. This is a workaround in my mind, a way of cheating and finding a place to build something. That was not our intent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And many of us asserted that maybe this is a good thing for Denver and a way for us to deal with affordable housing and create more housing stock. Well, if this is good for Denver, then we should go in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Eyes wide open. We should go in intentionally saying we're going to carve out a parking moratorium for this. And that's not what we did. We didn't put this in place for this use and people found a way to use it in that manner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And on that alone, we should put a moratorium on and stop this until the point at which we decide that this is what we want for our city. Tonight, I drove my car here to city council for the first time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's the first time in three weeks that my parking spot had a car in it, not a bike, or I didn't drive by the train. And with the growth that we are experiencing as a city, we cannot build enough parking or enough new lanes for everyone to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we a single occupancy vehicle in their car. We need to create real options for mobility. We need to create infrastructure that gives all of our residents the freedom of choice when it comes to mobility so that they can choose to get around however they want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only way that we will ever be able to accommodate this kind of growth. This is not the answer to that. Letting these projects go through on these lots to give you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Picture of this for people who might be watching or here for one of the other hearings and wondering what's going on here. I grew up on a 50 foot lot and we really packed it in as a family of seven, one of five kids, and we never had seven drivers in our household at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yet we were a parking menace on our block and right next door to us on the next lot over that wasn't even 50 feet was a single gentleman with a two car garage and a carport. So he didn't even need the parking in front of his house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we were still all over that block. Seven people on a 50 foot lot. Some of the projects that we have talked about tonight, 54. And that's not members of the same family with some people who are little kids being carted around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's 54 individual households. And right next door to it, another 54. Pearl Street is in the district that I represent, and it is one of those magical places that represents everything that whether we planned on it or it just happened, really went right in our city and created communities where people want to live in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People want to live in our urban core because it is walkable and it is bikeable. And you can get to the train and you have all these great small local businesses. What this parking exemption was created to promote and now it's all at risk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of these projects is on that strip of Pearl Street, 17 units. 17 people on a place where we already are stretched for parking, where these small local businesses run the risk of being choked out, where residents can't find a place to park when they're getting home from wherever they're going or have any guests over at night'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who can park anywhere close to their house. And in a place where. Urban living is embrace. And we have huge urban infill opportunities at the former Gates site and the Broadway marketplace, where we have residents saying, yes, bring density on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here's a place where we can build that missing housing stock. Here's a place by transit where that makes sense. And instead, what we're getting is 17 units. On Pearl Street with no requirement to build parking. Even if for a second I can see that the people living there are able to use the train or a bike or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bicycle or car to go, to get to work, to get to the grocery store, to get to all of the troops that they make every day. 17 people, and none of them are going to keep a car so that they can go skiing because we don't have an option to get from the city to skiing.'",
        "'speaker_3': '17 people who are all new to Denver, 40 new people a day in metro Denver. None of them want a car so that they can go home for Thanksgiving dinner to spend it with their family. And they only hang out with other people who also don't have a car and don't ski and don't want to go home'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for Thanksgiving dinner because there will be no place for their guests to park either. I don't believe it. I don't buy it. And I think that what's at risk here, because this is one project on Pearl Street when there are entire blocks, the entirety of Pearl Street, that could be one after another.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What's at risk? What we could lose here is far too great to even take a chance on. And I frankly think that it is irresponsible for those who are building these kind of projects when that exemption was never intended for this and is something that that puts so much at risk for so many to even be considering'",
        "'speaker_3': 'these projects. So I personally wish we could have tightened up the pipeline more aggressively and said, no, this is not what we intended here. And so you don't get to do it until we take a timeout. And I really hope that we will come out of this moratorium period with something that respects the fabric, fabric of our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'communities and gets this type of development under control. You know, if we're going to really look at this and there are really developers who say, yeah, I know these people aren't going to hit cars and they don't have friends who need cars and they don't want to go skiing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then why don't they come to the table with when you rent here, you get an eco pass, you get a bicycle membership, you get a car to go membership. Oh, and by the way, we'll do residential parking permits on this street and ten blocks in any direction that my people won't be able to get.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because if you really believe in it, then that's the kind of proposal that we should see, a proposal that makes sure not promises what could be with this thing that we've never done but says no, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will not make any sense for someone. Someone will be unable to advocate my development and I'm still willing to put my capital on the line because I think I can rent it out. What's happening is we are all paying for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's been being sold to us. And I don't I don't buy it. I don't believe it. I hope that we'll pass this unanimously tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Greenwich.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to start by saying that I, too, plan to vote for this piece of legislation tonight and to thank the sponsors for their work on it and the department. But I think that, you know, we speak from the dais not just to explain our vote, but also to, I think, enhance and take'",
        "'speaker_6': 'dialogs to the next level. So I think it's important just to share some cautions or some counterpoints to some of the dialog that we've had up here tonight. I think that my colleague, Councilman Cashman in particular, is right in saying that our infrastructure and our our our land use might be a little bit ahead of our transportation'",
        "'speaker_6': 'choices and our mobility. Right. So that is a real observation. And it is true we don't have as much high frequency bus service as we need. For example, rail is great, but it's very expensive and difficult to implement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So our next generation is going to be higher frequency bus, more affordable fares, whatever the different options need to be. So. So that is a significant point and I think one that this council has recognized. And it's why we are not just debating these land use pieces, but talking a lot about the infrastructure spending to fund and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'expand the choices that Councilman Clark mentioned. But I do just want to, you know, clarify, I think what I think are a few misnomers. Though there are choices today. It's not that there are no choices. The busting is see that service to the mountains?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's running today. It's ahead of projection. You can actually take a bus to the mountains. So let's make sure that everyone knows that, right? Let's talk about it more. They're in the process of expanding the frequency of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there's more trips right up to the mountains and back. But you actually can take a bus to ski in Colorado. And we've had that service for less than a year. So it's not everyone knows about it yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But but but I think we have a responsibility to educate that these choices are coming. And it's not that our land use discussions shouldn't be contemplating them and or even responding to them. I want to talk a little bit about this idea that, you know, that we can somehow, you know, kind of limit our share of the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'growth in that our neighbors, you know, around us will be able to absorb it all. You know, we have an urban growth boundary in the entire metro region. So there is a voluntary agreement that all of the counties in the metro area have made and said, you know what, we can't sprawl in every square inch of green'",
        "'speaker_6': 'space. Why can't we? Well, first of all, because just like folks talked about the golden goose, our golden goose is really open space and mountain views and all of that. And if we build in every available space in this region outside of Denver, then the thing that made many of us love living here is diminished, too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we as a region have actually said no. The other reason we don't want to sprawl into every piece of open space is because it's expensive. We do modeling. I'm our representative on the Denver Regional Council of Governments and we model different development scenarios and the infrastructure cost to build those new roads that some folks were describing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and to build the water. Water is a huge issue in this region. It's not there. And so our neighbors are having the same conversation we are now. They may not have a downtown Denver or a tech center with 20 storey high rises, but they're debating townhomes where they used to only have single family homes or they're debating'",
        "'speaker_6': 'three and five story where they only had one story commercial. They are having the same conversation about growing up and growing smarter that we are. So so I think that the idea that we can just kind of, you know, continue our trend of planning for the single car and that, you know, some of this growth will go'",
        "'speaker_6': 'elsewhere. I don't think that's a realistic scenario. There is a desire people have to live in this city and with the amenities that we have. And that's a credit to both the character as well as some of the investments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. It's both of those things. So so here's my my fear. Here's my caution, I guess, about this moratorium, which is that I will disclose I'm a returning member of council. So I had a chance to talk with Councilwoman Robb when she thought about writing an amendment, and she did have a very good compromise.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The compromise included some projects not having any parking and then it included other projects with more units or different kinds of units having some parking, but maybe not the same amount that they would have in some other zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was a true compromise. It didn't have always parking 17 units next to a transit station might not need parking. There are other options. Travel, demand, management. I agree with Councilman Clark. This is the concept where you say to someone, if you want the privilege of building this way, then do a written plan on how you are'",
        "'speaker_6': 'going to get these alternative modes. I hope this group discusses that. But but I think that, you know, I wanted to just ask the questions I did of of the sponsor, because I think it's really important to say that this council reserves the right to broker a compromise if the community can't come, if someone joins this group'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with the perspective that we should never, ever build a building without parking. That to me is not paving a way towards compromise and might not be the right solution. I would not support that solution. So I am both asking the community who wants to be engaged in this dialog to be sincere about compromise and to ask my'",
        "'speaker_6': 'colleagues on this council to say, if that compromise can't come from the community, then it's important that we broker it here. Because I'm not okay saying, you know what, we should never build another building again in Denver without parking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's not the right answer. We have places, we have strategies and we have opportunities where we can do this. They're not all in place in all the neighborhoods where the zone district exists. We haven't done a great in advertising them, making them of, you know, accessible and affordable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have more work to do. And that is why I'm strongly in favor of this tonight, but with some caution and some thoughtfulness about the fact that we will continue heading in this direction as our partners in the region, as are other regions like ours, it is an urbanizing nation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so this is hard work and it requires an investment that we are going to have to be willing to make into that transportation infrastructure. So with that, I want to just say that I'm hopeful that the folks who enter into this really, truly are open to compromise in both directions, that there may be places and conditions'",
        "'speaker_6': 'where this is possible and there may be some. As we've heard, not every project we've talked only about residents tonight, but our planner told us many of these buildings are commercial or other uses. We need to be much broader in our thinking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've gotten very stuck on one story here tonight, and it's important to hear the other stories when we go through this process. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Can each. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. The beauty of going last is you really don't have much to ask because your colleagues are always so thoughtful and what they say. So I will certainly be brief. You know, the thing you always hear as an elected official is unintended consequences.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I, I, I understand how some colleagues are in support of this feel that. But I also share Councilwoman Kennedy is the unintended consequences of passing this bill, because I do think it's a little concerned because we do not want to say that we always want to have parking built with parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. No parking bill. I always have parking bill. Excuse me. So I think it's important that we say that. And what gives me comfort in this is that this is seven months. But I will certainly question if seven months from now another extension comes forward, because then I will certainly ask that question, what are we really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'trying to do here? So I'm comfortable moving this forward. But we we need to be cautious about the message that we're sending. And I encourage those in this group and I have all the faith in the world, in the leadership team that's moving forward, is that we do come to a better a better agreement than what we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'currently have. Because I do think Councilman Clark was quite on point when he says that so too that I'm comfortable comfortable with and Mr. Drag, I want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To say I have a 15 month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Old son. I do not believe he will ever have a driver's license. I don't I do not believe that. And I think technology is moving so fast, the world that he will live in will be ridiculously different from the one that I grew up in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's why I talk about being cautious, because I'm excited about the future and I think it will look very drastically different from what we have right now. But I am comfortable supporting this. So. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon, we will be following your son's career. Okay, Councilman. Just to that to that point real quick, it's really interesting. This week was released that Uber next year will be in some cities releasing and testing driverless cars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that is that's an interesting comment. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Councilman heard him now. And your son's about 16 years old. He's going to know your ear off so bad that you're going to want him just to go get a driver's license. Haven't even raised my sisters telling them that they can't have a license.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's almost like denying them water air. That's going to be very hard, but it is something that we have to consider and listening to everybody tonight and I do support the moratorium moving forward. I do think we need to look at this not just in terms of regional and how we're growing as a region, but in different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'parts of the city where it's appropriate that you'd be able to place units without having to build parking until the redistricting. Now, now that I think about it. I don't have one parking meter in my district. It's different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some areas are different. There's a lot of areas in my neck of the woods that I was born and raised in. There's plenty of parking. But there's not as much housing as we need. And so it is a balance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The West Line cuts right through Council District three. The light rail moving south goes through District three. It is something that we are constantly looking at and the more we add units, the more it becomes an issue. Here's the thing, though.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have to strike a balance with both of those features coexisting. I agree. It's never going to be a time where you're not going to see a vehicle in the street, not in our lifetime. And you said that eloquently.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I disagree with what Mario said. Because all is fine and dandy on a bike until you have a kid that's sick in the winter. Right. And if you're working class or or you're poor in this city, you're not going to call an Uber.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're going to jump in your car, beat up car, and. Cruise over to the hospital. Or to the pharmacy. That's just the reality of it. I think sometimes we become enamored with ourselves to the point that we forget that it's not just the creative class in the city, but it's also the maintainers of this city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's the people who are building the buildings. Right. Picking your plate up. Serving you. Building your roads. That's what Denver's for as well to. Denver is their home as well, too. It's not just it's all it's an end situation and we have to build for that end situation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You don't build just for what's popular and trendy now. Bicycles have always been part of them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would challenge folks especially to think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you look at connectivity, when you look at transportation in Denver, there are so many people who bike before it was popular because the only thing that they can afford, there are people who can't get licenses because of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their status as status issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Until you have immigration reform, until the clear up this backlog, they can't get behind a wheel. But they're on a bike and they're on it long before it's popular. You have day laborers cruising around central Denver on bikes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have homeless individuals trying to get to work on bikes. But when we're looking at building affordability and there has to be some kind of compromise. So that's why I do support the moratorium. As we are building those two and three bedroom units that we need so badly and desperately in the city, I be considering at least'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one spot. I mean, we shouldn't always do it and push all the density in areas where we don't have power or we don't have enough spaces. Right. So I do look at it as a two way street. I think it's a future for for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Denver as a city for everybody. Especially for those who maintain it. We don't want them to leave because Denver dies when that happens. So I support this. I look forward to hearing the discussions, participating in it and and coming into these chambers to actually lift the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you for your work. Thank you all for for being here tonight and your leadership. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, are there any other. Any other comments for members of council? I. I will close this out and make some some comments. One and I think this needs to be easily said more. The neighbors champion this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in a time where I'm hearing that neighbors aren't being heard at a time that I'm hearing that there's so much division in our city. The humble and courteous park neighbors came, sat down and met with me and had language that they put together for a moratorium and that needs to be celebrated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so a way to organize in a way to show that public engagement in this city works and it matters. So I really appreciate you all. Secondly, I think there's a lot of nervous folks around. You know, what is moratorium mean and and all of this language?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I was very clear at the beginning, and I think Councilman Cashman and I talked about this as well, is that, you know, we had this marijuana conversation about pending applications. And one of the reasons that we did not want to touch the pending is people had made sizable investments already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whether we agree with those investments or not to change the rules midstream, we felt like was unfair. So that was one of the reasons we did not include all of the pending. However, we believe going forward that this moratorium and this this time to bring in neighbors, to bring in experts and have thoughtful consideration about what we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'want the future of the city to look like is going to be incredibly impactful. And so we're excited to take this on. And I appreciate all of the folks who showed up here, even the people who did not talk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you put money in a meter and sat in those hard wooden benches. Thank you for being here. And I hope that this gives you some encouragement that this is your government and this is about inclusivity in this city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think this moratorium makes perfect sense. We're talking about a lot of things, but this is what it's saying. We're going to need someone to take a timeout. You know, I'm a sports guy taking a time out and bring in some of the best thinkers in the city to the table and saying, how do we do this'",
        "'speaker_0': '? Well. Hey, I want to also give it up to Councilwoman Robb. This is you know, it's fun to she she really was working on this on her last months of being on city council and this kind of left.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if you're watching this as part of your legacy and councilman cat councilman Catherine has just been great picking up the picking up this moratorium and working with neighbors. And so I really appreciate it. I want to say I am a when I first got elected city council, I actually sold my car for one year to really'",
        "'speaker_0': 'experience what it's like to be an urbanist in the city. And it was hard. It was very hard. I do have a car again, but I think this is a larger conversation about choices that we make in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do not want that to be lost on any of us. My neighbor is in we live two miles from downtown, 2.3 miles from downtown. And my neighbor has three cars. There's two people living in the house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not really an urbanist perspective of how to live. That's not really sustainable. And so there are some real choices that we as neighbors, as people, as constituents and people in this city have to think about how we are impacting the environment that we're living in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm excited to have that conversation as well. So obviously I will be supporting this and I'm excited to move forward and talk about the strides that we've made in seven months. So, Madam Secretary, Roll Call.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cashman I.'",

    "Moratorium on Garden Court Building Form in Denver Zoning Code.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved in second at the public hearing for 541 is open. May we have the overview accounts? A new share.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you could please be silent while you are exiting. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. This also is a second moratorium about an unintended consequences, about a garden caught building for form. And it's misuse right now. So let's look at why do we need this moratorium, just like we talked about the small court.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I believe I've always say this, you know, because the use of this form. But here's a garden court building form. A garden court building for them with no garden and no court. Just like a joke. And so I keep thinking that there's something wrong here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think we all recognize that. That we need to do something about this in the zoning code. There's a lot of language in there is very confusion, confusing. We see specific intent, but doesn't allow garden code form, but then we do allow it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we've got to straighten out the language. It really conflicts with neighborhood character. You know, we're talking about increasing density and I think we all know density is coming. But but when you look at the zoning code, again, it says there's no maximum of the number of units on a parcel.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we may be going a little too far. I think we need to have a little discussion about what what density means and and be able to make sure it doesn't affect existing neighborhood character and or quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I was glad to see that the community planning development, they recognized the unintended consequences of this and we need to review this. I don't think they intended to do this. The Zone didn't. It's one of those things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Too small. Too small. I know. We need to really take a time out and reevaluate. Okay. Go back to the next picture. This shows. You know, like the next back to the Garden Court. The other way. There. Go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One more. Here we go. This is the picture of this in the zoning code. You know, you think, well, this is you know, it's an old town, but looks like five units. But the main thing it shows it shows a central area that's a garden court.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And these can be very beautiful kind of arrangements. You've got instances of of units on to the guard court and some on the street, but you don't have a garage. But the main thing is you have a very defined garden court area that can have wonderful, beautiful landscaping and be a very beautiful, designed building for challenges we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'see with it in the existing zoning code. He says, you know, a minimum width of the garden court is 15 feet. It's like a large sidewalk. And so we'll show you some pictures in a minute of how it's been implemented.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was really just a lack of sufficient space for any kind of landscaping. It has very insufficient solar access and and permeable surfaces. And also, he talks about having three sides of a building facade and just sort of like that diagram, we had three different buildings around a garden court.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't see that being implemented as well. Also in some districts where the row house is is the zoning district is being used just as part of the garden court. We see there's a vertical overlap which is prohibited in the in the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You can't put a row house above a row house, there's no stacking allowed. And so it's not like some other building type, but and so you can't increase density but by doing stacking. And again, it's all about density affecting design.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Here's here's an example. In D.C. District nine, Councilman Brooks District shows a picture of a nice beach house intended as an older area. We see. But you see on the picture on the right, you see the garden caught in the middle and the units all around on three sides.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, here's one. Here's an example. It was being implemented. You can see where is the garden court? Where is the where is that area? Where are the three sides? All you see is is is apartments coming off of of a concrete sidewalk.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Nothing really attractive. No garden, no court. Here's another example of this was an incongruous park in my district as another example of the yield of a garden court project you see around a beautiful garden. Court is a nice oval, beautiful design and you know, not very high density, but you can easily see where it could be more'",
        "'speaker_8': 'dense. But the main thing, the design of the garden court is really beautiful and attractive and a real asset to that community. In the next one. Next one. Here's one in my district. When I first saw it, I thought it was a prison.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I looked at it and I said, Well, you know, the Department of Corrections is moving in. And so but this is a garden court for them. This is a 15 foot sidewalk down. It's not even 54 sidewalks, 15 feet from building the building and the sidewalk there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, no landscaping. You see a paper and you can see the interest. On the third side is really an entrance to the parking garage below. So we're just not implementing as it was intended. So the real confusion in the zoning code, we just need to be real clear about what the what the language should be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need to make sure that the language matches what we want to implement and encourage better development, better design. We know we'll have some greater density, but we've got to make sure that our language matches what what we want to be implemented.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Neighborhood character. You know, the mayor's talked in the city. This dress talked about beautiful neighborhoods. We have we do. We have gorgeous neighbors. I know I have one of those in District ten and we want to make sure they stay beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so we need to match character with density. Density is coming, but there has to be a balance. And balance is a key word. We've got to have smart development, recognizing the unique areas and the building forms we've got.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, and we really want a very attractive quality of life area in a courtyard. If we're going to have a car garden court building for let's do it right. Let's make it beautiful and attractive like it can be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's do surfaces that attract good landscaping unless we have real clarity in the zoning code. Shouldn't be any confusion when you read the zoning code is should tell you what to do. You should be real clear about what it's doing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so residents will have great predictability of what's going to happen in their neighborhoods. And also most important and really it needs to have a still a real greater community's sense of community with residents and developers. This garden court should be a real asset to the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right now. We've got we get we restarted the moratorium a couple of weeks ago. We had six applications in process in the first reading. Right now, three of them didn't proceed. You know, one of them was on Colorado Boulevard and our city council did not approve the zoning for it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was going to be a garden court and it was going to be like a, you know, the density. There was going to be twice as twice as much as what was allowed. And so our city council wisely rejected that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And two other applications on, say, Paul and Lawrence to decide they decided not to move forward. So right now, we just have we have three applications using the garden court to a marine concept review, which means the design review, and then one is in final review.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just to show you some pictures. These are the ones that were withdrawn, just three different areas. Let's go to the ones that are in the. And then was Dover proposing an exemption? These are going through concert reviews or I remember tonight we were talking about allowing anything is accepted into its concept review to be to be moved'",
        "'speaker_8': 'forward. And so that's what these three are. Boulevard One is a special good example where it has a 50 to 60 foot garden chord. It's very beautiful, all rowhouses houses. So that's a very good example. So I'm looking forward to this moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have this discussion. So the big areas of our mortuary we're talking about with, you know, Castle Espinosa that are sponsoring this, and Councilman Espinosa, being an architect is really being so critical to helping develop some of this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and the with his suggestion is the height of the building the tallest proposed building is the width of the garden quarry could be, you know, 30 to 35 feet stacking in the building in the zoning code. No.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If it's a real house form, no stack is allowed the bounding buildings. We need to really make sure if we gonna have three sided garden core designs. Let's make sure there are three sides in there, have buildings in dwelling units, and unless truly create something that should be a garden court buildings around dwelling units around a garden'",
        "'speaker_8': 'port. So again, we have three applications to be exempt and denied just because they are accepted into the concept review. And this is a 12 month moratorium, we want to make sure that this is get done. We want to bring a lot of participation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All residents, architects and our city council. Just like with this small lot, we want a lot of good cross-section of people to talk about this. And and we're we're lucky that Kyle Dalton and his team are going to lead this, and they're excited about tackling this evaluation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're looking forward to hopefully gaining support for this moratorium tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Newt, I understand you are making an amendment tonight. And so I want you to read that amendment into the record so that the folks who are commenting tonight can comment on the the amended bill, the amendment that you're about to make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And proceed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Most of the amendments tonight are just technical corrections. My speed is. And so the most important section is the section that allows those applications that are scheduled for concept review to be exempt from moratorium. So let me read the the changes to the the bill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd like to move to amend Council Bill 541 as amended on July 25th as follows. Number one on page two, lines 17. Strike the word courtyard and replace it with garden court. On page two, line 18, strike the word courtyard and replace it with garden court.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, number three, page two, line 18, insert the word tallest before the word proposed. On page two, lines 18 and 19, strike the words buildings abutting the garden court. Oh, he said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, just. I'm sorry. Just the overview. It's fine. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, gave you a preview. Anyway, they're just general changes, and that's what they mean. It's all about the main thing is this the section that allows the those three applications to be exempt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. We have 19 speakers tonight. And I'm going to call the first five speakers up to this first bench. So Robbie Hoban, George Mayo, Nathan Adams, Margie Valdez and Angela Steiner. Ravi. You'll be first. If you could make your way up, that'd be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, well, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen of the Denver City Denver City Council, for this opportunity to speak to you about garden variety.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you can, introduce yourself to you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sorry. My name is Robbie Hoban.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I live at 24th and Glenarm and one of the cute six that were built in 1885. And I'm kind of an unintentional resident of that area. I used to live at 14th and high in a high rise and loved it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when I broke my collarbone, I moved in with my then boyfriend, now husband, and thought, I never want to live here, but I ended up staying and I love it. We're so close to the library, the light rail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We walked for a not so safe way. I absolutely love living there. And some friends and I had been talking about a year and a half ago as we were starting to get concerned about the container buildings that were going in that didn't fit with the spirit of Curtis Park being over 100 years old.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've loved our neighborhood mostly, and I think mostly the thing that concerns me is it doesn't feel like so much of a residential neighborhood in some areas. We're in kind of an odd corner that got sliced by the Walton corridor, which we're happy to see go in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are a few garden court forms in our area that feel like a hug, just like you described. I didn't realize how much work you all had already done with this. So, you know, the garden court feels like this, but some of the ones that are going in now feel more like this, or maybe if I can'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do this this way or maybe this way or this way. So as you're walking along, Maggie and I call it we love our walkable and Taco Bell neighborhood, we feel. But with these kind of apartments, we can't even get the delivery of the Curtis Park newsletter into some of these new places, much less knock on the door'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and ask, Have you seen my cat, Dinah? Which is like Shannon, who lived across the street or my cat recently, who escaped. So we really do in Curtis Park in Five Points Need Eyes on the street, which make for a more safe neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you've been to our neighborhood at 24th and Glenarm, there's all kinds of folks who live in houses and not in houses. And many times we look out and see folks who need our help. And if you can't see the street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, you don't want to see the street, then you can't see people who need help. And that's what I love so much about our neighborhood, is that we can look out for each other right now, or at least we have been able to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I know that people can choose to live in high rise apartments. I chose to live in a high rise apartment and there's lots of places where you can do that all along. Welton and all over Denver. Really, honestly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm here to speak to you, to ask you for the time to reconsider what this actually looks like, what we intended in 2011 with the neighborhood plan. I figured it fits northeast or Northwest Denver plan. But this spirit that we intended with, Gordon, Kurt, and what's actually being kind of corrupted, the negative effects that have on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our streets. So please consider all of us who love living in a walkable, talk, able neighborhood, feel kind of neighborhood in the spirit that our neighborhood plan called for. And we are here to speak in favor of that moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Much. Thank you. All right. Nathan Adams.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, council members and President Brooks. My name is Nathan Adams from 2899 North Sphere Boulevard. I've been an active real estate broker and developer for the past 12 years. I've built several hundred homes, renovated hundreds of homes, and I've done all of this work by borrowing money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I work with investors, work with banks, and I say this as it's relevant. Developers are not an unlimited supply of money. I congratulate you on amending the bill so that the moratorium will include the people that are already in planning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's pretty catastrophic to be in planning to own your land, have hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, and to excuse me to simply not be able to go forward or to have the rules completely changed on you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That would be extremely difficult. I don't have a project that's at stake, so I'm speaking on behalf of those that. That's project. That's project maybe at issue. Also speaking towards the precedent that's set, I think it's a very dangerous precedent to change the rules and not allow the people that are already in planning to continue forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would even go so far as to encourage a 90 day period of time where those that have already purchased their land have the ability to still submit plans, still be able to come in under the existing rules.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That the change that's being made via an immediate moratorium sets a very dangerous precedent anti-business, anti-growth message. I ask that you please consider my suggestion for a delayed, effective date. As a small business owner that knows firsthand how devastating it can be to making changes to development projects with little or no notice.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is imperative that the City Council be considerate of small business owners and developers when considering changes to government regulation like the one proposed tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Margie Valdez.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, counsel, again. My name is Margie Valdez. I live at 2000 East 12th Avenue, Denver, and the inner neighborhood cooperation passed a motion directly from the floor supporting the moratorium. Unfortunately, the amendment language was not presented at that time, but in concept we do support the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do think it's important for people's mental health to be able to have enough space to. Rehabilitate themselves at the end of the day, know their neighbors, know what's going on around them. It it I and C's mission is not to destroy developers by any means.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We want to work with developers. We want to work with neighborhoods. That's what we're all about, is to make Denver the best city in the United States of America. And we appreciate everything that you're doing tonight. I think pause buttons are good.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sometimes you go too fast and you need to back up a little bit and think that we really intend to do that. So I support your efforts. Appreciate all you're doing. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Angela Steiner.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. My name is Angela Steiner. I live in Castle Rock while I work in Denver five and six days a week. I've also been a real estate broker for 16 years. Over the last several years, I've represented many developers and I can confirm that each and every one of these developers have been small business owners rather'",
        "'speaker_7': 'than faceless large corporations. Those developers livelihoods often depend on the success of every project, as they are not huge companies that can take losses or simply lower profits beyond a certain point. They have families and employees that depend on them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do applaud the city council tonight to allow the projects that are already in the system exempt from the moratorium. I do feel that that is right, rather than to adopt a blanket moratorium that would be effective immediately and devastate some of these families and developers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. All right. Okay. Okay. Robert Vogel. I'm going to call up I'm going to call up five others. I just we had a little malfunction here. Robert Vogel, Byron Beckman, John Albers and Cindy Piggott. Rob Pegg You might as well come to Rob Pegg.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Come on. Come on to. All right, Robert Vogel, you're up first.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. City Council Members. My name is Robert Vogel. I live at four, four.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Six Cook Street in Cherry Creek North.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I am president of the Cherry Creek North Neighborhood Association. And for starters, I want to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank our Councilperson Councilman New.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And Councilman Espinosa for introducing this bill. Let me give you a little history. About two months ago, we learned that the nursery on Garfield Street was destined to become a 30 unit apartment house. And. Our thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At that time, we called up our city council person and spoke with a very experienced aide.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Who said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They can't do that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because the city code is so ambiguous that it is not included in the intent of Rowe House buildings. We then called up city planning and they said, Oh yes, we know about that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we've given temporary approval. And I said, Can you send us the form?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the form was as councilman who said, not a garden cart form. It had a 15 foot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wide concrete pathway.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Therefore no garden, no court.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Within a couple of weeks, a speaker who will speak in a few minutes, Andy Piggott, collected 500.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Names on a petition against the development in this form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And because of this, we started a dialog with the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Arnold family, and I want to thank them for their willingness to consider.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Changes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the form.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of their.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Development, to make it compatible.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to enhance the neighborhood. We believe that the moratorium should go in place so that people don't have to call up their councilman to find out whether something is approved or not approved. The law should be clear.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'On this case. We believe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That 15 foot wide car doors are not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Gardens and cars. This is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not the intended.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Intention of the form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Through our dialogs. We have done away.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With the stacking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is not part of the row house form and we have decreased the density.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we have, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Believe, a much more.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Attractive form which includes gardens and courts. The intent is now made. We have an.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Executed contract with the family developing developing this. We strongly support the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you have heard, as a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Time out to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Reexamine.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What is become a contrivance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Within the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want the moratorium is time to look.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At compatibility with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Surrounding circumstance. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Bye. Let's see. Byron Beckman. As Byron Beckman. Okay. John Albers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. My name is John Albers. I live at 45 Steel Street. I'm on the board of directors of the Cherry Creek North Neighborhood Association, and I serve that organization as the chair of its zoning committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As has been said, we found ourselves in a situation where we had one project under construction in Cherry Creek North and another that was moving its way through the developer to the approval process under the garden form being considered and approved under the garden court form of construction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was a surprise to us when we dug into the code to find that there was a great deal of ambiguity and in fact some conflict in the code as to whether or not the Garden Court was in fact allowed in a g r h 13 zone, which is the primary residential zoning for Cherry Creek North.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if it was allowed, there was not clarity in terms of what exactly constituted the appropriate design and construction of the garden court form. And as counsel menu has pointed out, neither of these projects had either a court nor garden.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So from our perspective, while we were very happy to work with the developer on the project at 201 Garfield and, and that is excluded from this. While we were very happy to work with them going forward, we really need clarity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The residents of Cherry Creek North need to understand whether or not a garden court form is an approved form for the RH 13 zoning. And if it is under what what exact design forms, as Councilman News showed with the picture from the zoning code, what's in the zoning code relative to a diagram is much different than what'",
        "'speaker_5': 'was being approved. So we heartily and heartily and support the moratorium. We appreciate Councilman Espinosa and councilman's new support for this. We urge the City Council to support the moratorium and give us clarity or give the planning department time to get some clarity around these issues so that in the future we will know what's permitted and what's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'expected in this zoning area. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Cindy Pickett.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I appreciate it. My name is Cindy Pickett. I live at 214 Garfield directly across the street from the proposed development that was under question. Webster defines specific as clearly in exactly presented or stated, precise or exact, free from ambiguity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We purchased our home four years ago. We inquired about the possible development on Garfield, as did our neighbors, with their investments in the surrounding area. We did the due diligence. The realtors and all potential homeowners check the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It stated The regulations provide certainty to property owners, developers and neighborhoods about the limits for what is allowed in a residentially zoned area. The specific intent of grh3 states, a multi-unit district allowing urban house, duplex and row rowhouse building forms not taller than three stories specific, precise and exact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In early June, we were blindsided by a Newbury employee telling us that this development would be three, three story apartment buildings and we should put the sign up now. We immediately contacted CPD. Chris Glacier's response was, As for the intent, the description is not meant as an exhaustive list of anything that can be achieved in his own'",
        "'speaker_6': 'district, but rather a brief summary of the. Development potential. Clearly, specific content should have been titled Possible Intent because it was most definitely not specific and the regulations did not provide certainty. Every other zone state specifically where garden courts are allowed in the intent definition not je rh three two words admitted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We still await an explanation. While we appreciate Councilman News and Espinosa's superior efforts in addressing this issue, we face more than double the amount of units that should have been allowed on this property and the potential of 50 vehicles in the span of less than one block.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And quoting the CPD text amendment far greater density than intended by the adaptive plans and zoned district for the area. I'm sorry. I really have a dry mouth. This form is morphed into something unrecognizable. It is dwarfing existing homes, taking the light and leaving behind scars that affect the integrity and fabric of neighborhoods across the city, not'",
        "'speaker_6': 'just in Cherry Creek. It leaves no certainty to individuals that have invested and now must question what could happen next to them, in front of them, behind them, or even worse, on all sides, because that is the possibility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'CPD knew this was an issue. The egregious development proposed on Garfield was possibly the straw that broke the camel's back and brought it to the forefront. Visualized two thirds of one residential block with three three story apartment buildings, three exterior doors and 215 foot cement gangways.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Shame on them for allowing it to go this far. It should have been stopped. They knew it was wrong. Not clearly defined in the attempt and beyond any resemblance to a garden court. We encourage you to support the moratorium, gives CPD time to clarify the issue so it's not continue to affect neighborhoods throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many have already paid the price into developers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That say this is what.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The public wants. I challenge you to take a look at these neighborhoods, respect them the existing fabric, and create something that contributes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time is up. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, no problem. Thank you. Try to hold your applause as we get through all these. Speaker Wrap it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll try and follow up on what my wife had to say. My name is Rob Piggott. I also live at 214 Garfield, and I appreciate what Councilman Nu and Councilman Espino Espinosa have brought forward in regard to the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do have to say, though, that I feel that as a Cherry Creek resident that we we are a victim of a hit and run by city planning. Going back to early June of this year, city planning rebuffed our zoning inquiries regarding grades three.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In response to the Newberry apartment and city planning, the MISS dismissed our argument that the current zoning of Grace three was under specific and ten calls for multi-unit district, allowing for urban house duplex and row house building forms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nowhere in grace three specific intent does it call for a garden court or apartment forms after repeated inquiries. City planning did come around in late June, and foremost off the record, of course, that there is confusion and ambiguity in the George three definition that was followed up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Much to our dismay and surprise was see city planning advocating a 14 to 16 month moratorium at a city council planning meeting in early August. It is ironic that city planning suddenly got religion in regard to specific intent definition for Grace three, but only after allowing the Newbury Apartments to get in the so-called zoning pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is worth noting that some five families have moved the 200 Garfield block in the past four and a half years with Newbury Nursery and Retail, the elephant on the block. It was natural for us in the others to inquire about zoning relative to new areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These families and individuals to the person were referred to their realtor, referred by their realtor and the seller sellers realtor to series three specific intent, which allows for urban house duplex and row house building forms. So my question to city planning why was gardening caught in apartment form, admitted in specific intent?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She or age three and I would welcome their comment and I would also ask does city planning know the meaning of specific intent? With that said, I support the moratorium. But is present support. The moratorium is presented. Although I feel city planning has treated many of us adjacent to the Newbury Apartments very unfairly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. I'm going to call up the next five speakers and Cox, Peter Wall, Paula Arnold, Frank Locke and Toure and John Frey's. And Cox, you are first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for this opportunity. I'm an Cox. And I do support the moratorium because of the agreement worked out between S.C. Nay and the Newbury's. But I do so with my arm twisted behind my back and resigned to the fact that we can do no better.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This moratorium emerged as a short term solution to an absurd and unintended interpretation of the garden court building form. Something is seriously wrong when the specific intent of the code can be so easily circumvented by developers. Neighbors had no real notice that 30 apartments could be built there, where zoning led us to believe that there would be'",
        "'speaker_7': '10 to 12 row homes. And no meaningful recourse. Density is not the problem. The problem is that the code does not address the consequences of density. Number one among them is parking. As we've just finished hearing and in great detail, parking is grossly inadequate in the five Denver neighborhoods affected by the Garden Court problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Newbury Project will have 26 apartments, 36 parking spaces and just one parking space per unit. The ten extra spaces could be visitor parking. Instead, those spaces we rented to the highest bidders, the tenants and their guests will park bumper to bumper on Garfield Street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Second, developers should have setbacks that conform to the character of the neighborhood. The Newbury slipped through a loophole that requires only a 20 foot setback from the street and a ridiculous five foot setback along Second Avenue. Eight other homes on their side of Garfield have forefoot setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The code calls for setback, conformity. If there are three lots that have a bigger setback. In this case, there are eight homes on two lots. So that doesn't apply. Third, the code nominally requires development in harmony with the character of the existing neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Textual amendments to the code will, I hope, close the loopholes that allowed this awful garden court slot. Home Development. Development should also reflect harmony with other city plans. Here, Garfield is designated as a bikeway. It is dangerous to bike on a street that has bumper to bumper parking and a travel lane too narrow for two cars to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'pass at the same time. In closing, please make future developers provide adequate resident and visitor parking. Conform to the by setbacks on the block. Build in harmony with what already exists in the neighborhood and protect city bikeways. And I also ask that developers exempted from the moratorium be held accountable for adhering to the letter and spirit of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the agreements that exempted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Them this time as a thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You all. Good evening, council members. Peter Wall, 1660 Lincoln Street here on behalf of the Newberry family and just wanted to make myself available for questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Paula Arnaud.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm Paul Arnold, and I live at 201 Monroe. And I've lived in Cherry Creek my entire life. I was born there. I was raised there. I work there and I'll die there, I'm sure. Same spot I When we started into this, we were doing what was allowed by this zoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I want to first of all, I want to thank all the council members for listening and meeting with us. And also I want to thank Councilman who for working with us and also the Cherry Creek Neighborhood Association to come to an approved project that better incorporates what the neighborhood would would like.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm here if there's any further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Frank. I can talk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Frank Victoria. I live a 2145 East 16th Avenue and I am I was I against the moratorium. But I mean I think that the what you've proposed councilman to you know makes a whole lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and my only concern here is that I feel like and maybe this is just because of tonight's agenda, it seems like moratorium is the go to and I guess I'm a little bit concerned about a continual, you know, slowdown of things when I feel like the the items that you put on up there were completely reasonable'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so I, I feel like there is somewhat of a simple solution of that, the ratio that there's a ratio of height to the width of the courtyard. And you know, I know that it's not that simple, but I do have to wonder about, you know, if moratorium is is the right the right process, you know, for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this, you know, particular issue, you know, thanks. And I'll take my answer off the air.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. John Frase.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. Good evening and thank you, Councilman Nu, and thank you to the Council for listening to us. I've been a 15 year resident of Cherry Creek. I have 15 other family members who live in Denver. So we're all very concerned about preserving the quality of neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I would just reiterate what my predecessors before me have have said about being in favor of this moratorium. I mean, it doesn't take a lot of common sense to look at the pictures that the councilman knew I was looking at and seeing a before and after view of something.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, to think that it could have evolved, there must be a pretty big loophole for that to have happened. So I would appreciate any anything that can be done in this moratorium. I think it's very, very, very much needed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to call up the last four speakers. Peter Benson, Justin. Archuleta, Julian. Joanne But I don't ever. Linda Herman How could they do that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Daniel puts electrodes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Peter. You're first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then when I assume anything. Peter Benson with Coble and Company. I reside in Castle Pines and work in the city of Denver. I manage urban homes. We focus on walkable neighborhoods in Denver doing urban infill sites. I do want to state that I think the garden court form is an important form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I agree there's loopholes to it and there's challenges there. And I agree the states should be looking at that, but it's an important form. We've been working on a project in one of the last pieces in Lowry on First Avenue, inside a court that is an awkwardly shaped property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We struggle with the site plan, and we ended up with what I think is a great site plan. The amendment calls for it to be exempt tonight. And I've heard from staff and the sponsors of the bill that what they're looking for are opening on the street for the garden quarters over 50 feet at the entrance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It gets wider beyond that. It's actual gardens and courts. So there's there's no loopholes here. But I do want to stress that we've worked on it for over a year, spent a lot of money on it. And I would encourage you to support the amendment if you do the moratorium, because even if you approve tonight, we still'",
        "'speaker_5': 'think we're exempt from the language I have in the draft. Staff has told us that it would still take some time for them to review the moratorium, the language for exemptions and to for us to resubmit RSVP for the next round before we would know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I appreciate the amendment proposed and I hope that gets approved as part of the moratorium. And I have a question you can certainly answer later before we're done tonight, but I didn't quite catch all the changes for the amendment and the draft I have in section one, on page two, around lines 19 and 20 and 21'",
        "'speaker_5': ', it exempts things where the courtyard is wider than the tallest buildings. So my question is, even beyond this tonight, as someone comes in in three or six months during the moratorium, can they submit, if they meet that requirement, that language still be in there?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I also have a request not to get into the weeds, but that's where we spend a lot of our time. And your staff spends a lot of their time, by necessity, in section two on lines 24 and 25.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It talks about the drawings have to be side by side and not stacked and says no part of any dwelling shall be vertically above the other ones. And I'd like some clarification so that we can have appurtenances like eaves and gutters from other units overhanging others, because we have some units that are one and two and three'",
        "'speaker_5': 'story next to each other. So I think it'd be helpful for staff to have the guidance that we can have. Appurtenances overlapping them but not livable space. You know, all in all, I do want to reiterate that I think it's an important forum going forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I agree it should be looked at in more detail. I think the opportunity was offered before that and the task force to people like us to be a part of the task force. We'd like to be a part of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We think there's some good ideas we would have because it's always tough. And I don't envy staff trying to write the new language because it's tough to create great design with formulas and numbers. And there has to be some quantitative things that are for quality of space performance materials.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Justin Archuleta. Good evening. My name is Justin Archer Letta. I'm a homeowner. Homeowner at 1599 West Berkeley Place in District one. And I care greatly about how our city is governed. I'm here today in support of the moratorium as amended that would exempt applications that have already been submitted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to kind of reiterate what Council Member Brook said about development companies having the potential to have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into planning. But I would also like to echo the sentiment that. Development companies, some that are small businesses could have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars if not seven figures on land and be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a week, two weeks, a month away from submission into the city. So this does leave. Many small businesses potentially hanging. And it's not necessarily just about this proposal, this moratorium. You are setting a precedent that this can be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would echo councilperson ken each and that caution is required. There is a balance. I understand that intent and outcome aren't always the same. I Denver zoning code is long. It's complex. As someone who has worked with architects and developers, a lot of times it is manipulating the code to see what works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's back and forth with community planning and development. But the fact of the matter is that there have been other Garden Corps apartment forms that have been approved, that have been built, that have set precedent for other developers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilperson Espinosa actually ran on a platform that he said what convinced him to run was one such development. But that was over a year ago. So developers have had a year. Looking to successful built projects. Having the implied approval from city councilor, from community planning and development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That those types of projects are okay. Now I understand that. I like like Councilperson Espinosa said, you don't leave the water running when you're trying to fix the pipe. But at the same time, you don't leave a broken pipe for a year and get mad at everybody else for taking advantage of the water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd also like to kind of echo councilperson ken each in that I think the rhetoric is somewhat fearful when we get into these discussions of development and density. I am someone that is moving into what is some people over term a slot home.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm under contract to purchase. I'm extremely excited about it. My neighbors are excited. I volunteer in the neighborhood. I am a valuable member of the community. And just because my choices for the type of house that I would like to live in don't match what maybe previous generations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, look at the generational gap and speakers here. There needs to be some openness, some understanding. Absolutely. I'll be doing my best to get other people from my generation and a chance to let your time's up. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you. All right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Jahan Durrani. So John Barrios is. Yeah, we're working on it. Okay. So thank you all for your patience. I'm a lot less nervous this time around. So you've already heard my story. You know why this is important to me?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I really want to advocate the importance of housing stock because I think contrary to some of the points that all of you express, I think one unit that gets added to the market, it doesn't matter if it's a family unit, if it's a single unit, it impacts the market as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think we're really missing that bigger picture. So maybe you wouldn't like to live in a prison and maybe you wouldn't like to live in a 300 unit square home. But the developers don't invest things they won't sell.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those units are going to fill up and we're adding housing stock to the market by constructing those units. And so my concern is very similar to what Frank mentioned before, as now the moratorium is just becoming the way, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if I have a problem with something, I want a moratorium because I don't like something that looks like a prison. I want to make sure I have sufficient housing. And I think we're setting a really bad precedent because I think if we all think that in seven months, the other moratorium is going to go away and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this one is just going to go away in 12 months, I don't think we're being realistic as to how this public advocacy process works. Right. It's the people who are most passionate, who have the loudest voices, who show up to the meetings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so as a council, I think you have to be the voices for the bigger picture. And you have to think about housing stock. You have to think about the market and you have to think about all of these other things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is really hard when you're an individual and you're kind of locked into your view. So just remember housing stock, it's really important. Don't forget, I absolutely understand that we need to make changes to the code, but you don't need a moratorium to do that, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, you can do that. You can make changes to the code, you can make adjustments. You don't have to stop development and an increase to housing stock to do that. So just something to consider. Thank you. It's a late night.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you guys for being here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Joann Barrios. Thank you. All right, Eva, Linda Herman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, everyone, and thank you so much for your time. It's been a long night. I do want to say something that was brought up tonight about how much money the developers are spending. We, the citizens, have also spend a lot of money and time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I see everyone in our neighborhood which had beautiful trees. I see them all at Home Depot buying their flowers. We take great pride. So we have spent equally as much, probably much more so than all developers combined as individual people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So please keep that in mind.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Before purchasing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In Cherry Creek North. I checked the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Which states that we are zoned for single family dwellings, duplexes and row.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Homes that the setback of any new development would have to meet the excess existing homes. But we are now facing an apartment complex claiming to be a garden court.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With a deviation to the setback due to yet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Another.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Loophole. We discovered all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These problems by accident and begin the process by contacting our city councilman and circulating a petition to bring awareness about this development. We acquired more than 500 signatures. What we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Didn't do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Was hire an attorney.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then, ten days before tonight's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hearing, another Denver neighborhood advice is to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hire a lobbyist and an attorney because the developer had both. Interesting. We had reached out to new that buried developers to no avail.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But within hours.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the developer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hearing we had a lobbyist. They sent us a horrible plan 2026 stack units on 8/10 of an.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Acre, doubling the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Housing on a block. By the way, we only had the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lobbyist for a few hours because Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You and Councilman Espinosa were helping us reach a compromise. We thank them for their work and because of their work. The stacking has been removed, but we are still stuck with setbacks that do not match the block.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are being forced to accept high density apartments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why can't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The developer be forced to accept setbacks to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Match the block? That to me is a compromise. When both of us were a little bit unhappy, we understand that if the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Garfield.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Apartments are not allowed to continue, in spite.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of all the problems recognized by the citizens.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And CPD, then City Council will not pass the moratorium. In other words, the Garfield apartments are allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To live and we are the sacrificial lamb to save other Denver neighborhoods. But the developers are not budging.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'From 26 units on a 10th of an acre with insufficient parking and a non-conforming setback. So again, we are begging.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You for relief. I have the dream that you city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Council will give.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Us a Hollywood ending.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That you will stand up tonight and at least give us the setbacks. That you will stand up and protect your citizens. That you will remember that on August 3rd you sat and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Heard CPD give a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Presentation stating that there is something wrong with the zoning code. Please stand up tonight and give us the setbacks for the integrity of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have the power.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Please give us that Hollywood ending. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr.. Ceremony. So you guys clapped and I couldn't. Ms.. Herman, can you please come back up here? You didn't state your name. I just want to make sure it's on the record. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm Evo. Linda Herman. I live at 215 Monroe Street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nice Hollywood ending there. Okay. This concludes our speakers questions for members of council. Okay. I will start with my question. Oh, I can't see. Okay. Madam Secretary, I cannot see. Yeah. I can't see this because. Yeah. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I had a couple of question, but I already.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Forgot one of them. But, Kyle, this question is for you. So earlier we were looking at the small zone lot parking moratorium, which I know was a long process, as you stated. But can you tell us the difference between these two processes?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I, I know this one is being rushed, and I know there were some concerns about that from CPD. So if you could just sort of explain the difference of how these two got to us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Regarding the moratorium bill specifically, sir. So again, for the record, I'm Kyle Dalton with the Department of Community Planning and Development. Yeah, I mean, with the first one, the councilmembers approached us, I think about a month before the bill was filed, and we helped them draft the bill in concert with the city attorney's office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other bill, we we weren't approached that far in advance. So we have as much time to, you know, help us include the language at least so we could better administer the bill. Now, since that time, the sponsor we we reviewed the bill after you published it on first reading and provided some technical comments which the sponsors'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have agreed to put forth in an amendment tonight that would address so that we at least we can administer the intent of the the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And a couple more questions. So it does say in the bill that. Garden plants can be processed as long as they comply with all applicable requirements with certain conditions. So it's not that all garden courts are going to be stop.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's just ones that have this very.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Narrow courtyard and a few other.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Things. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. Anything that's got a concept review now moves forward regardless, and then future ones would have to meet the conditions in the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then I know the answer to this, but.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This does not address slot homes that have a driveway between the two. The buildings. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. The garden court building form is just one building form in which folks build sideways facing row homes, slate homes, or whatever you call them. And it's not a very commonly used form.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In what zone district are those permitted in the slide homes?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, goodness. Dozens. I mean, they're they're allowed in more than five different building forms in dozens of zone districts across the city. Which is why CPD earlier this month initiated a text amendment that would look more holistically at the issue of slot homes and the design of sideways facing row homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because it is. It's bigger than this one building form where we're going to need to look at it. And all zone districts throughout the city where where these things are getting built, even the ones that that this moratorium has nothing to do with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. But the garden court is just one aspect of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. And it's an important aspect, you know, but it's just one part of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Espinosa. Thank you, Councilman Black, for those questions because it sort of it gets to the specificity of this moratorium and it's actually one of the few easily captures or situations. Mike. My question is regarding Mr. Benson's questions about the actual ordinance and probably best for either you, Kyle, or the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He specifically mentioned a concern about section two on page, page two about the the whether ease and the like would be considered part of the unit. And do you have any sort of my sense is that the intent of the the the way it would be interpreted would be that we're talking about dwelling unit overlap and not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'actual eaves. I mean, generally ees are accepted by, you know, they're allowed to extend over, over, over setback lines and other things. So do you do we have a reading on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Adam Hernandez, assistant city attorney. Just to clarify, Councilman, you're asking about. So maximum height in feet?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. So it is the following. So the line reads in section two and it's the first sentence after the colon. It says, in no part of any dwelling in is constructed vertically above any other part of any part of another dwelling unit and each built building bounding the courtyard shell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it's really that the way this written is written and no part of any dwelling unit is constructed. We're talking about when when the concern about stacked spaces. It's not the wall with or projections or eaves and sills and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's actually the habitable space of the unit. That's the dwelling unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. It talks about a. No part of any dwelling unit constructed vertically above the one below.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you want to? I'll just I'll just add. So when it comes to interpretation of language, I think it's a good question that our staff are going to have to look at in the context of a specific development plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Normally in the code, we address the term dwelling unit by specifying whether we're referring to the use or the structure. The language here doesn't provide us that clarity, but we'll we'll use our typical process of bringing interpretations to the various zoning managers who are responsible for the interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then, of course, if the applicant thinks that we've interpreted wrong, they can appeal that decision to the Board of adjustment. Right. I think generally based on the comments I've heard from council and the public, they would be more they would be more in favor of details being able to project rather than clear flat facades with no'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with no detail. The other question also relates to Peter Vincent's about I want to make it clear he was concerned and actually other developers and members of the audience that spoke to concerns about moratoria. Mr. Hernandez This moratorium does allow the use of the garden court during the next 12 months, provided that it meets those exceptions, correct'",
        "'speaker_0': '? Correct? Yeah. So, I mean, the garden court is alive and well. It's just the the slot home version. And this goes back to the conversation we're having citywide about the use. I mean, this the slot home form that you won't find anywhere in the building code, meaning the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it it does it is something you can create using general building form. And so while the community is going to have a larger conversation, this will at least address the use of this form in in certain zoned districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll save the rest for my comments later. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Kyle, can I ask you just a quick question to clarify? I understand that a townhome or a row home is all vertical and there's no stacking of units. But why is it why is it that garden court cannot have any stacking of units?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What's the purpose of that? What's the reason for that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I should be clear as as we interpret and administer the Denver zoning code as it's currently written, you can stack your address on both.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Yep. Thank you. The way I was reading this was that we didn't allow that at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it wouldn't be allowed in. The moratorium passes. Okay. That's a distinction between the code we administer today and what the moratorium would do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So then to clarify the garden court form during the moratorium, if they meet these other conditions can continue to be processed and accept accepted and processed, but only if they're not stacked.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Among other conditions. That's correct. They will not be able to be stopped. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can I ask maybe Councilman Nur Espinosa why? Why that is. Mr. President, can I can I ask him?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, please. I thought they should respond right away. Councilman. So the real reason is if we. So the purpose of the moratorium and the reason to move this forward the way we did is to stop the egregious use of the form.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the form was intended to be mapped to our former R2 zone districts, which were single-family duplex areas in the rowhouse was conceived as an idea in the specific intent, as a way of sort of increasing density, but still orienting these developments towards the street and managing mean having a healthy set back and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's the the, the, the issue. But so what, what the Garfield project in particular represents is actually what's specifically permitted and prevented in those rowhouses and districts is the apartment form, which would be a multi-unit stacked configuration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But by placing essentially two apartment forms 15 feet apart and calling a court between those buildings, the garden court, and then orienting the doors towards that thing, you're now effectively building two apartment buildings in a row house alone district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so by getting rid of the mean life defining dwelling units as being non vertically stacked, we're at least getting to what even those egregious uses are already, which are sort of simple developments. You can still rent them, but it only gets at least one unit per door facing the street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just want to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Make sure that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'When the moratorium is over, then. A garden court forms applications can still be accepted. Can then be accepted when they include stacked units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, that would be specifically. I think it's yes, but. Oh, I didn't understand the question. Yes. When the moratorium expires, it's no longer in effect unless the council changes that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Unless we change the definition. Okay. Thank you. That's a great clarification. I appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilman Flint Kent. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Dalton, you almost got to sit down there. That was close. You were dreaming of the bench, weren't you? I'm just wondering if you could address the set back issue that was brought up as to why the proposed Garfield development apparently does not have setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That reference, what's existing on the rest of the block?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'm sorry. I'm I'm only prepared tonight to speak to the to the bill and not to a specific project. I don't have those details in front of me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. I have a question for you. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. So I'm going to go back to Councilman Black's questioning around the what forms are allowed in the slot house fro homes is what folks call it in my district, fake row homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, there was a there was a news article released saying that this moratorium takes care of all slaughterhouses. And so I just want to that is not true just for the public. What percentage would you say of this moratorium in front of us deals with the kind of fake row home in the slot home issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So the best we can do is do an estimate, right? Because slot home isn't a defined term. What looks like one to somebody else may not to another. Our best guess of what we have in the pipeline today is approximately 8 to 10 times more projects being built that are sideways facing row homes in other forms'",
        "'speaker_0': 'than in garden court form. Okay, 8 to 10. So what percentage? So that would be, you know, 80% are not are not guarded. So 90%. So what what's in front of us today is about 10 to 20%. I think the councilman was correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have three in the pipeline right now. So it's it's a very small portion of what we have under review. Can you can you share specifically what other forms that I mean, I think you guys are looking at this at a macro level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, we're excited to hear what solutions you come up with, but what other forms are in this kind of sideways home, you know, slot home? Sure. So the most common ones we see are in the apartment building form or the general building form.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, those forms aren't allowed in the zone district where that one project is that a lot of folks have talked about today. And I think Councilman Espinosa did a good job of explaining in the Rowhouse District, you can't do an apartment or you can't do in a general.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in our multi-unit and our mixed use commercial zone districts where those forms are allowed, that's where we're seeing the more often. Yeah. And so this is just a question to Councilman knew and and Councilman Espinosa, I know this was a I was out, so I'm just now getting this but this was an knows fast process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But was there any consideration for having a larger conversation around some of these other forms? To be honest, Councilman Brooks, that would be a very, very, very heavy lift for this council. That is, there are so many zone districts we couldn't even I we could we could quantify that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it is a very large number and it would be very hard to I mean, you would basically be laying a moratorium on both the apartment form and the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'General building form, which.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would be disastrous for the city. To be honest now, it just seems like this is a big issue citywide. And if 10%, 20% is what we're after, that it seems like I just want to make sure that we're looking at this whole thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, we are the legislative body of the city, right? The macro view of this. And so I am concerned about that. Other now Carl didn't speak with specificity over what we're looking at as CPD, you know, in the future and I know there's some others, but that's just my concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's just come up. Councilman, do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They, sir? Sure know. Walter said she would like to get into SWAT homes in the garden court evaluation. So? So they're thinking about similar kinds of forms where they really need greater definitions of. So I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't get into some of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the focus will be on Gordon. Gordon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Yeah. Actually, CPD is is part in parallel with this garden court moratorium. They're spending the next 14 months specifically trying to address this at home in a task force community outreach manner. That said, and this is going to strike fear in every developer in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, the exemptions that we have written in here could actually be put forward in a general building form, basically requiring that, you know, because right now we have an unlimited number of buildings that can occur on certain zoned lots.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the building code only requires a six or ten foot minimum distance. So you could actually say, well, we're going to make it mean that any two buildings that are residentially occupied 100% really need to be separated by a certain you could address it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But yeah, so I think it's just an important, just important for our folks at home and the audience to to know that, you know, what's before us today handles a slice of some of the maybe the issues that we see in CPD, but not the full kind of breadth of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I appreciate that. Mr. DALTON. Let's let's talk more theoretically on setbacks, if we can. Is it. Accurate or even close to. We have a general policy of trying to keep uniform setbacks in zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it depends on the zone district. But many most of our residential districts include what we call a block sensitive setback. Right. So that requires that. On that, what people refer to as the front setback, be sensitive to the setbacks of other buildings along the block.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Different rules apply depending on where you are in the block. And I think part of what's going on here is it's a corner lot where where there's a different analysis and the rule of measurement about which lots you look at in terms of what you have to be sensitive to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a it's a complicated part of the code. And that's that's part of why I can't answer on the fly. But yes, in general, we have a block sensitive set back and it would apply in the grades three zone district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Would you mind doing that analysis when you have a minute and get that and give me that information for sure. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to ask a process question. And, Kyle, you're probably the best person to answer this. So in terms of next steps, assuming this passes here tonight, what what are the next steps for how CPD will handle this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will they be selecting who the people are that will serve as representatives similar to what we just talked about regarding the previous moratorium that we passed. So help me understand that as well as the timing of it in terms of how quickly that will ramp up and will that be done internally?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Great question. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. So with regards to the garden court moratorium specifically, we will begin enforcing it as soon as it goes into effect, which would be later this week. The mayor signs the bill and so on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would that would start for all consent reviews. Typically, that happens after Thursday of this week. So so that's the garden court issue. But the bigger picture about the lot home text amendment that were that we announced earlier this month that we would initiate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've spent the past couple of weeks assembling our staff team, assigning project managers, getting folks involved. You know, we've had to put other work on hold in order to prioritize this in our work program. So we've we've built a good internal team.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what we're doing over the next month and a half or so is as that initial work of ramping up a project problem identification and the rest, we announced that we would do a public kick off, we expect in October where we identify the stakeholder groups and we do think it's important to have a cross-section of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'community and a cross-section of diverse perspectives on that stakeholder group, the task force, whatever it has called. So design professionals, architects, neighborhoods that are affected by this, you know, folks involved in finance. We think there's a broad perspective that needs to be brought to the table.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The idea of a first task force meeting sometime later this year, maybe November, from kick off the best schedule we've been able to come up with so far would be 14 to 16 months. So we think we would have a package before this council at the end of next year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but that process will will involve a lot of problem identification, upfront testing of solutions, using real life examples so we can find loopholes before we create them, write a new draft and do the drafting process. And then, of course, there's a series of public hearings and a public adoption process that would happen over the end of'",
        "'speaker_0': '2017. As with any of these large text amendments, like like a proposed square, like Cherry Creek, where we're tackling multiple diverse issues that that need that stakeholder perspective. We do expect to bring on board third party folks, particularly with the facilitation of those stakeholder meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we may also draw on other third party resources we know will draw on outside design professionals to supplement our internal design staff. And there may be more resources to be brought to the table on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So can you tell me how the work that's going on with Blueprint Denver, with the multiple consultants that we've brought on board to help us, you know, look at revising Blueprint Denver, how any of that correlates to the two conversations we're having here tonight or how these fit into that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, the really.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Different questions, right? So Denver, right. And Blueprint, Denver Update and the other plans that are part of the Denver right effort are citywide planning their vision, their future policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So are these.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we're talking about here is a change to the regulation. So it's taking the code in and changing it. There's there's certain amounts that we think you can do with what you already have adopted in your plans that are calling for regulations that respect neighborhood character, that advance areas of change in areas of stability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There probably are issues that folks would like to address through this text amendment that instead need blueprint Denver guidance first. And so those would have to be in a future phase of regulatory implementation. I think of things like design review, like whole different bodies of staff, like things that aren't already embedded in the city's broad policy visions'",
        "'speaker_0': ', that that's the kind of thing where Blueprint Denver in the Denver process will help inform future regulatory implementation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, and again, just getting back to the staffing issue. So did we factor in any. Leeway in those contracts to be able to utilize some of those folks that we're already, you know, that are already under contract with the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These would be blueprint and some of the other planning efforts that we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, not the Denver right contracts. What we'll use are the regulatory contracts that we have. Again, they're separate skill sets and they're different folks that we would need. So instead of the the the kinds of professionals we would use, like we use on Arapaho Square that we like, we use on Cherry Creek or that we would have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'used on Golden Triangle if we hadn't delayed that project to make room for this one. You know, we'll use those kinds of folks rather than the Denver right contracts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're going to do that because we don't have that staff expertize or we just don't have enough staff. No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think a third party perspective really adds an additional lens to, you know, can bring the kind of this is what other cities are doing. This is, you know, best practices around the world. Also, having a third party facilitator helps build trust among the stakeholder committee where the city is one of the parties at the table, but'",
        "'speaker_0': 'isn't the party steering. And so we found that to be an effective way that's really brought forth those previous amendments I've mentioned that have, you know, really come forward with folks in alignment on the outcome and the consensus building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's where we find that third party voice is really helpful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That was helpful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'll just touch on that because we just went through the Arapahoe Square text amendment and we had a third party come and walk us through that. And as neighbors and, you know, city council folks and developers, it was an amazing process that brought us to a I think a pretty good conclusion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for that. All right. Are seeing no other comments. Our our public hearing is closed for council. Bill 541 councilman new. Would you like to offer your new amendment to the council? Bill 541 Please read the particulars.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All right, we will start again. Here again. I move that amendment council bill 541, as amended on July 21st, 2016, as follows. Number one on page two, line 70, strike the word courtyard and replace it with going forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Number two, on page two, line eight, strike the word courtyard and replace with garden court. Number three on line two, lines 18. Insert the word tallest before the word proposed and before. On page two, lines 18 and 19 strike the words buildings abutting the garden courtyard, buildings abutting the courtyard, and replace with buildings whose facade bounds the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'garden court. Number five on page two, line 20, insert the words building form after the words garden court. Number six on our page two, line 21, insert the word R before the word units. Number seven on page two, line 23, strike the word court already replace with Gordon Court.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now read our page to line 24. Strike the word courtyard replaced with Gordon Corn on number nine on page two. Line 31. Add a new section which reads as follows Section five This moratorium shall not apply to complete applications for a mandatory review concept review pursuant to section 12 .3.2.2 of the Denver Zoning Code, which are which'",
        "'speaker_8': 'are submitted in advance of a required site development plan per section 12 .4.3.3 of the Denver Zoning Code and accepted by the Planning, Community Planning and Development Owner before the effective date of this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved in second to comments by members of council and the council. I'm going to go right to you, but I want to remind members of council this is on the specific amendment. Will then give you comments for the whole bill later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Councilman. No.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. I think this is the most important part about this amendment is is allowing the pending applications, those three pending applications to go through. We appreciate the number Arnolds, as they've really negotiated and worked with the neighborhood to develop the project and refine the project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So and so I think this this section will address those issues, those three applications that we've mentioned to go through. So I encourage my colleagues to support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great Councilman Flint.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Putting on my old editor's cap again, can I bring out a correction that needs to be made to the amendment? The one line that's number six. Insert the word R before the word units. It should actually be after the word units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's let's look at Adam Hernandez. Is that would you concur?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is correct. Okay. So I believe at this point, Councilman Flynn would have to offer an additional amendment. Okay. And have that seconded and. Then down the ladder.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sorry, Councilman Cashman. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'May I offer then a motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just if the two are in secondary, agree to the change they can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that would be okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does the mover in second agree to the change?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So can Secretary. Do we need to go to that whole. Oh, okay. Okay. You can just do the change on the fly here. Or do we need to read it back into the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. It'll be corrected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's corrected.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The only other comment I would make on is that we continue to have the issue with the pagination from word into PDF so that the amendments when it refers to line page in line has no relationship to what we're actually looking at.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it took me a little bit of time to find that mistake. Will that be corrected? Do we know in our new system?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll get an answer to you. Later on. But thank you for catching that. That was good. Councilman Espinosa. I just want to thank my colleague, Councilman Nu, and his staff, Melissa Horne, for the work in getting getting to this amendment and getting to today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks. Great. I'll offer a comment. This is this was probably one of the most important pieces for me supporting this piece. And I appreciate you included in as I had residents. Small business owners, developers who were concerned about this piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you so much. Okay. We have a first in a second. Madam Secretary, roll call on the new amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'New Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black Eye. Clark. Espinosa. Hi, Flynn. Hi, Gilmore. I heard in. Cashman. I can eat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'LOPEZ All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, Madam Secretary, announce the close of voting in US results.'",
        "'speaker_2': '11 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '11 I's Council Council Bill 541 has been amended. Counsel No. We need a motion to place upon final consideration and do pass as amended.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. A move to Council Bill 541 to be placed upon final consideration, do pass as amended August 22nd, 2016.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved seconded comments by members of Council. This is on the entire bill now. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I'm talking so much tonight. I have a few comments. One, I want to say that the developers who have built this garden court farm with the 15 foot wide court on whether we consider it a garden or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're actually following the rules and I think it's unfair to accuse them of doing something wrong or unethical, but they were following the rules that the city had. And so in this example of on Garfield Street with the Newbury family, they were also following the rules.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think they were trying to put one over on anyone. They were following the rules and doing what was permitted under our code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I do commend their willingness.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To meet with the neighbors. And thank you to Councilman Nu for bringing everyone together and and coming up with a great compromise. I am going to be supporting this, but I would not have supported it without that amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Protecting those that were.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the pipeline. My third point is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That I have faith in our community planning and development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Office. They are professionals and none of us sitting up here are urban planners. So you have a lot of work before you. So thank you for your expertize at that. I think it's dangerous, as several people have said, that we might set a precedent of all of us sitting up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here rewriting the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't think that's what we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Want to do when we've got.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Experts who know what they're doing. And lastly, just I was.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Remembering a council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Before I was a council person. And Councilman Clark's predecessor, Chris Nevitt, used the word cognitive dissonance to describe the fact that here in Denver we have a severe housing shortage, which several people referenced. And with our low supply and our high demand, our rents are high.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a common law of economics.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we still.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Have resistance to more housing projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not judging anyone or anything. I just think there's a lot to be said for that. We all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Acknowledge that we have a shortage, but none of us really.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can agree upon where we should build new housing. So just a little shout out to Chris Nevitt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Black. Councilman Nu.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to come in and I really appreciate the collaborative process we've had. We've had a lot of discussions. I couldn't think of a more passionate group of residents and we haven't agreed. North They're just phenomenal to work with and and really explained issues to me so clearly that it helped me very much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I really appreciate all the help that you gave me on this. We have a wonderful neighborhood association led by Bob Vogel and and John Albers. And and their leadership has been really appreciated in this and especially the Arnold Palmer and Paul Arnold coming to the table to negotiate this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we understand that the code was the code, but but you're willing to to make the project even better and and being willing to share the design with residents too. And so the it should be an attractive asset for the for the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I really appreciate this effort and especially appreciate Councilman Espinoza and his architectural skills to help us with this. It's great to have that kind of qualification on city council to help us with these difficult zoning matters, you know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thank you, everyone. Tonight, I look forward to and encourage all our our councilmen to pass this moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman new Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to commend Councilman Nolan, Councilman Espinosa, for the real hard work that they put through on this. I as well was very pleased to see the amendment come forth. But if I'm understanding correctly, it wasn't simply, okay, we'll just let this slide through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm aware that Councilman Espinosa has been spending a lot of time working with with applicants, trying to create projects that that meet what they're trying to create out of the garden court form. And I very much appreciate that and I very much appreciate the Arnolds and the others who were willing to compromise along the way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, as far as. People were just playing by the rules. I'm going to take a little bit of issue with that in that the people that are interpreting our zoning code are very bright people. And you look at the book, you're an architect or a designer or an experienced developer, and you see the picture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of what we're looking for out of a garden court and to look at that picture, if you have if your interest is in creating a community in Denver for the long haul, you're going to look at that picture of garden court and see that 15 foot minimum and go, huh?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Something's something's wrong here, not you. We can we can squeeze something in here. So I want to again commend the Arnolds and their willingness to compromise and take to task the people out there who are looking for those loopholes because there's going to be loopholes existing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I remember when they first started talking about the zoning code update, I don't know, 2007, eight, six, whenever it was. And it was going to be simplified because we have this big zoning book, Chapter 59 zoning code was this big, monstrous thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we were promised this going to be simple. You're not envisioning like a copy of Mad magazine. You flip through it and you know what you're doing. Well, our current zoning code is bigger than the last one, so there's going to be problems along the way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think we need to hold ourselves and our development community to a higher standard of conscience to build the city that we want. So thank you. That's all I got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Then again, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa, first thing, I want to thank Kyle for that that explanation and answer to the question about what's next and how that overlaps with Denver. Right. I just the whole time you were talking, I just thought that was the greatest answer you could have come up with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's it just tells me that we got the right person in the right place at the right time to help us get and negotiate this next iteration of Blueprint. Denver. So thank you for that, for that response.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then if I want to make it very clear that if you're looking for places to develop housing, including high density development housing, don't be afraid to call me. There are places really developable parcels in northwest Denver that could capture increased increased dwelling units on those properties and good projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you're a good developer and you got creative solutions, feel free to call me and I will happily steer you to where we've got ample development opportunity. So as much pressure as we are feeling from development, there are still ample places that could use your creativity and I would be happy to sort of work with you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on those. But specific to this moratorium, this moratorium is vital to give, are capable, truly capable, but overburdened community planning and development staff the opportunity to come up with appropriate standards to capture the intent of this form. The moratorium with with the exceptions, is to ensure that we aren't continuing to create a problem over and over in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'neighborhood after neighborhood. While changes are made to the garden court form standards and application for the sake of for sake of comparison, as was already mentioned, you do not leave the water running when you're trying to fix a pipe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The moratorium is a temporary shut off to fix the problem, and once corrected, improvements to the form and its applicability will allow for improved outcomes when the garden court form is used. So I am convinced this is not an easy task, but there are there is a need for this form and appropriate uses of this form and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it's going to take a public process to hammer out how that should be. But as it is today, it shouldn't. I like to thank CPD staff, CPD and the staff for all their hard work on this moratorium. And I look forward to working together with CPD and constituents and stakeholders, including developers, over the next 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Finding new solutions. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President, I just wanted to make sure that anybody who might be watching this meeting isn't assuming that these two moratoriums are going to stop all development in this city. And, you know, we know that there are other sites available across the city, many of which, as I indicated earlier, we've already re zoned where we have the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ability for high density housing. In fact, I was looking at some data and. What what's happening is we're seeing lots of apartment buildings being built because of the impact that state legislation on construction defects had for for sale housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now in my neighborhood, we've continued to have for sale housing being built, but it's at the top of the AMIS scale and we've seen somewhere in the ballpark of 20,000 units that have been built, apartment units throughout the metro area over the last year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so it's not like the development isn't happening. The issue is that we have 100,000 people a year moving here from other cities, and that has created the demand and the pressures that we're seeing happen. And so I think being able to take this time out, we all know that part of what makes Denver such a great'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city is our great neighborhoods and and people. You know, as we've heard, a number of folks testify, they live where they are because they love the neighborhoods. And when we began to completely change the fabric of some of the neighborhoods, it's why we've seen residents across the city come out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I remember when the Sloan's like neighborhood was starting to see single family homes and being replaced with duplexes. We all know it started in Cherry Creek, but that, you know, has sort of begun to happen in in neighborhoods across the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But these two efforts tonight do not in themselves prevent other development from happening across the city that will continue to occur. So I just didn't want people to walk away thinking, you know, this just stops all development across the city and that is not the case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I will be supporting this tonight. I think, again, taking this time out to be able to ensure that the the information that people look at when they come to our planning department is is clear. And it gives clear direction to both neighborhoods and to the developers who are trying to do development in this city, particularly around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this garden. And I just want to thank everybody who's been involved in moving this forward, particularly councilman new Councilman Espinosa, but really came from neighborhoods saying this is something we want to see addressed. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Madam Secretary, call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'New Ortega Black Eye Clark Eye Espinosa. Eye Flynn. Eye Gilmore. Eye Cashman. High Carnage Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Mental Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_2': '11 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '11 eyes. Council Bill 541 has passed as amended. August 22nd. Before we go to the next public hearing, I'm going to give Councilman Ortega a little bit of privilege and make that announcement. Since you missed the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. If you could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you could stay quiet as you're exiting. I appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I wanted to state that the city's local emergency planning committee, which I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman, 2 seconds. If you're leaving right now, the stairs are closed and you have to take the elevator. Yeah, just letting you know. Okay. Councilman Ortega.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Can we ask you all to leave quietly so we can continue conducting our meeting? Thank you. So the announcement that I want to make is that our local emergency planning committee, which is an arm of the Office of Emergency Management for the City of Denver, will be hosting meetings in every council district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first meeting is tomorrow evening at 615 at the La Alma Rec Center in Councilman Lopez's district. And part of what they will be doing is talking to neighborhoods about the emergency preparedness plan that we have for the city, which we are required to update at a minimum of every five years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so this is part of that process where we're soliciting public input for the emergency preparedness plan that we have for the city of Denver. So I just wanted to encourage people to come out. The address of the LA Alma Rec Center is 1325 West 11th Avenue, right next to the Lincoln Park in the Lincoln Park neighborhood'",

    "Preservation Designation for First Unitarian Society of Denver Church.": [
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. My name is Kara Hahn. I'm a senior city planner with Landmark Preservation at Community Planning and Development. This is a landmark designation for 1400 Lafayette Street, the First Unitarian Society of Denver, and this is an owner supported designation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are approximately 6600 properties that have been designated since the ordinance passed in 1967. The owners of the property are aware that it would that if it is designated, it would go through a design review. It would be designated as is, and there would be no required changes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that it would have to go through design review and there would be a demolition would be discouraged of the property. Additionally, though, they know there are benefits to the property. If it is landmarked, they would be eligible for a variety of grants, including a state historical fund grant, which is a 7520 5% match.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They would also be eligible for historic preservation, rehabilitation, tax credits. And so even though they are a nonprofit, if there's any part of their entity that is income producing, they would be eligible for the state commercial tax credits, which for projects under $2 million would be 25% and capped at $1,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The applicant submitted an application in May. City staff reviewed it and found that it met all the requirements. It went before the Landmark Preservation Commission as well as Council Committee and is currently here at the Second Reading Community Planning and Development posted all of the notifications, toured the property and has been in contact with the applicants throughout'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the process. So what we're looking at is that at the corner of 14th and Lafayette, the applicant is the First Unitarian Society of Denver. And within Blueprint Denver, it is an area of stability. The Church was initially constructed by the Plymouth Congregational Church in 1893 and then completed in 1899 after they had recovered from the silver crisis'",
        "'speaker_7': '. The First Unitarian Society was established in the early 1870s and they occupied many buildings before they found another building of their own. They were oftentimes considered too progressive or too liberal, and they couldn't find housing of their own.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They finally built a building in 1873, and this property, which they moved to in 1958, is their third building. The only primary change that has occurred since then is there was a major fire in 1985 that did some significant damage to the interior of the building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In order for something to be designated a landmark, it has to retain integrity. Meet one criteria out of the following three categories History of architecture and geography and the relate to a historic context or theme in Denver history.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This property has excellent integrity. There are a few minor changes that have occurred an enclosure in the 1920s, a response to the 1985 fire with some changes to the interior and exterior, as well as the changes to the addition of an ADA ramp.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then in the early 2000, in the mid 2000, they added an elevator. Overall, the property has excellent integrity. The property has direct association with the history and development of the city and county of Denver. Typically, they provided space for historically marginal, marginalized groups that couldn't find a space for themselves.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They were very active in the civil rights movement and became a home for the local Congress of Racial Equality. They were very involved in the fair housing movement. They had a free pulpit that allowed other groups to come in and speak when they couldn't find access to something.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then they were heavily involved in the gay rights movement and marriage equality. They held events for other churches. The NCC Church often met here, and then they were heavily involved in the gay coalition of Denver, which started in the mid 19, early 1970s, and they provided space for this group.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It then morphed into the Gay and Lesbian Community Center and now is just currently what is the center. They also hosted a variety of weddings in 1975, which was one of the first gay weddings that was held within the within the nation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this would be the first LGBT site within the state of Colorado that would be designated as historic on either the local, state or national level. So community planning in development is very excited to be able to put something forward that isn't just the history of the wealthy doctor on the corner or the fancy, you know, the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'fancy Victorian house, but really speaks to all members of our community. The property is also associated with a persons of importance or influence on society, including Governor Lam, as well as his wife, Lady Dottie, Liam and also Helen Walcott, who is significant in the civil rights movement and was very involved with the Congress of Racial Equality and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'specifically with unfair housing practices and working it for that. Additionally, it is significant under architecture for its Richard Sony in Romanesque style. Its seen in the Ashland Masonry, which is basically the square masonry, the rounded arches, the cross gables and the parapets.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is also significant for the work of a master architect or a master builder or a recognized architect. And in this case, it's for both of those. For Ernest Varian and Frederick Sterner, who are well-known local architects, as well as for a master builder.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In this case, it's the Walk in stained glass studio. This the stained glass was created in 1893 by Clarence Watkins, and then the 1985 fire severely damaged it. So Clarence's great grandson recreated the stained glass window from the original drawings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And finally, it's significant for its geography. It has a prominent location on the corner of 14th and Lafayette, and it's a very highly recognizable building. Members of the congregation often speak that when they're giving directions to someone and they're like, Oh, it's that castle building on on 14th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's really very community. The community's familiar with it and it's a wayfinding us building. So the property relates to late 19th century architecture, the development and growth of Denver, specifically the Capitol Hill area, and for its role in the social justice movements within the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At the Landmark Preservation Public Hearing, we had received a letter from the original congregation that was signed a petition as well as three emails of support, and then the application included a letter from the current owners. All were in support of this application.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Landmark Preservation Commission evaluated the building and felt that it maintained integrity, that it met all three of the criteria under history, architecture and geography, and that related to the historic context or themes of Denver history. The LPC voted unanimously six zero to recommend designation of the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. All right. We have three speakers. I'm going to call them all up right now, Karen, Derrick Davis, Susan Robertson and John Olson. Susan Roberts in here. Oh, yeah. Great. Yeah. All right. And then Jonathan. So, Karen, you can go first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. I know that Kara just told you just about everything about our church, but I am here as a congregant of the church. And one of the reasons I am so proud to be a member of that church is because of our social justice activities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's we have extensive history of social action. And for decades we've been at the forefront of local and national issues. We have many firsts. Kara mentioned a few. One that we're really proud of is we were integrally involved in one of the first well, the first charitable organization in Colorado, Pioneer Ladies Aid Society, which was led by'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a member of our church, Augusta Tabor. And there's a landmark downtown for her and the location of our congregation at the time of that. Women's suffrage also was a thing that she was involved in while she was a member of our church, which at that time was called Unity Church.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were, as Karen mentioned, one of the first churches, the first church in Colorado to conduct gay weddings and one of the first in the nation, first home of many organizations that currently we now take for granted, like the center.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we actually are the first church in Colorado to achieve Energy Star rating. So we really try very hard to walk our talk and live our values. We're really excited about being the first landmark that's recognized for LGBTQ activism.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's something that we've been very involved with the civil unions. And I was remembering with Susan when we first started doing the standing on the side of love services on the Capitol steps. It started out with about ten, 15 people and wondering what was going to happen with it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then civil unions passed and we have hundreds of people that come and now we actually are changing to standing on the side of love is now our focus is on other issues like Black Lives Matter and immigration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our congregation explicitly decided to remain on Capitol Hill rather than moving. And we want to improve our building and take care of it and make it restore it back to its beauty, shining beauty in Capitol Hill. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Soaps. Karen, can you come back up here and just state your full name for the record?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Karen, Derek Davis. Perfect. And Councilman Brooks as my councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Good to see you. All right. Susan Robertson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for having us here. And I want to thank you on behalf of our entire congregation for considering this proposal. This effort to secure landmark designation for our church was really a long process for our church. We went through a lot of sort of community meeting process and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We ended up with a near unanimous vote. Only one person in our entire congregation voted against it. So I come tonight representing all those people and also representing the first Plymouth Church, which is now located over at Hampton and Carter Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they have we have the strong support of their congregation as well. They occupied the building from 1893 until 1958, and it was very fun to go see their archives. And we actually learned a lot about the early history of our building from them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's very interesting. The educational process that we went through in exploring our history was really, I think, something that empowered us as a congregation. And I think some people knew some of the history, but I think it's become much more a central focus to really try to bring that history alive.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so, for example, nowadays when we're working on Black Lives Matter, we can do that sort of rooted in the history that our congregation was actively leading efforts during the 1960s and Denver to make sure that that African-Americans could be hired at places like Safeway and King Soopers in the Denver Dry Goods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it's really empowering for the the work that we're doing today to understand, you know, where we've all come from and the importance of all that. We also in the 1970s, we hosted a variety of organizations in our basement and in buildings adjoining us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there were organizations such as the National Organization of Women, the American Civil Liberties Union metric, Metropolitan Community, Church of the Rockies. Even organizations like Community College of Denver that first started out in the basement of our church.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we really are very proud of all the organizations that were incubated in our space, the historic well, the current uses of our building. I think a couple of things too that are really important is that our building is currently used for many social justice issues, such as housing homeless populations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We host House to Populations of People Women, Women's Homeless Initiative every other Friday night and family promise for 7 to 10 nights every quarter. So there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who have been housed in our building, fed in our building and volunteer hours that support those people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The historic landmark application. Our process well designation will certainly help us to access the state historic funds, which we feel are really important because we are working to preserve our building and we need to make some repairs that are really important to a beautiful stonework on the outside and so forth, which is failing at this point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we are planning to access the historic grants, but we also feel that it's important at this point to help raise awareness of some of the social justice issues that we're so proud of. We're excited to have the recognition for LGBT, and we feel like this is a great public venue to really bring that history alive'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So all that said, we are very grateful for your support and it's been a wonderful opportunity to go through this process and work with your staff. And we thank you for it all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Can you state your name for the record?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Susan Bridges Robertson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. John Olsen. Last but not least.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Last but not least. My name is John Olsen. I'm director of preservation programs at Historic Denver. I'm here to fully support this designation of the First Unitarian Church at 14th and Lafayette. I'm very proud to be working with this group.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this is a group that is completely invested in their property, in their neighborhood and the state they've been around dealing with the many social issues that we've talked about women's suffrage, civil rights, gay rights, immigration reform, all different kinds of things, including bless you, including the the many social activities that are happening right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they have made just a concentrated effort to really make this their home. And because this is their home, they're very proud of their home. And they have talked through their full congregation about how they could reinvest in their property yet again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the first steps was to recognize the history that this property had for the city, for the state of Colorado, as well as for them as a congregation, and for all of the many people that need this building to continue the social services that are in there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to, you know, commend them on all of their amazing effort, the effort that they've done with the LPC to get this done. And I hope that you will vote for the designation of this property. One of the great benefits of the designation, if this were to pass, which I very much hope that it does'",
        "'speaker_3': ', is the grants that are out there for buildings like this so that they can have the improvements to make all of these social programs happen. And we're very hopeful that this is a grant that's going to be approved by the state historical fund so that they can continue their work there and do all of the things that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really make this neighborhood in this city special. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, John. Questions. This concludes our speakers questions by members of council. Seeing none comments councilman do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, districting has the largest percentage of historic structures and districts and we're so proud of of what what you're all doing to help preserve. And this this building is a perfect example of what's going on in district ten and how the need to preserve that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's a beautiful building. I love those stained glass windows and it's just gorgeous. And I'm looking forward to the improvement and the expansion of service programs. So thank you so much for working so hard to do this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and John, thanks for your leadership and appreciate all that you're doing for historic preservation in District ten. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. You and I'm going to close that public hearing because I should have done that before you spoke council counsel that that's the public hearing for council. Well. 566 Councilman Espinosa. Sorry. So the architecture of the building is impressive and undeniable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what's more impressive is the history. And there's no way of. For me anyway. As an architect. No. To know that history. Just by looking at the building. And so. But it makes me very proud to know what sort of things were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Were originated there and had go on there. Because those are important important things to be ahead of and be part of. For this society to move forward progressively. And so the only thing I just wanted to throw out in my commentary was this this idea that something you should consider is partnering with a nonprofit and looking at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the Denver Arts and venues piece You Are Here grant program because I think it's a real opportunity to bring awareness to that history, that legacy and that the work continues and to sort of that passers by just not only recognize it and it's great architecture, but actually there's a prominent, important piece of Denver history socially that has'",
        "'speaker_0': 'gone on here so that programs out there, that grant deadline is the end of September. Something to think about is you've got a lot of right away there. Maybe there's something creative that can be a temporary installation. So look into that program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's a great opportunity to sort of bring what we was just presented to us and which is summarized in beautifully in the write up to bring some notion of that so that people who are driving by or passing by or walking by or biking by can actually go, whoa, this is this happened here, and the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'work still continues. So it's totally an aside, but I just know that I'm greater for having heard it and maybe others would be too. So thank you. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I really look forward to supporting this designation. I've been in the building any number of times over the years, but I've driven down 14th Avenue thousands and thousands of times since 1971 and never failed to look over at that building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's a beautiful structure. I mean, it is this is one of those designations that in any number of ways is pretty easy. I would designate the building if it your congregation didn't exist and I would designate your congregation if the building didn't exist.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It truly is. It's special to to have the opportunity to recognize what goes on within the building. And yeah, I could talk on for hours, so I'll just say thank you for what you do. And I will support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. I just, you know, couldn't resist chiming in affordable housing and LGBT rights. I always knew those two things went together. But seriously, recently, we had a very tragic incident in Orlando. And right around that time, I had the privilege of being at the Stonewall Inn, which was the first major LGBT national'",
        "'speaker_6': 'landmark that was designated. And I think this is a really important bookend to that in some ways. I mean, the LGBT community for many years. Bars were a place where, you know, they could we could commune and find fellow travelers and, you know, sometimes be safe, sometimes not so safe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think that, you know, those stereotypes, too, about, you know, the beer community. And I think that having a faith community also being designated and I think not just because of perhaps LGBT folks who may have been attending, but because I would imagine then and maybe still now because of the straight allies who took up the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'fight. And it's funny what I always notice when I drive by because I drive by, you know, almost every day on my way to and from Park Hill is that the Black Lives Matter sign? It's one of the few Black Lives Matter signs that I see outside of northeast Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's always noticeable to me and it almost feels more significant. And so that that that theme of being an ally. Right. So again, you know, it is you know, the architecture is amazing, but I want to just thank you for for being that voice as as whether it's with members of those communities or as allies.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I will happily support this designation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Canady, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I still remember the very first time I ever saw this building, and it stuck with me because it was so striking. And, you know, I think my colleagues have said everything so well that I wish I could just say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that, too, I think that the significance of the building, the significance of the history, there are so many things that we do in this job and a year and still getting used to the whole gamut that that runs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to have the opportunity to have a vote in this is really something that's very special for me to be a part of that. So thank you for all the work. I know it wasn't easy to bring it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's one of those stories and structures, as Councilman Cashman, I think, captured when he said it, that you kind of look at it, you're like, wait, that's not already protected. That's not already designated. But, you know, there are structures like that in our city, and it takes the hard work and dedication of the people who are there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to bring this forward and to provide that. And so we are all in your debt, and I'm just so excited and honored to be a part of it tonight. So thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilman Clarke. I'll just I'll just add this, that all of our city, we have a huge problem in CPD because there are congregations that are dying and we're going to, you know, folks want to come in and redevelop and redevelop the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as a person of faith, it's a little sad to see. But this congregation here is so alive and so passionate about what's going on in the city and it's so encouraging to see. So just thank you guys for sharing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And hopefully you can be an encouragement to some other communities of faith to to get involved and be socially active. I know we're talking about a building here, but what makes this building beautiful is the people inside it and who are alive and have a historical way of doing that.'",

Again, kind of reiterate what I might have spoken in the Charter and Governance Committee meeting, which is that I really appreciate the current OEMs offers. Not only are they extremely knowledgeable, they're forward thinking, they're progressive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think their recommendations and policy recommendations reflect this. I also think they do something.'",
