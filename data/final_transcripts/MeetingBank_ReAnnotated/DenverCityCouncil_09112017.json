        "'speaker_11': 'So, you know, that project has been a catalyst. It also raises some some challenges that some of us have have worked on and talked about. And that's the issue of railroad safety and the fact that we've got a lot of development that comes through there where we have our railroads.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Like a new car, a new house and whatnot. Globally. We have all been engraved in our minds that the American dream is opportunity for prosperity and success. But what good does this definition serve us if we sit on the wings of the people who cross borders, who cross seas across mountains, to come to a country where they'",

We are a country of immigrants. We are all immigrants. We all immigrated to different countries, different continents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why? To search for a better life, a better education. And most of all, to search for our dreams. Crossing the border for me was not only crossing the border between Mexico and the United States, it was also crossing the mental border inside of me as undocumented immigrants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All of us knew the consequences of coming to a country where one single piece of paper was the difference between you and me. Reassured ourselves that we would hide in the shadows, that we would hide under the words of the people that judge us day and night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It took me a long time to find my voice. But by the help of a friend of mine, Ethan McNamee, whom we rest in peace, I find the voice inside of me. I found my courage. And more or less, I found my pride.'",

I understand that we find ourselves in our current situation because immigration laws and policies were not followed oftentimes by our parents. Many of us were not aware or could not fully grasp that concept, and it occurred in my situation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For example, I was only five years old. I do not blame my parents, however, because a parent's love for a child will drive them to great lengths in order to give the children a better chance of life. Understand the current immigration laws are complex and lengthy.'",

Those who are willing to sacrifice the best years of their youth to give their children opportunities in life that they never had. Those who contribute to the domestic economy and prevent further offshoring.'",

I thank them for their strive and sacrifice because the only time I ever saw them do was get up every day and come home exhausted, sometimes well into the night.

        "'speaker_3': 'Applying to higher education, as difficult as it is, becomes even more difficult. There's no financial aid from the government. Access to scholarships is extremely limited. You can't even apply for a job. And that's the realities that many are facing now and will face in the next six months as they get ready for graduation.'",

Thanks to the support I have received, I graduated with an MBA and I am currently chasing my dreams and I'm proudly working and paying taxes thanks to Dakar.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When Dakar was issued, many of us step forward and place our trust in the American people. We understood that Daka did not grant us any legal status or federal benefits, but we were presented with the opportunity to contribute to our communities and step out of the shadows.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we grasped it. We paid the fees, and we gave up information about every detail of her life to be inspected by government officials who would decide if we get a driver's license, apply to school, apply for a job, and live under the laws of society as best as we could.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dacca was never a permanent solution. As the name implies, the ultimate decision was simply deferred. And we knew that everything we had worked for could be stripped from us at any moment. This is more apparent now than ever before.'",

We're simply asking for an opportunity to study, to work, to pay our taxes, to be productive members of society, to serve and protect, to be coaches, doctors, nurses, lawyers, construction workers, ultimately to give back and earn a place among the community and the country we have grown to love.'",

So in that note, I just wanted to advocate for an actual community benefits agreement, which is something that we don't have with the neighborhood between the neighborhood and then this forming authority.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the reason that we don't have it is because we didn't have the authority yet, but we are about to. So we would like to see that included. I'd actually like to see it as part of the framework agreement where it talks about the CAMI Investment Fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It should also talk about a community benefits agreement just like this framework agreement will create trust and will create commitment and people know what they're getting into that would do that with the community as well. It would also bring intentionality, goals and commitments around local hire, around open space, around access to the university.'",

In order for this to happen, those families should have access to the university thinking about use of facilities, commercial kitchen use, thinking about affordable housing and you know, are we at time?'",

Really appreciate all of your words. We are. This concludes the kind of the comment portion we're going to go into questions and I'm going to ask the first'",
        "'speaker_1': 'question to get things started, because I don't think we got a chance to outline this correctly. Kelly Lead and call. Jen will burn up and just ask you all to outline all of the changes that happened in those four meetings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Come on up here. In those. In those four meetings that we had, much similar to like we did the other night. Okay, very helpful. Just for so that all the is on the same.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absolutely. As a couple. Oh. Hi. I'm General Moore and I'm an assistant city attorney. And I actually if you want me to, we'll just go ahead. Just point out the actual language changes. Okay. So, as you know, I think all of you have been briefed and have had the agreement in your hands for a few weeks now'",
        "'speaker_5': '. During the CAC meetings that we attended, what we heard was some concern about representation on the board for the neighborhood. And then also we we talked considerably about the use, utility and importance of the Community Investment Fund that was that was included in the original agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we made a couple of changes to address some of the issues that we heard, and I'll just walk through those one by one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kelly walked through the non-voting member, so you can skip that one. But the other the other pieces that you changed would be good to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Skip the non-voting member as I watched this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Yeah. He already went over that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Okay. Sure. Yep. So we've added the non-voting director and we've talked. And Kelly also mentioned that that non-voting director will take the place of the voting director. So really the other substantive change since LUDI is that we've added a little bit of discussion about how the importance of the Community Investment Fund, and that's found significantly in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'two places on page 64 in the this is in a Section 12 about the Community Investment Fund. We added a sentence that says further, the authority shall explore and where appropriate, pursue other funding options and or partnerships annually to supplement funding that is generated from the round up and to increase the benefits of the Community Investment Fund'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to the neighborhood. So that's found there. And then the other place that that is mentioned is in. Sorry, give me just a second. I've got the wrong page here. It's in the first meeting of the board. Okay. And then on page 16 under, there's a there's a section that outlines what the what the board should do in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'its initial meeting. And we have added to to that section the idea that the the Chairperson shall convene the initial meeting of the board and the Board shall consider the initiation of the development of including consideration of funding sources for the Community Investment Fund, so that we make it really clear that the Community Investment Fund needs to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'be a priority of the board and that they have to address the creation of that fund and its funding at their very first meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Any anything else? Any of substance. Okay. And just to point out, just to make it very clear to folks in the public, these four meetings were suggestions by the community to place in the contract. So the contract was actually amended from the Luti meeting till today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so those are some amendments that were happening. Kelley.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kelley Lead Executive Director, Mayor's Office International. 11. that I would also add, you know, from the very origination of the original document when we started talking about the community investment fund is what's unique is a couple of things, but in particular is that one, the only role for the authority is to act as the fiscal agent, so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they would collect the funds and then those would be held as a fiscal agent. We've been very clear and actually are looking forward to and Tim Santos, who's the executive director of the North Democrats from Collaborative, has agreed to help facilitate, among others, a discussion with the community about now how do we organize the global response to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a community to prepare themselves for the receipt of these funds? And what's the right representation beyond just the Citizens Advisory Committee to talk about what programs, what projects? And we've heard a lot tonight among the speakers about different things that need to be funded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is truly a blank canvas for the community to determine how they want to use these funds, and it will evolve over time. So that's a point that has been with us from day one about this. And I think speaking on behalf of Paul Andrews and others, you know, we've talked about how could we accelerate this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sooner? And I think that's the next round of discussions about how we move the community investment fund sooner well before the building start.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. And just one quick question to I don't see Terrence Carroll, but I see Maria Garcia Berry. The ongoing meetings of the CAC, once this authority is formed, will the CAC continue to meet? Because there is a community person saying that, how will they continue to be informed?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So the CAC has been meeting once a month since August of 2013, September 2013. It is the intent and the mayor's agenda for the first authority meeting that the Citizens Advisory Committee should be considered as the permanent advisory committee to the authority.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's our intent. We've been talking to a lot after the last meeting that we had Terence and myself and Liz Adams, who also works with us. We've been talking to a lot of the committee members and on the meeting on the 28th, which is our September meeting, even though we've had four meetings, we still have one more'",
        "'speaker_5': 'meeting in September. That is the topic of discussion is how do we position ourselves, what do we need to do to better structure ourselves, to have better accountability, to make sure that everybody understands everything that the CAC is doing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do a pretty robust mailing and notification to people who just sign up to get the information. And what's amazing is over two thirds of the committee has been meeting regularly for over four years. They show up every month and we get a lot of attendance, a good attendance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we'll be talking about that on the 28th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. All right. Thank you, Miss Berry. All right. Rafael Espinosa. Councilman Espinosa. Okay. I guess for the two that are closest to the microphone, how many how many directors are coming from the state? I mean, are assigned by the state of Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Zero.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How many?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But there but the state portion of this project is 100 and 117 to 120. Now, $120 million, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's 121.5 million is what's coming from what you're referencing is the Regional Tourism Act application, which was adopted or approved by the State Economic Development Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the cash portion for the National Western Stock Show is that is how much?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's 50 million in cash and then 75 million inland. So $125 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How many directors are they getting to? And then the University of Colorado also gets to direct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The University of Colorado is not represented at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Colorado State University. Sorry, Frank. Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hey, notice how I stood up for you, Tony?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He is not happy and not coming back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a rebuttal from the Chancellor? So, CSU. So the state is so there in the agreement. There are dollars actually through the House bill 1344, there was 250 million approved by the state legislature. 50 million is for facilities supporting facilities in Fort Collins.'",
        "'speaker_3': '200 million are coming to this campus for three facilities and they have two seats on the board.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So $120 million, zero seats, $50 million and 90 acres of land. Two seats, I mean, zero seat, 217. Two seats at $50 million and 90 acres and two seats for $16 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you clarify that? Where are you coming up with the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what was the what did you say, the current state house?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, sure. So House Bill 1344, which was adopted in the state in early 15, was 250 million. 50 million goes up to Fort Collins for supporting facilities. 200 million comes to the campus for three facilities that will be built at the National Western Center, a state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tax revenue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'CLP Certificates of participation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're going to sell those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, that's for the state. Determine how what they use as collateral for those. But ultimately through the Secretary of State, she will represent the state in the sale or use of those funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to now suggest that that is $330 million of state money or $317 million of state money with with just the two representatives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let me let me just clarify. So the RTA money don't count, the 121.5 million is paid over 36 years. So that's paid out of an increment that will be paid over drips and drabs over the course of 36 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what we need right now, though, is the construction is now and the actual value of that state money is substantially less. It will have to be pledged in a certain way and it will be worth a lot less than 121.5 million because we need it for construction today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My my point there my point that I'm trying to get at is we paid $168 million for Coors Field, divided over six counties. We paid $250 million for Mile High Stadium, divided over six counties. And every single one of those counties got equal representation with two state people on those that district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And now we're now Denver's portion. Just Denver's portion is $673 Million.'",
        "'speaker_3': '$622,000,622.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Million. So basically those two are portion more than our portion on those other two projects combined doubled or tripled. And the community here is asking for two seats. Why was that so difficult? Because I know that the mayor gets six appointments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, have we gotten a commitment from the mayor's office that we're going to get actual neighborhood people as part of those six appointments that somehow justifies excluding them because.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So a couple of points. One, you know, this is as far as I know, and I worked on the football stadium project. This is the first entertainment facility, public entertainment facility that actually has neighborhood representation as a voting member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I cannot I'm not aware of any other facility in the city in county of Denver that has a resident or residents that are impacted by a project as a voting member. That's one to is. You know, again, if you think about the original term at 50 years with the ability to extend for two additional 25 year terms'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for a 100 year deal, one of the things that the mayor wanted to make sure, because obviously mayors will change over that hundred years, is that there was always going to be an assurance in the framework or the makeup of this board that at least one community representative would be a voting member of the of that body'",
        "'speaker_3': 'based on conversations with the community. And this was actually a really one of many good conversations, was this idea of adding a non-voting member that would be also at these meetings so that if there was a vacancy of the neighborhood, that this non-voting member could step in and actually be a voting member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there's always continuity of a vote among the members. And again, the last piece I would reference in Crystal or Jen can jump in here is the mayor has has six other appointments. But what was important here was being very clear that the neighborhoods always had a representative that could vote on behalf of the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that could have been one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could have been two, could have been eight members of the community. That is up to you guys to make that determination. And while there would likely be sort of homogeneity or sense of mean consensus in in any of those agencies, the stock show people, the university system, there is no there there is more there's less homogeneity in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our communities. We could have that appoint that single appointment could be somebody that has been a long term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Member of that community or a short term member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of that community, rather than having representation from a cross-section. That just adding one additional member could add. So, you know, instead what we're doing is we're asking the mayor to just focus on that. Let's focus on the question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can get to those comments in the comments portion, but just get to a question on them for this portion. Thank you. So is the then for you, Crystal? Has the mayor committed to one of his six, two of his six or some portion of his six appointments to being members of this community that live within the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'boundaries of global Elyria in Swansea.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So good evening everyone. My name is Krystal Torres de Herrera. I am the deputy city attorney. It is my pleasure to be here today to answer these questions. Councilman Espinosa, I really appreciate the question, and it's obviously something that we've talked about at each of these meetings that we've had with our community members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to answer your question, but I also want to highlight some other information that was shared in these meetings, because I think it helps out to frame this discussion as well. One of those is that in addition to the document and the changes that we made, we also shared some additional documents with the Citizens Advisory Committee'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we thought would be helpful. One of those was a letter that the mayor has drafted for the future board members of the authority, and that letter details his expectations for this authority board in terms of how they're going to interact with the community and how they are going to honor and be able to make sure that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there is always that relationship and understanding and conversation with with the community. I think that was very important as we talked about with these discussions. Even for those folks who have concerns about this agreement, I think it was really helpful for them to see that that this is an expectation for all of the the board members that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the mayor is appointing here. I would also point out that city council is also going to be approving each of the mayoral appointees. These are folks who will come back in front of all of you. Also, the mayor has asked the Citizens Advisory Committee to give him feedback on the attributes that they think are important in these'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and these appointments to say, hey, these are really important appointments. I want to hear directly from you what you think is important, what are the perspectives they should have? What are the qualities I need to be looking for?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And President Burks, as you know, while you were at that meeting, President Brooks generously made the offer to the community members that he has a standing meeting with the mayor every Tuesday and that he was going to be bringing when the community was ready, a group of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Folks to meet with the mayor and to say at that end, to have that time to talk to him about, hey, we understand that you're going to be appointing a community member, but you also have these other appointments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's have that conversation. Let's talk about that. I really appreciated the dialog from the community that we had around that meeting and the fact that the community was very thoughtful about wanting to get their ducks in a row, wanting to spend some time together as a group and figuring out what those attributes are, what they really wanted'",
        "'speaker_2': '. There was a lot of conversation about business owners versus residents and people who had a longstanding impact in the community. So all of that was also part of the discussions and I think really helpful to really frame what these conversations look like and the path forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So understanding that that process is still unfolding. We anticipate that as that meeting happens, as the community comes forms with comes forward with the attributes that we will be having those conversations as we move forward together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, the real unfortunate thing in that response was, I mean, we had a proclamation tonight about DOCA. You know, the mayor's letter does not have the gravitas of having it in the authority agreement in this foundational document. If we had the difference between having a director a position assigned to the community versus a commitment that can change'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with any mayor. That can change with whoever the president is that there's no guarantee that District nine is represented. I mean, is the president of this council. So while right now I feel like we're in a good place, why wouldn't we just memorialize that for this community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now and forever?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I may, just for the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Next hundred years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Comments. Number one, there is a representative that's a voting director that is in the document. There is also a gas resident that is a non-voting director who will be at every single board meeting who will have access to executive session.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The only other non-voting director is this city's then CFO at the time. That's really powerful because you then have two people who are there who have access to the same amount of information that not even voting director has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The exact same access to information will be able to have all that at the same exact time. I think it's helpful to then have those two people be out, be able to go back and talk to the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to make it clear that both the nonvoting director, they both have the same access to the meetings and the information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the non-voting member have proxy if the voting member is not present.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Exactly. And that was the thought behind it, because and I'd like to give a a shout out and credit for spotting that. That was something that was very important to us. Is that because this representative needs to be a community person, there's no one else on that board who can jump in and in at a moment of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a vacancy. And so it really needed to be somebody from the community who understands the community to play that role. And it wouldn't be fair if somebody wasn't up to speed and aware of all the conversations and contacts that was happening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that is why we did the non-voting member, because we absolutely wanted someone else from the community to be there to have that same info and be able to step in in the moment of vacancy to address the community's concerns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to jump in here and just clarify one thing. If we added a this is the question. If we added a voting member, you'd be at 12, correct? Correct. An even number. Okay. So there would have to be a whole shift in the in the makeup of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, Councilman, are you. One last question. It doesn't need necessarily to be in this agreement, but is there any discussion at all about a patent rights clause if we're talking about becoming the Silicon Valley of of of AG, you know, I imagine we would be generating some sort of great ideas that, you know, with this level of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'investment. I mean, the entirety of the infrastructure is ours. Is there some sort of discussion about patent rights clauses?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. I mean, there there's not in this specific agreement. And I think, you know, one of the things that we should references once the authority board is or the authority is activated and stood up, they then become a signatory to this agreement as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that will be a conversation among the CSA in particular. And, you know, we spent a lot of time and Gretchen in particular has led our next generation agribusiness work, along with the Office of Economic Development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we need that authority in place. And my guess would be once the authority is up and running, we are moving forward on our next generation. AG We're working with cashew issue on programing that may include a whole range of things around innovation is that there will be a whole nother round of agreements that will emerge, but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we really need that authority up and running in order to have those conversations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I mean, it depends on a whole bunch of what happens in the future that we cannot predict. That's good. That might be a resource for to help stem any sort of future decline. Right. I mean, we don't expect this to decline.'",
        "'speaker_1': '100 years is a long time, though, and things change. So. Okay, great. Great. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Crystal, if you wouldn't mind coming back to the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For you, Councilman. Anything?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. I don't have the document in front of me that you had passed out that highlighted the mayor's commitments or expectation from the board members. Can you can you remember what some of them are? I know one of them was a commitment to the Community Advisory Committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely. And, you know, we were getting a copy just right now, and I'd be happy to have that in front of me while we speak.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That would be awesome. I think it's important to just highlight what those expectations are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perfect. And and just so everyone is clear, this is a letter that the mayor would submit to the end of it, to the authority chairperson and to the members of the board, which highlights several key things, which, as I alluded to earlier, but really at the forefront saying what is the purpose of this letter?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is to protect and to understand the valuable role that all three of these neighborhoods have played historically on this campus and will continue to play. And to that end, in an effort to having the authority integrate within these communities, he is proposing the following.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So as part of the overall onboarding. All members of the NWC board and staff shall receive copies of the adopted neighborhood plans, including any amendments, and should be conversant as to the important relationship between the National Western Center campus, its operations and the adjoining neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The authority and it originally said should and we're going to change it to well will cooperate with or initiate efforts to develop a local talent pipeline for jobs on or around the NWC campus with an emphasis on talent development for students in the girls neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Such programs may include mentoring, internships, apprenticeships, work study or other similar programs. The board and again this said should and we're changing it to well, the board will actively engage the NWC Citizens Advisory Committee, which was established by the National Western Stock Show in the fall of 2013, or any successor organization to create a direct dialog between'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the future campus and the neighborhood representatives. I would also encourage the authority to engage the many community nonprofits, schools, arnault's and businesses in the region. Another one. To the extent possible, NWC board meetings should be held in the as neighborhoods to provide area residents, nonprofits and business owners direct access to members of the board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Board meetings should include an opportunity for public comment. And then finally and again, this is one more change. We are changing a will should to will. The board will provide easy access to public documents in both electronic and printed formats, as well as in English and Spanish.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would also point out, Councilwoman Ortega, as you know, because you were at the meeting along with Council President Brooks, but there was also discussion from the community, NOLA and others about a community benefits agreement and that I made a commitment that I would raise that issue with the mayor and I will see him later this week'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and we will discuss that as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when we come back next week, you may be able to give us an update of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. My next question is for Kelly Lead and Kelly. Can you tell us what the additional documents are that would come before this body for approval as part of the National Western Center?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. So the mayor's office of the National Western Center, which is a creation of the mayor and is housed actually in the Webb building right now, is charged on behalf of the city. We're acting as the city's owners rep, and that's a term of art for the design and construction business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But in essence, anything related to where there's an expenditure of city funds. The Mayor's Office of the Western Center, most likely in collaboration with public works, which would be our procurement arm, will put forward two two city council design and construction contracts that in terms of executing this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So anything that hits the threshold, the 500,000 threshold would come before this body for review and approval.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the document that you've been referring to, I kept calling it some kind of book, which in my mind is the blue book, but I don't think that's what we call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our baseline.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Baseline.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Book. Okay. Is that a document that's approved by council?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is not. But what it what it will do is so if you think about the course of the last four years, there's been a lot of documents generated about this project. And what the baseline book does is brings everything together and organizes it into three buckets schedule budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And scope. So all those documents get pulled together into one document. That becomes the document by which our office and the partners now are now measured and schedule is probably the easiest. In fact, the framework agreement starts to lay out some some schedule dates that show, you know, we had always said this was going to be it'd'",
        "'speaker_3': 'take us at least ten years to get these early phases done. We're now showing a schedule that goes faster than those original ten years. But the document, the baseline book will be a document that we will certainly share with council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will be publicly posted. The partners will obviously we'll all use it, but at the end of the day, it's the document by which were measured and we will be providing ongoing reporting to City Council through most likely the Luti Committee, Mary Beth Committee, land use, Transportation Infrastructure Committee around our progress against those targets, just like you've'",
        "'speaker_3': 'seen in better Denver.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So, so just to be clear, it's primarily the construction contracts that will come to count design.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Design and construction.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Half a million. So any of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The and and we still have finance, you know, we've only issued the first tranche of finance, the first 200 million. So we have additional tranches of finance that will come before this body as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And just to be clear about the ongoing existence of the community, but community a community advisory committee. Is so important because of the ongoing issues. So once the I-70 construction starts, we'll see some of the same activity begin to happen at National Western.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So circulation and you know, which bus routes are going to be changed and which streets are going to be closed and all of that kind of stuff, the emergency access to the neighborhood. So that ongoing dialog with the community where those conversations both with National Western and the NBCC and obviously will see that contractor now that's been'",
        "'speaker_11': 'selected becomes a critical part. And I see the CAC kind of playing a vital role in all of that because it represents the three neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And absolutely, in fact, it's a lesson. You know, Marie and I were talking about this not long ago. You know, we worked on the Mile High Stadium project together and we had a similar sort of group. But once we kind of finished our work, the group disbanded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, obviously, that's a single project with a single purpose. This has and you just highlighted the enormous complexity that's before us, not just around the National Western Center, but the surrounding projects. And I think the Citizens Advisory Committee plays a really, really important role in how do we connect and align those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Tim Santos and his team in the NDDC will play an equally important role in kind of connecting all the dots. But you know, and then the last piece I would say is, you know, obviously once the authority board gets up and running, we're going to start the authority board's going to be talking about the operations of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the campus and the programing and having that connection to the community about their interests of their own programing, talking about the impacts for various events. I mean, today most people don't even realize there's well over 200 plus events at the National Western complex today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of them are pretty small and are self-contained. We all we all know the impacts of the National Service talk show.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I was at one of those yesterday. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So I mean, all those things are really referenced. Why it's important that we continue to nurture and involve the Citizens Advisory Committee going forward. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I'm going to save the rest of your comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. And with that, I see no one, no other comments. The public hearing for 939 is now closed and we'll open up to comments by members of the council, and I'll start this being the district I represent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wow. This has been a long time coming in. I was going to say this is kind of the culmination of the two C agreement making good on what the voters approved of. But it came way before that and even came before I came on council in 2011 when the stock show was talking about leaving the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Joe Johns, that beyond just said for 100 years they've been thinking about this day. Velasquez has many generations of parents and family who've been living in the neighborhood with this incredible stock show in and also the hope to be included in its vision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so it feels incredibly it feels awesome to be a part of a night like this. Now, is everything perfect? No. But we're doing something that no other communities has ever done. And at a macro sense, you heard the incredible president out of the wonderful CSU University who has been getting joked on today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's a great guy to really talk about. Feeding the world is the vision, which I think is awesome. But I think for our country, the two regions that don't talk to each other are urban and rural. And we have an opportunity to bring to bridge the urban rural divide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's incredible. There's a lot that I can say tonight. Boy, we could be here all night. But seeing as this is a special night as well, I'm going to save my comments. I have been a part of two of the four meetings with the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been incredible, really trying to see the city. We have equity partners. I know a lot of folks want to just say, hey, change this and change that. We have equity partners. When you have equity partners, you just don't change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're in a a legal agreement. So this is very complex. But the equity partners see the value of the neighborhood. And the equity partners had to approve of the non-voting members, which on the face, everybody says, what is a non-voting member?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think it was just explained very well that there's a lot of value. It's a proxy. It's someone who gets all of the executive information. It's someone who who sits at the table, someone who is allowed to report back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But still with that. I stand with the community and say, you want a second voting member? Okay, let's go meet with the mayor. He has six choices and I stand by that commitment and we are going to have a meeting with the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is what it's going to call from the community is organization. And the other thing that I would say is. It's not just that one member I think you all shits. We should all come together, Councilwoman Ortega as well and say, what are the guidelines?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are asking the mayor to choose from. Not just a pick six. This is in Governor Swansea. This is in District nine. We should set up the guidelines of how we picked a six. But that's going to cause a lot of organization.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I completely support that. But I'm deeply moved by the number of residents, the most the eclectic amount of residents who've come to the table speaking in English and Spanish, representing hundreds of years, representing ten years, saying, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is the right direction. We have some concerns, but let's move forward. Let me tell you right now to have Globeville, Luria, Swansea, come to this podium right now and have general support for this is a miracle. I'm not joking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is a miracle because I've been in the meetings we've talked to and it takes a little bit for us to come together. And so that's big for the community. That's big for the city. That's big for the equity partner issue in the stock show.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just want to thank you all, because this has been one of the most inclusive billion dollar projects that I've seen come through the city. We were just having a conversation about DIA and not being able to really get the information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We wanted it. Sorry, DIA. But it was. It's correct. And you all gave books to everyone. Some of them not opened, but you gave books to everyone on the community saying this is it. What are your thoughts? So I want to thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think this is the biggest test for the community now because there is a lot of there's a huge opportunity at stake. And how are we going to use these resources for the betterment of not just now, but ten years, 20 years, 30 years and all over Elyria.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Swansea. So I emphatically in supporting this. I'm so proud to. Councilman Monteiro. You worked hard. You didn't get to see this day, but you really worked hard to bring it to this fruition. And so I want to thank you for your leadership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One thing, Kelly, the team, the legal team, CSU, the Rams, such a great school and people in the National Western Stock Show effort for coming to the table and saying, you know what? We want to stay in Denver for the next 100 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. All right, next, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just to clarify, Councilwoman Monteiro did get to see this day, just not from the dais.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There you go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks. Want to scare anybody alive and well to say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very good clarification. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sir. I know I was a little bit shook. Yeah, this is really an exciting night. It's. It's a night of great opportunity as well as great challenge. I remember when I was still in the newspaper business and I heard that the National Western was was thinking of moving to Aurora.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What do you what are you talking about? It's the stock show. It's Denver. It can't move to Aurora. And I was heartened when I heard discussions kicking up that maybe that that wouldn't happen. And when the deal started to formulate and the stock show was going to stay, and then and then in discussions, I hear there's there's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'going to be a festival park out there. And the city's been talking about a festival park and how much we need that got a little bit more excited. But it was and I had the opportunity to tell President Frank this a few minutes ago, that a couple of years ago I got the opportunity to attend a dinner'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on the eve of the stock show and and hear Tony Frank talk about the research that could take place on this campus, really going a long way to address hunger around the world and to change the way food production is handled and look at issues of of clean water in the environment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what really got me excited about this project. And yeah, the stock show will be spiffy and new and it'll be great for the next 5000 years, but we really have an opportunity to do some very special stuff there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That being said, 100% support what I hear coming from the community. I think a formal community benefit benefits agreement makes great sense. I think a second voting member is probably doable. I hope I hope that it is. And you know, excuse me, I forgot the neighbors name who who testified, but about having the opportunity for women in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the community to to do a purvey their skills on the site. I'm thinking of something like komal out a taxi where where the Latino women came in, come in and not only prepare spectacular meals, but but learn how to get themselves into the restaurant business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just along with President Brooks, I talk all day about the opportunities it's spectacular project and I still share. A lot of concern that. This has to be done well, or this neighborhood could get beat up along the way more than it needs to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Mr. Lane and his crew have a heck of a job ahead of them. And work hard, sir. Work hard. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa. Crystal. Crystal, thanks for the answers and Kelly as well. And hey, I don't know how that whole conversation manifests itself, but that to me is I'm I'm grateful to know that some member of the community brought that up to your guys's attention and that not only did you respond, but you responded'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in a way that I would have been sitting there if I'd been sitting in that meeting begging for you guys to include. And so hopefully part of the reason why we have a community member and why we have a backup plan and a proxy for that is because, you know, well, Rafael's going to sit there and he's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'going to rail on us, do the so I great answers and thank you for including both you know I will be supporting this because this framework gets the gist right and is better than. Far better than it could have been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate the work that you guys have been doing over these years and more recently since the vote. With regard to community dollars, though, now I think I get frustrated how we hide behind the legal lane that this consortium is operating in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand it, but the fact remains that this whole thing was in part borne out of a willingness by the stock show to leave. You know, bartering. One municipality versus us and essentially abandoning. They would have essentially abandoned Greece with land that was devalued by an elevated highway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And contamination in this city pumped millions into staff and consultants to benefit the stock show directly and the equity partners as well. And we've been pumping those millions through the MDC, the NWC for years, through the planners that we've hired to master planning process, the Globeville process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yeah, there's a community component to all those things, but all of those are advisory. So that's why you keep me hearing me hammer about the community aspects on things that are legally binding. This is where we can actually give the results to the community in the same way we're giving them to the partners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I appreciate the fact when you do get those wins, because this is where they matter the most. We can document and we can put all these things on a piece of paper and a spreadsheet and talk about how we know what this community needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But until we start delivering on them. One member said it best he didn't support. All in faith. So there is a ton of faith in this community in everything that has transpired over the last five years. This framework, though, is the one tool that you need to get going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So just be mindful that you know this this is that next piece and use it. All of you guys, the equity partners, CSU as well, to to to start moving forward on your on your on your initiatives, in your goals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But recognize that all those things you've memorialized. Do what you can to capture them, because this community is desperately wanting needing those issues addressed. Thanks. Thanks. Councilman Espinosa, Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Council president. So I, you know, I've been paying attention to this for quite a while, I think since two C at its birth. And, you know, seeing folks go door to door in the community and hearing overwhelmingly that this is a project that that needs to happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's part of our history. It's part of our heritage. We can go on and on with the two key talking points. But the thing that we had to take away from it the most is every single precinct, this was supported.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a lot of support citywide, and that also comes from the community to have some of the folks I recognize from the community since back in my organizing days and to see them here testifying in support really means a lot to me as well to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let me let me just say this. I think this partnership with the National Western, with CSU, with Denver, I think this is something that only comes along when you have a lot of different people at the table and a lot of commitment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. And and I really appreciate the leadership and it's the willingness to be at the table from Colorado State University. I think it's it's absolutely necessary when we talk about the future of agriculture. Right. Like any other study.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is the best university to do this, right? This is the very principle of CSU. The very roots of it is that in history and I think of the purpose of, you know, well, we all know the purpose of the public body of the government and to, you know, help accomplish the things that we cannot do'",
        "'speaker_9': 'individually. And then I think of the purpose of the university, and that's to be that beacon of knowledge, to provide that research, right, to do that research to teach, but not to keep it behind the ivory walls. Right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The ivory tower. But to bring it out into the community and share it with the public good. The knowledge that we have in whatever institution of higher learning that is the purpose that it serves. And to see that kind of mix together and take place in a community where we absolutely need it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where for three decades, ladies and gentlemen, we've been wanting to see a grocery store. Access to fresh food. There are a lot of things that I think in my day organizing under the Cross Community Coalition with Lorraine Granado is my as one of my mentors and saying there's a lot of work that needs to happen in this'",
        "'speaker_9': 'community and we cannot do it alone and we are going to die not being able to finish it all. That's just how big of a movement this is and how big of an effort we have to have and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That was 15. 15 years ago. And that still has that still continues. This is one of those opportunities that we have an opportunity just to really bring these different folks together, these different organizations, different efforts together to really address this need, not just in the community but in our city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. In this partnership, that takes it to a completely different level. It's a lining of very important stars. And I think, like I said before, it would be a shame if we kept it behind the walls of government for the benefit of government, for the benefit of contractors or whatever our for the behind the ivory walls of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the university just to sit on a shelf and say, this is the study we found with this, you know, our our our one institution. And I think. We all want. Our two confused, Dr. Frank said, are two. Are one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ah, one. I'm sorry. Thank you. I keep mixing that up. The. The, ah, one institution. And I think. What I'm trying to say is. We have the right people at the table. And we have a challenge in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We need to solve this challenge. And we need to start with the community that we are in. My ask and from day one. It's not my. My district, not the neighborhood I was born and raised in. But something that I know has been a big issue that we knocked on a lot of those doors is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let's end that food desert. If it's about if this is what it's about and this is this alignment of the right folks at the table, let's put an end to the food desert out in Greece. And let's do it the right way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let's do it as as this proud woman got up and said. Give us the opportunity to prove who we are to what we're capable of. Right. Those are the community benefits that we're talking about. Of course, you know, there are community benefits that you can write in any agreement and stuff like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we have to make a real commitment because if we can't change the community around us, then we have no business trying to change the world around us. Right. And I think that's going to be, you know, something pivotal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those jobs. Right. The ability to actually put people in those scholarships, banning from from from the stock show. I think that's that's just a critical opportunity. The last thing I'm going to say is that and I and I heard what what someone somebody had said earlier about our culture and in the history of of Western culture.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's something that we don't talk about that we should be. And I think, of course, in silence this poem I am walking. And I think of the fact that the American cowboy and not Western culture comes from us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The people that they point and say, those are not Americans, us. The Aguero's. Americanos, the folks who live in these communities and call this home. We did reveal. That's why it's called Reveal. That vaquero, that culture comes from us, the adobe and our buildings, those bricks that we use that comes from us hundreds of years ago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That corn, that grain comes from our ancestors thousands of years ago. And what a shame. The hundreds of years later, we cannot benefit from it. And I think this is the opportunity for us to actually turn that around, to close that, to close that gap and to finally say, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Your ancestors taught my ancestors a long time ago to survive in this rough Western climate. We are finally going to. We're going to we're going to turn it right back around. And I think that's one opportunity that we have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I've been thinking about this for a while, Dr. Frank, and this has been brewing in my head for a while. I was like, Man, what a what, a what? What an opportunity that we have not just in front of us for the next hundred years, but in front of us for the past 300 for the next'",
        "'speaker_9': '300. And that's the way we should be thinking. So thank you so much. You know, it gives me a lot of proud, a lot of Pride Counseling Council president to to see something like this, an opportunity be created in in Globeville, Larry and Swansea out with the National Western Authority.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'National Western Center Authority. Thank you all for all of your hard work. Everybody in the room, including the community. And I think the Broncos are tied at seven seven.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, I think the CSU team will be looking forward to you taking them out, apologizing for this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hey, man, he was the one that made the silly bet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That wasn't even just Councilman Ortega. Mr. Nice bookend.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I first want to. Extend my gratitude and appreciation to Kelly for the role that you've played in in guiding this project and this process to where we are here tonight. Your leadership has played an important role in bringing the community together and really making sure that all of these issues have been dealt with.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to just list off the names of other people who have been key and active participants in the process. Jen There you are over there. Gretchen Crystal. Pat and Paul from National Western, Tony, Frank from CSU and your staff who have sat in on most of the CAC meetings, all of the residents from the community who'",
        "'speaker_11': 'have participated in the CEC meetings and whether you're a voting member or not, you know, residents from the community have come and made sure that their voice was heard. And I appreciate the discussion at the last three meetings that really moved this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There was, you know, a document handed out to everybody and. You all listen to what the residents were saying and came back with some changes. It wasn't exactly what everybody wanted, but it was significant movement to show there was sincere listening and partnership in this process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Maria and Terence, thank you both for your role as co-chairs of this committee process. I just want to mention that part of the history with National Western in these neighborhoods goes back a long, a long way. And Pat played a very key role in working with the cross-community coalition in helping to raise funds to build the building'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that focus points is now in that was cross-community home in pat. You know I know the community and Lorraine was very grateful for your role in helping bring dollars to the table that they were not successful in attracting on their own.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this partnership continues and the neighbors have been full and active members of this process in ensuring, again, that their their voice was being heard. I also, Councilman Cashman, would like to see that community benefits agreement. It's something that we've talked about from from day one.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's been a part of the conversation with the neighborhood and in Kelly and the process as it's moved along. And there are some things that are in the works that will be part of that community benefits agreement, the roll up, you know, and the conversation about, well, gee, what is that going to generate?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's not going to really be enough for the community to offset the impact that they're going to be dealing with from construction to, you know, traffic to who knows what all those issues might be. But the the fact that the community is an active partner and those issues will be put on the table is part of the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'ongoing existence of the Community Advisory Committee, the fact that there will be representation and I'm committed to sitting in on the meeting with Councilman Brooks and the mayor to advocate for that second voting member, because I think that is important to ensure that that is part of the full participation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, we're not saying add another member to the 11 member board. We're saying one of those six members should be another voting member. So you have equal representation as the other two partners, because I see the community as the third leg of this stool.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The the work that Tim Sanders will be doing as part of the index and helping to bring everybody together to look at standing up that infrastructure, if you will, for what would be the community investment fund beneficiary, if you will, is is really important because it it I see it also tying into part of the conversation with'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the mayor. But it also allows the opportunity for not just whatever could be generated by the complex itself, but there have been conversations about the fact that we still don't have enough money to do the improvements on the 300 homes left within the 500 footprint of the I-70 corridor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, you know, that could be the vehicle to to put some of those dollars into you know, the community has been working on the community land trust to deal with an immediate and real issue these neighborhoods are dealing with today.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's the displacement of families that cannot afford to stay in their own neighborhood. And if we could jump start getting some resources into that fund to try to buy some of those homes and save the houses so that, you know, people can stay in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We know some of those homes are in horrible condition and may be better off being raised than, you know. It'll cost more money to improve them than it will to build something new on those sites. But having control of that land in the community is is going to be really important to addressing so many of the issues'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that are kind of coming at these folks from all different directions, from the construction going on on Brighton Boulevard and what will be happening on the river and I-70 and National Western and how were they going to get in and out of their neighborhood when all of this construction is happening?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's why all of these pieces need to interrelate with one another. It's why the index was created in the first place to ensure that these things aren't all happening in in silos, but they're all working together. I have been an active participant in this process, mostly through my staff person, Susan Aldouri, who has sat in on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'most of these meetings. But I attended the last, I think, three or four of the CCAC where, you know, the conversation has furthered along. And really it's in large part from the residents standing up and saying, this is what we need, this is what we want.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and again, that genuine listening that was part of this process. So I am happy to support this, to move it forward. But I'm committed to the ongoing efforts that need to happen to ensure that the community benefit agreement is in place and that we work towards trying to get that second voting member and making sure that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'this is the world class facility that we've all envisioned it to be. And, you know, I can remember one of my first council meetings in 2011. There were actually it was Councilman Brown and I were talking to colleagues saying we need a letter signed by all 13 council members because by golly, none of us are going to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'let National Western move out of Denver. And so that really was the beginning of the conversations of how do we then look at how we keep them here and what is needed to keep this critical asset that has been part of the history of Denver in the city of Denver and not in Aurora.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Nothing, nothing against our friends in Aurora. But this is a Denver icon. And so it's important that this process move forward to keep this asset here and the relationships and the opportunities that will be afforded to the residents of this community and the broader community as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Last words, it's been moved in. Second amount of secretary roll call.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Clark.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Espinosa. Right. Flynn I friend in Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lopez Hi.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Ortega. Sussman Hi, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I please close the voting. And as a result.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nine eyes or see the grimace? Yes, nine eyes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, you're right. Nine Eyes Council Bill 939 has passed. Congratulations on everybody's hard work. Seeing no other business before this body. We stand adjourned. Go, Broncos.'"
