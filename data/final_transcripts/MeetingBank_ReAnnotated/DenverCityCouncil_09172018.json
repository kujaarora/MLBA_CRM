        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, I'd be happy to. Proclamation number 957, opposing amendment 74 and attempt to amend the Colorado Constitution to drastically limit state and local government regulation at a high cost to taxpayers. Whereas local government services are essential to the citizens of the city and county of Denver.'",

And. Whereas, Amendment 74 declares that any state or local government law or regulation that reduces the fair market value of a private parcel is subject to just compensation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And. WHEREAS, while Amendment 74 has simple language, it has far reaching and complicated impacts. And. Whereas, under the current Colorado Constitution, a property owner already has the right to seek compensation from state or local governments. And. Whereas, Amendment 74 would expand this well-established concept by requiring the government, i.e. the taxpayers, to compensate private property owners for virtually'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And. WHEREAS, Amendment 74 would severely limit the ability of Colorado, state and local governments to do anything that might indirectly, unintentionally or minimally affect the fair market value of any private property. And. Whereas, Amendment 74 would drastically diminish the ability of our state and local governments to adopt reasonable regulations, limitations and restrictions upon private property.'",

Whereas, Amendment 74 would make inherently dangerous or environmentally damaging activities prohibitively costly to attempt to limit or regulate even the interest of the public. And.'",

Whereas, the fiscal impact for similar language in Washington State was estimated at $2 billion for state agencies and 1.5 billion for local governments over the six years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And. Whereas, there were $4 billion in claims in Oregon before the residents repealed the initiative two years after its passage. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver that the Denver City Council oppose Amendment 74 and strongly urges a no.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And at that point in time, I had not really looked at this particular initiative that will be on the November ballot. They did get the signatures. And as I started to look at it and talk with people like the Colorado Municipal League, we actually had them come and speak to our Finance and Government Committee to share their'",
        "'speaker_8': 'concerns also about the broad reaching and indeed significant implications this could have on really gridlock in the day to day work that local and state government does. And so I thought it was important, number one, to bring it forward so that it's another way to educate the public.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We did get very clear direction from our city attorney that on amendments such as this, we do have the authority or the ability to take a position. And I just want to strongly encourage my colleagues to to vote for this proclamation tonight, encouraging the voters to vote no when they see it on the ballot in November.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This this initiative, this measure is a killer for the communities ability to regulate land use in their own backyards. The. Determination of fair market value is not really a science so much as an art.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so actually sometimes it feels like a dart game throwing darts at the dartboard. I recall when Land was being acquired for Denver International Airport back in the late eighties early nineties, there were wild, wild estimates of what constituted fair market value, the largest parcel box elder farms that the city had offered about $30 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The owners wanted 90 million and they were eventually awarded 56 million. And I believe that that might have been later reduced in an appeal. So fair market value chain changes from day to day, from hour to hour sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would look at this a little differently. If the owners of private property who are pursuing this were just as willing to give back to the public the gains and fair market value they receive from government regulations and laws.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we take an action that improves and enhances the fair market value of property, there's no mechanism for us to recapture that. And nor should there be a mechanism for the taxpayers to be on the hook for a perceived decline in a fair market value.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We could take an action, and every action that we do take is subject than to litigation, because someone is going to claim that we diminished their fair market value if we imposed a height restriction or a view plane ordinance, suddenly we have taken away from all the property under that ceiling.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've taken away some of the density they could otherwise have built. We are subject to litigation for that. On the other hand, if we don't adopt tight restrictions and we allow people to build up as high as they wanted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then we'd be liable for litigation from people across the street who've lost their view of the Rocky Mountains and we've diminished their fair market value. This is just a horrible, horrible attempt to solve a perceived problem totally unrelated to most of what we do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I encourage everybody to take a good, hard look at this and ask yourself, do you really want your checkbook? After all, it's not our checkbook. It's yours. It's the public checkbook. Do you want that opened for blank checks to every property owner who says when you pass that law or regulation, you affected my fair market value'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Is that handled separately by the people requesting the approval from council to create the Metro District to, you know, put it on the ballot and whatnot? Or does a city play any role in any of that in any way, shape or form?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so the city plays a role in reviewing the the application that comes before us. And then we and then we also engage the city's financial advisor for that. But the initial kind of financial team for for the applicant, that's a completely private decision made up by the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So somebody from the team, can you give me an idea of the total square footage we're talking about for the proposed development at this location? Mr. Hurley. Maybe there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's approximately a million square feet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Yeah, because I mean, I was just looking at the one that came before us, and that was. I don't believe they were approved for 50 meals. Maybe I didn't hear that correctly. But this one is and clearly the amount of square footage on this one is a lot more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Almost 400,000 square foot more than the other one. So. Okay. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. At a finance committee. The slide deck showed these artists studios with some of them being some of the ones that are on the private property being mirrored in the public, in the parks. Right, in the parks area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there was some discussion about these being sort of publicly available artist studios to sort of and but there is no mention of that in the service plan. The service plan doesn't doesn't include the area outside of the property lines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is some language that manager finance can sort of add area. And so I just want to know, you know, you know, are the artists studios, in fact, part of this service plan in a way that I don't quite understand?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Espinosa That's a really easy question to answer. So as part of the 38 and Blake overlay, the value incentive that we are providing for the commercial height provides for community benefits agreement. So it's terrific about this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This will be the first community benefits agreement that we will be entering into and we will have as artist studios as part of that. So we've worked in conjunction with Parks and that's why it will be on the promenade, because Parks would like it to be located on the promenade.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so all of the requirements with respect to the artist spaces will be something that is part of a community benefits agreement with OED.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So how would that sort of legally be captured? And the service plan has defined boundaries in the exhibits, and these sites are not included in those limits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's part of the property owner. It's a developer's agreement that we're required to do because again, this is part of the 30th, an overlay, incentive overlay. So as part of our requirement to be able to get the additional height for the commercial property, we have to enter into this agreement directly with the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there will be some participation with the district once it's formed, but it will be entered into between the developer and the an EADS in order to be able to implement that 30th and Blake overlay incentive.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in theory, it's the developer is privately developing these improvements on city land and district money is not essentially being used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And originally, the artist spaces were going to be located on this property as part of the plaza that then would obviously feed into the promenade. And again, that was conversations with parks and kind of the spirit of what we've been working with the entire time, which is really cooperative nature.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the parks request was to have this as part of the promenade, to activate the promenade, which was an easy request.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Michael. On this one, the regional mill levy, it doesn't specify any projects that the city envisions levying this for or asking the district to levy it for. What do we have in mind for this? At this time, I'm not sure what we have in mind for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I imagine it would be some kind of cooperation with the the city, the Greenway Park or the Promenade Park. But, you know, I'm not sure exactly what. What what discussions have gone? I don't know. Somebody from the development team.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there a specific project that the last one that we did? The reason I was questioning that one was we had a specific project that were already that we had already funded. And we were asking the new metro district to provide a mil levy, a levy for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here we don't have a specific project for 25 years. We have this authority to ask the district to levy an additional five mills to provide revenue to the city for some undefined future need. Is that am I reading that correctly?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I think so. Did you give some comments? Yeah, it's. It's it's the ability to be able to enter into a future idea, to be able to. To levy those bills for a to to be determined. It's interesting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So we're creating with these metro districts, we're creating future financial capacity for city projects as yet undetermined. But but it is an IGA so the idea has to have terms with although the service plan says we don't need an IGA if we don't have one, we simply take the revenue from those five mills into the city'",
        "'speaker_1': 'rather than flowing them through the district. Okay. That's that's interesting mechanism. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn saying no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 944 is closed. Comments by members of Council Councilman Brooks. Yep.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And Councilman Flynn, I don't know if you're going here, but, you know, we just approved with the bond this entire the rhino promenade and this this this development actually is going to go in conjunction with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think what I like about some of the metro districts is as we can live, we if if we do decide to go into an idea. And so you don't need an HCA, but we can levy both.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can use both mechanisms to fund your development and to fund what we're trying to do some improvements on to our development. So that passed the bond pass overwhelmingly and this rental problem promenade was actually on the first tranche of dollars that would be spent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's one of the reasons I'll be supporting this. The other reason that I'll be supporting this is if you seen again, I always say, you know, you you need these mechanisms to fund infrastructure. And if you saw this area, if anyone's ever been to Blue Moon, this is the area of which Blue Moon is in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Mr. Hurley owns Blue Moon and the welcome in. He doesn't own that, but the welcome in that whole area over there, it is in desperate need of infrastructure and we need to activate that river. And so this entire project does that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Ms. Hurley does not have to activate the river, but it's part of his vision and it's part of the neighborhood's vision. And so we want to see that happen. But even even more of why I'm supporting those are the I think the criteria for me in funding a metro district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But one of the things that Mr. Hurley did not talk about is his support of formerly incarcerated individuals in the eight or two or five neighborhood. And I personally know of several that he has hired from the community in his company, Family, Environmental and you know, you know, his work with Impact Empowerment Group, led by Haroon Cowans'",
        "'speaker_7': ', has been great, but my hope is that we see more of that, right? We see more of that with this development. We see an incorporation of formerly incarcerated individuals who were gangbanging in this area and now part of the economic success.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I appreciate you hiring folks and I hope that we can grow its capacity. And I hope that many other business folks and developers in the city recognize their ability to connect folks with the economic success of the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'll be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Excuse me. I'm also supportive of this. My historical note for the evening is that, if I recall correctly, Denver's first Catholic Church was built down here, and I think it was flooded out and then moved up to where Sacred Heart is now in Larimer Street, the the issue of the regional levee and the'",

So it strikes me that this additional capacity to have a third party, a metro district, taxed its own property up to five mills is a bulwark against the city incur incurring cost overruns on the project or the infamous scope creep that we've seen in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a lot of projects. So to have to have that five mills authorized with no project in mind strikes me as a little prospective protection against city overrunning on the Promenade project. Nevertheless, I do support this project. I'm familiar with the area having worked on the the A-line project and and think it's going to be a great project'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We have three individuals signed up to speak this evening, so if you've signed up for this item, please come to the front bench. I'll call your name, step up to the podium and begin your remarks as time will start elapsing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First up, we have Isaiah Salazar.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, council members. I'm here on behalf of the ownership group Fox reinvestments here to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you say your name for the record?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Isaiah Salazar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next up, we have Jesse Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Jesse Paris. Black Star Action Movement. Self-defense. Denver Homicide. Lord, I had two questions. I wanted to know what was going to be the residential am I for this possible redevelopment? It's a very congested area. So what's going to happen with the parking over here?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. So somewhat to answer those questions, I would greatly appreciate it. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next up, Chairman Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. When he was chairman, Sekou found the organizer for the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Representing poor, working, poor homeless students and senior citizens. We support this zoning change. Because of what is right for this to happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In addition to the five criteria which. It obviously qualifies for. There is a piece in this that represents hope for the people that we represent. There's going to be a lot of job opportunities present and the possibility that instead of being historically ignored, we will be concerned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we know that part of the caveat for all of this is pretty much after these only requests are approved. Most of the time it falls by the wayside. And there's no follow up about whether or not these things are going to be made so that all the citizens can participate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We kind of leave that over to the developers and then you vote. I am, I am. I excuse me and know the aspects will seriously impact poor people. And as we continue on doing these things. In Michigan when I land.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you have development driving these areas who have been historically in the Gulf neglected. And yet there's nothing in place to ensure that the human rights of the citizens of the city county in Denver are going to be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adhered to and promoted. So the caveat becomes how do we continue doing what we're doing and then justify that in the name of established rules and regulations and laws? Well, we know laws aren't necessarily set up to protect the poor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The oppressed. The Exploited. Like slavery was like. But it wasn't necessarily a good thing for black people. So the struggle continues and we'll be monitoring the projects. We would like to hope and also be present at the table so that when these things are happening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, but your time is up. Thank you very much. That concludes our speakers. Are there questions for members of council? Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like to ask the question about. Whether or not the owner of this property is being asked to participate in the next step study for this area. Mr. SALAZAR Can you come forward and the next step study was being done?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was, I think, partially financed by the Denver Post site, looking at that intersection of 38th Avenue, Fox 25 and Park Avenue. And Fox really is the only road into this site. And I have discouraged our folks from the planning department from trying to look at the road that goes over 44th Avenue into the Globeville neighborhood from'",
        "'speaker_8': 'being considered as one of the access points. Those neighborhoods are being inundated with traffic. And so they have asked the Denver Post Project to do this study that looks at the infrastructure improvements that are needed. And I believe that includes drainage because as you know, that 38th Avenue underpass floods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So have you all been asked to participate in that next step study in helping finance any of the costs of that? Or have you been alerted that whatever the improvements are going to be required, that somehow you all may be asked to participate in that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, we were involved in the presentation that CPD put on, I think at the end of the summer, informing us all the property owners, kind of what the next steps are happening and the next step studies and we'll be a part of that as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And can you talk a little bit about what it is you're looking at doing with the site other than rezoning it?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Currently, we have no immediate plans whatsoever to do any development on the site. We are kind of waiting around to see wait for the light rail station, open up, really wait for the neighborhood to develop a little bit more to kind of see what comes of the neighborhood and what our needs of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Myself, my family, we we own quite a bit of property in the neighborhood where the owners and developers of the Regency Student Housing and we've been very excited for the light rail station and been teased with that for many years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as of now, we're really happy with the operation of the student housing and the car share program that we have kind of working on there with our shuttle service that we provide for the students and more. Want to see what kind of comes out of some of the other big properties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Denver Post site, uh, another site where the power rental site was as well to kind of see what is needed with the neighborhood, what residents. Kind of see a need for before we kind of pull the gun and start developing anything right now, especially on that site.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But you're looking at a mixed use development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we see a version, a mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And would you all potentially be the developers or would you sell it to a developer to build?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, our ownership group looks to develop it. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. See no other questions. The public hearing for Collinsville 8 to 0 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Looking at the criteria, this completely meets it. I'm glad that some of our family is involved with the conversations. Love to get your input on the. You know, some of the parking solutions that we're looking for. I mean, I know that's a quite an investment, but we're really concerned about mobility in this area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I would invite you to continue meeting with the community, meeting with CPD and meeting with our office as we start to look at mobility options for this area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. See no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Espinosa. Flynn, I Gilmore. I heard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Did I?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Carnage. Lopez. All right. Ortega. I assessment black eye. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am secretary. Please, because voting announced the results.'",
        "'speaker_4': '11 Eyes.'"

    "Zoning Change for 52 Monroe Street in Cherry Creek.": [
        "'speaker_0': '11 Eyes Council Bill 8 to 0 has passed. Councilman Flynn, will you put Council Bill 866 on the floor, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Mr. President. I move that council bill 866 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Constable 866 is open. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Gian Lorenzo got community planning and development. Before tonight, we have an official map amendment application number two 1809 Rezoning 52 Monroe Street from PWD 4083 to 0 three. 52 Monroe Street is located in Council District ten in the Cherry Creek neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The location is on Monroe Street between Ellsworth and First Avenue. The site is approximately 6250 square feet and currently contains a two story mixed use building. Again, the proposal is to rezone the parcel from the existing former Chapter 59 PUD zoning to growth three to allow redevelopment of the parcel with a boutique medical office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the proposed zone District G of three stands for General Urban Context Residential Office with a three storey height limit that allows urban house, duplex, townhouse and apartment building forms. So the existing context, as I mentioned, the existing parcel is former Chapter 59 zoning 5483.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is adjacent to GM x three to the north, g RH three to the south, additional PD zoning across the street and B one with waivers. Pudi, 43, was established in 1999. It allows a two storey building with a 6000 square foot maximum size and specifies the uses as a townhouse unit and attached office space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Like many PDAs from that era, it is written two specifically to accommodate a change in the size or location of the existing building or redevelopment of the site without zoning rezoning. Sorry. In terms of the existing context regarding land use subject site, as I mentioned, is currently mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is a single residence and office space. The block on which is located is largely nonresidential. There's a drive through bank to the north and there is one single unit residence of the south. Further to the south is an Excel substation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's a large bank and office building across Monroe Street to the west and multi-unit residential to the south west. So a little look at the existing building form and scale in the area. The subject site is highlighted in yellow there and that's looking at the existing building from Monroe Street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To the south is the Excel substation, which you can see from in street there. The existing drive through bank to the north of the site. And these are the existing banks, a large office and multi-unit residential in the southwest corner, looking on the other side of the street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So a bit about the process. This application went to Planning Board on July 18th, 2018, and they voted unanimously to recommend approval. It went to the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on August 7th City Council tonight, September 17th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In terms of public comment, there is one letter of support from the Cherry Creek East Association included with the application, and no additional comments have been received since that time. So to jump into the review criteria, criteria number one requires consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In this case, there are three applicable plans Comp Plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and the Cherry Creek Area Plan adopted in 2012. Staff found that the proposal is consistent with a number of comprehensive plan policies. These five specifically, which largely relate to promoting infill development and creating neighborhood nodes, and perhaps most importantly, land use strategy to see review'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and update city processes for enforcement of zoning and other land use regulations. These should include a consistent, enforceable set of performance standards for the owners and operators of all land uses and a swift, efficient and fair inspection and compliance process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that policy largely speaks to supporting rezoning from former Chapter 59 zoned districts. In terms of blueprint. Denver The site has a land use designation of urban residential. This anticipates neighborhoods that are higher density and primarily residential, but may include a noteworthy number of complimentary commercial uses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The make up of this block, as I mentioned before, is primarily nonresidential and largely represents a transition from the primarily urban residential area to the east and south to urban or sorry to the town and regional center designations along first to the north and west.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's also an area of stability, although as you can see here, it's immediately adjacent to an area of change. The goal for areas of stability is to maintain the character of an area while accommodating some new development and redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed zoning would maintain the existing mixed use character of the block while remaining compatible with nearby residential areas. The future street classifications for the streets adjacent to the site. Monroe is an UN designated local blueprint. Denver says that local streets are influenced less by traffic volumes and tailored more to providing local access.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mobility is typically incidental and involves relatively short trips at lower speeds. The proposed rezoning to grow three is consistent with the UN designated local street classification, because the zoned district enables low intensity and low scale office and residential uses along streets designated for residential purposes and traffic levels.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for the Cherry Creek East I'm sorry, the Cherry Creek Area Plan. The plan recognizes the value of boutique medical offices specifically and states that continuing to provide high quality office space for these boutique firms is essential to the mixed use character of Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Cherry Creek East Sub area in which the site is located, supports a mix of residential and office uses and some of the highest residential and employment densities in all of Cherry Creek, as well as the greatest diversity of housing types.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The plan also recommends reinforcing the residential character, respecting existing scale of the area and rezoning PDS to 2010 ten zoning code. So as you can see here, the land use designation largely fits the blueprint Denver land use designation of urban residential.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there is an anticipated building height here of three stories, which is also consistent with the proposed zoning. So for the first three criteria, staff does find that the rezoning is consistent with the comprehensive plan blueprint Denver and Cherry Creek Area plan in terms of the uniformity of district regulations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The request is consistent with this criterion as well. It's also rezoning from former Chapter 59. And so that brings greater uniformity into the regulation of the site. And it also furthers the public health, safety and welfare by implementing the city's adopted plans, as well as by bringing it into modern zoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So four criteria number for justifying circumstances. There is a specific sub criterion there that you can use. It says that the city adopted the Denver zoning code and the property retained former Chapter 59 zoning. So that is the case with this parcel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed rezoning would bring the property into compliance with 2010 Denver zoning code standards and would allow for redevelopment of the property in a manner consistent with the city's adopted plans and policies. And finally, criteria number five, which requires consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The general urban neighborhood context is characterized by multi-unit residential uses in a variety of building forms. And low scale commercial areas are embedded within residential areas. Commercial uses occur in a variety of building forms that may contain a mixture of uses within the same structure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'CAGR of three largely meets this neighborhood context description and the residential office districts are intended to provide opportunities for residential and office uses in low to moderate scale residential building forms. So staff has found that the proposed zoning is consistent with both the neighborhood context as well as the zone district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Therefore, Community Planning and Development recommends approval of 2018 by number nine based on finding all review criteria have been met.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We do have four individuals signed up to speak this evening. A few signed up to speak on this item. Might ask that you please come up to the front bench and be ready when I call your name to step up to the podium and your time will start to elapse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do apologize if I get your name wrong. First up, it looks like we have Tom Reagan ready.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mr. Chairman. Mr. President, members of council. I'm Tom Ragged Eddie. My address is 950 17th Street, Denver, and I'm here to speak on behalf of the applicant, Dr. Donny Elliston Mateo. The doctor has long had a medical practice in Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'East, most recently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At a 155 South Madison Street, and she has wanted to relocate and expand the practice.'",
        "'speaker_1': '52 MONROE.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The subject property here was on the market and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Was ideal, both in terms of its location and the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Structure that's on the property. It was also surrounded as as your staff told you, primarily by commercial uses in one residential rental unit, which is now owned by a colleague of Dr. Don Mateos. The problem was it zoning, it was owned under the old.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Code was approved and the old PUD.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Specified that two thirds of the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Residential and one third commercial. With respect to the rezoning, our original thinking was to amend the PUD, but after meeting with your staff they suggested grow three because even though it's a general district with primarily a residential focus, it does allow for certain kinds of commercial uses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That fit well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With the residents, including a medical practice. We met with Cherry Creek East Neighborhood Association on several occasions and Councilman Nu and Cherry Creek East gave us a letter of support when we agreed to enter into a good neighbor agreement, which waived a number of problematic uses that they didn't really want to see there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we would ask for your support as well, and we'd be happy to answer any questions. And Dr. Samatar, who is here, if you'd like to know anything about her practice. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And next up is Danielle Stamets, I.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It's. Hmm. German so-called black star movement self-defense. 2019 candidate for mayor Sue County in Denver. We support this wholeheartedly and. You know, this is one of the moments in city council where we get to see the little guy, not a little guy, but regular folks who are leading productive lives that seem to say an area and just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'need a break. You know. So. This is one of the times that, you know, we can step forward and say, hey, on behalf of the people, you know, leveling the playing field because it is consistent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why not? Why not?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And congratulations. Because I know that you guys are going to approve this 13 step. Not to jinx the boat, but in hopes that there's a unanimous vote and universal support for this ordinance change. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council? All right. Seeing no questions that the public hearing for Constable 866 is closed. Are there any comments by members of council? Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to give Jessie.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'An answer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is me shooting off the cuff and ball parking. On the prior rezoning that area. Typically the market rate, Amy, is roughly 122 to 1 30%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of the area median income.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In Cherry Creek. We don't measure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Very significantly north basically where our tables go, you know, and just that is what market rate is. Yeah, that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. No other comments. I will add that based on what was brought forward in the public hearing and in the staff report, I think it's clear that all the criteria have been met and I will be voting yes on this tonight.'",
