This the two engineering contracts on call are just over a year old, and if we're already increasing them by double, that raises a question where they should have been should have been that amount in the first place and come to us.'",

We're operating a shelter on Pecos that serves somewhere around 100, 220, 130 women a night. That building is going to cease to be available to us as a shelter.'",

I walk Sloan's Lake every morning and there's an elderly woman who literally sleeps under the bridge and gets up and has her own cart and has been there for a number of'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And my hope is that these are some of the very people, because when they end up in our emergency room or in our detox facility, it actually costs us a lot more than it is to house them.

Since we opened December of 14, 2014, since the very day that we opened the first Holy Rosary Women's Shelter at Samaritan House.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have not had an empty bed, and many nights we wind up moving chairs and tables out of conference rooms so that we can facilitate these women. I'm happy to say, unfortunately, that we've never turned a woman away.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'The Smith Road facility, you know, is a bust in facility. There's no walk up. So these women will gather at Samaritan House where we provide a hot meal in the evening. Then the women that can fit into the Samaritan House shelter at on Lawrence, of course, will stay there and the rest are then bussed out to the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'facility on Smith Road. But no walkup traffic is allowed out there from an outreach standpoint. You know, we do there is a street traffic network that these women know about. And as soon as we open up new beds, they're immediately filled.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the other thing, Councilman Ortega, it's important to point out is that we have an extended stay program that once they are sober and are able to, you know, recognize their plight and reach out for help to get out of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have a four month program that we move these women through very successfully. Once they get past that first 30 day period, we're seeing a success rate in the high 80th percentile who live with stable income. Unfortunately, housing is a bit more of a struggle because of the increase in housing in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm also happy to tell you that Denver Catholic Charities has 27 apartment buildings that we manage, and now we're working with HUD to develop a housing first initiative for the homeless that will allow them to get first in our waiting list for our newest property, which is over on South Federal and Councilman Flynn's district.'",

And we're setting aside 40 units for women and homeless people in general who are exiting homelessness will then be able to move up on that waiting list. The actual outreach, though, is done through a network of street communication and then also with Denver Road Home, where they send people out to to find these'",

And we find that the rezoning is consistent with comprehensive plan 2000 as seen here and articulated in your staff report. Moving on to Blueprint Denver, the city's land use and transportation plan, you can see that our subject site is called out as a mixed use concept land use as'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So, again, an area very familiar to you now. We can see that our subject site is called out in the ballpark, small area with urban design recommendations as seen here. So sighting buildings for a consistent street edge with parking in the rear, linking buildings to the streets through grounds to reactive uses, transparency and entrance requirements, all recommendations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that are not currently implemented by the general and industrial building forms in the I am x three zone district. You can see their subject site is also called out with a mixed use industrial land use category, that kind of mustard yellow color.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So recognizing that a mix of light industrial uses are appropriate to be mixed with more urban residential uses, where pedestrian access, of course, is still important. Now in terms of building heights, we can see that our subject site is called out in the pink category, which is a five storey recommended maximum building height, and again, a building'",
        "'speaker_4': 'height that has been reconfirmed through the recently adopted 38th and Blake Station area plan amendments. So a very consistent process moving forward. Based upon our review of the five criteria, we do find that the rezoning is consistent with adopted plans.'",

Consistency with neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent. Under criteria, the plans that apply to this property are Denver.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000, the Lowry Reuse Plan Blueprint, Denver and the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. The consistency with current plan is detailed in your staff report. I'm on the blueprint. Denver's slide land use concept was employment because at the time Blueprint Denver was adopted, the Air Force was still occupying the property and we thought they would'",
        "'speaker_11': 'stay. So there is it's it was designated an area of employment, but also an area of change, because we thought maybe someday there would be some change and the Air Force might not stay on to street. Classification Board Avenue is an undesignated local.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Monica Street Parkway is a residential arterial where we want to emphasize mobility over access. First Avenue to the north is a collector. Monica Parkway is also an enhanced transit corridor where we want to encourage transit, supportive land uses and practices like shared parking and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the Lowry reuse plan adopted in 93 and then re adopted with current plan in 2000, again, we didn't anticipate that the Air Force would leave. And so there is very little guidance in those plans to the current circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the Buckley Annex General Development Plan, this is in the neighborhood center west sub area. And this is a sub area that is intended to to respect the Monaco Parkway with a 35 foot setback, preserves some of the existing stormwater basins along Monica.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A nonresidential would be located on Lowry Boulevard, facing Lowry Boulevard and not facing the parkway. And there would be no secondary signage on park. Monica. The land uses were determined to be mixed use residential retail office or civic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Maximum height of five stories, although three stories were recommended along Monica Parkway and then building signs. Setbacks on Monica Parkway from the Crest Moore neighborhood were also included in the GDP and build to lines again would be from Lowry Boulevard, not for Monica.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the neighborhood context. So with that, Steph believes that the criteria for adoption for the adopted consistency with adopted plans is met. I am now on to review criteria for with this, which is consistency with neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Again, the neighborhood context is general urban characterized by multi-unit residential in a variety of building forms. Low scale commercial embedded in residential areas. Residential uses primarily located on local or arterial streets. Commercial located along mixed use and arterial or main streets generally in a grid pattern with detached sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Buildings typically oriented to shallow, shallow setbacks on the primary street. And balancing pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle use. So staff believes this zone district complies with that. And the zone we already did. So the specific intent of the DMX three zone district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a mixed use zone district with a maximum height of three stories. Acting as an active, pedestrian, skilled area embedded within neighborhoods now believes that criteria is met. So again, do believe that the this proposal conforms with the adopted plans, that it furthers the uniformity of district regulations, and that by implementing our plans furthers the public health'",
        "'speaker_11': ', safety and welfare. Justifying circumstances is changed conditions. The land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to a degree that it's in the public interest to to further redevelop or recognize the changed character of the area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With the redevelopment of the Hall Berkeley Annex, this is a changed condition with the closure of the Air Force facilities. So staff believes this the changed conditions is the appropriate justifying circumstance and we didn't really talk about the context.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So with all of that, staff recommends approval that believes all of the criteria have been met.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Lucero. We have two speakers this evening. The first one has already jumped up. Mr. Marcus Faulkner. And you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. Good evening. Council President. Council members. My name is Marcus Partner 7290 East First Avenue, Denver. I'm a consultant to the Library Redevelopment Authority. I'm actually only our only speaker tonight. Dave Andrews from LRA and John Putnam of our legal team are here for questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tricia did such a thorough job on this. I just want to highlight a few things, particularly maybe a little snapshot on this Monaco parcel. I want to get at why we arrived or how we arrived at GMAC's three.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Interesting to note in all of our presentations and actually in the GDP, this has been shown as a C-Max five zone district, a more intense five story development. So this is effectively a down zoning from a planning component of a five story to a three story.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The reason we ended up here is actually part of a community collaborative process, particularly with Chris, more neighbors across the street. We work with the Cress Moore Park second filing, looked in the park, stood in the park, actually hung balloons to show the height of a five storey building and how it might impact the park and their'",
        "'speaker_5': 'views across Monaca and really worked with them to understand the impact on that. We also made a commitment to the community, all of the neighborhoods surrounding this site, that we would not exceed 800 residential units on Boulevard one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We agreed to do an RFP to the development community first and actually come back with this final rezoning that actually is tailored to the market and the planning principles. To our great surprise and great benefit, we went to the market and we found what we believe will be hopefully a for sale condo development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Three story on this site. We think it is a terrific compromise for the community, a great project and a great culmination to the Boulevard one. So we. Believe, for all the reasons Teresa covered today, that we certainly have consistency with adopted plans and that this three story gimmick is the right solution for this site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I could share many more about the 60 plus community meetings that we've had. But certainly, as you can see, the lack of fanfare means that this has been a community collaborative process. The last thing I'd like to just mentioned in passing, Teresa noted that this is the last rezoning of Boulevard One.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is actually the last rezoning of the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. This is our 61st and final rezoning application to effectuate the building of 1800 acres. We did our first rezoning in 1995 with Councilwoman Flowback, and I think now we have 10,000 residents, 5000 residential units, and 35,000 people work, live or play on a daily basis in Lowry'",
        "'speaker_5': '. It is certainly pretty remarkable. And we want to thank all of you for your leadership and support on this, probably to note, because of what we've been focusing on, maybe our lasting legacy is there are 1082 permanent affordable housing units at Lowry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with all of that, we'd certainly appreciate your support on this zoning tonight. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you. Mr. Faulkner and John Putnam. Good evening, Mr. President and council members. My name is John Putnam.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am an attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the Library Redevelopment Authority. I'm here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my address is 1675 Broadway. Thank you. Thank you. All right. That ends our speakers questions for members of council. All right. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just noticed that you brought a schematic and wanted to know if you would share that with us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will be happy to. Councilman Ortega, this is the site Boulevard one. Obviously, we are talking about this parcel today, the Monaco parcel, both sides of Lowry Boulevard. This is the rest of the 70 acres of Boulevard one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This second schematic, which was really just an interesting note, these are the 61 rezonings, the different zoning clarify classifications on the entire site, including now the eight different zone districts in Boulevard one.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You bet. And we held them behind the camera.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we I think we may have got you on that camera there. Okay, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Theresa, I just have a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Couple of clarification questions. My OCD brain kind of rebelled at the address on this. 99 Monaco. 99 Monaco would be on the west side of this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But how did it get that address?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because in the assessor record, it's an entirely different address. I just wanna make sure we're not making a mistake.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Raise this at committee. It was given to the applicant. Write it in with that. I have to confess that stuff. I was paying more attention to the legal description to make sure that was correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's what Matt and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I was to the address. It should have been something like 98. Yes, approximately, given the side of the street that it's on. So that was a staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I may have to vote no because of that. I'm struggling. The other the other issue was you mentioned that that you received one letter of in opposition and but I couldn't find it in my email today. Can you tell us who that was from Margaret?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was a Weissmann. I don't remember her first name.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was from Michelle Weissman, I believe actually a resident of Boulevard One. Her question was to be sure that there were proper setbacks in this rezoning to actually protect the mountain views looking to the West. Of course, we are complying with the underlying setbacks, but it was a request of the LRA to have more ample setback.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An additional setback than what we're providing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Here. Well, she suggested 10 to 15 feet. I apologize. I don't know the setback in this zone district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. At that time, Theresa, unless you have more that that would be all I had.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I was just going to say that the setback along Monaco, per the GDP, is 35 feet, but there is an additional 45 feet. From.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. 45 feet along Monaco, in addition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Actually, Dave is reminding me that it is when you combine everything. It's one.'",
        "'speaker_6': '100. I read that in the staff report. 100 watts is set back on the east side then that that the opponent was was talking about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If you'll give me a moment to get my zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I'm going to let Councilwoman Susman chime in here. She wanted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I was just going to talk to Kevin. And Councilwoman Black had also raised this in committee about the 99 Monaco Parkway. And in fact, it's probably going to have an address on Lowry Boulevard, which isn't there yet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it was probably a, you know, conundrum, conundrum for the applicant about what the address is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I should just grin and bear it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Sure. I would actually like to add some give you a little level of comfort. It actually says approximately 99, Monaco, which is this this is approximately 99. And it's a marketing move. Right. You think you're moving into the park?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was that your come.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Specific set back?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So for dynamics three, I'm assuming that well, for the primary street, which will be Lowry Boulevard, there is no set back. Right. Actually, for the site interior on either side. There is no set back. Unless they're adjacent to a protected district, which would be ten feet.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's okay. And the letter of opposition requested. How much of a setback?'",
        "'speaker_11': '15.'",
        "'speaker_6': '15 from. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, did you say your coming or. You know, yes, the answer was sort of there. But I you wanted my question was simply was what? I assume Monaco has a parkway set back. What is that actual number?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I believe it's 20 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': '20 feet. So and then they're obligated to go the full 100.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, they've obligated themselves to. Okay, great. 100.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, thank you. Okay. All right. Any other questions for members of council? The public hearing for Council Bill 597 is now closed. Comments by members of Council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilwoman Sussman Thank you very much, Mr. President. It's a it's quite an evening when Marcus said that this would be the last zoning. One would hope, but never can tell. There might be some more zoning, but it is though it is the last zoning of the new areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly there might be some rezonings and it gives me a little bit of reflection because I started working on Lowry in 1992 as a one of those pesky neighborhood advocates worried about what it meant because the Air Force base was closing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And as I have spent many, many years with the Lori Authority working on this and am so proud of what the city has accomplished, what Laurie Authority has accomplished, what the neighborhood's neighbors have accomplished, because Lori is, if not the most successful, one of the most successful infill developments of a closing military base in the United States'",
        "'speaker_7': ', and is an example of how you redo a military base only when you have lots of participation, but regional participation and not only neighborhood participation, which has happened a great deal here. So it's a it's a sweet moment to think that it's the last zoning and it is the last zoning of the new areas and very happy'",
        "'speaker_7': 'with what the Planning Office has done. And the olive trees has been there on this since 1992 as well, though we're both only about 35, so that the math doesn't work all that much, but all the work that everybody has done on this and and it's it's an interesting we need to go out and celebrate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And I urge my fellow council persons to approve.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, because as soon as I have you in here. Is this from Prior? Yeah, I do think that's okay. Great. Any other comments from members of Council? Madam Secretary, actually, I'd just like to say congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think in the five years that I've been a part of this, we have had several of these rezonings go through and we've heard a lot of the story. And so thanks for your diligent work. Congratulations. I'll be voting in support of this Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Secretary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I. Black. Hi, Mark. All right. Espinosa, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Flynn, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Gillmor, I. Herndon. I can. I can eat. Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ortega. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I please close voting. Announce the results.'"
