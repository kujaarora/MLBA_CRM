And the response from the DOD was that it was simply for the construction and not, you know, sort of trying to turn its back on the fact that there is extended pollution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they were very clear that there's a five year construction period. So I do think it would be selling this community short if we're putting in mitigations that actually don't extend at least for the construction duration and let alone the long term health effects that are associated with being next to the highway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would really expect the city to sort of follow through and make sure that these commitments are at least through the construction period, since that is what CDOT is saying there for things.'",

In order to undertake these efforts, we are seeking to establish a tax increment area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The initial property and sales tax increment area would cover all portions of the urban redevelopment area, except for the property owned by RTD.

        "'speaker_7': 'It's my least reliable method. So if we just double, you know, the Broadway station partners, it's about 83 vehicle to 83,000 vehicle trips per day into this area. 83,000 just to compare is the same amount of traffic as three lanes of I-25 in a 24 hour period.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'He's heading this thing up to bring it up. And we've got to help. God help him. Seriously. All right. So anything that you ask for us to do, Wayne, for you, including maybe giving, you know.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We do what we see on Broadway. Yeah. You know, it's a big street. So I'm. I'm I'm not trying to minimize role model. I'm going get it. And I'm going to do everybody a favor tonight, too, because it's getting late and close this thing out because some time has been yielded.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you, Mr. Sekou. All right. This concludes our speakers this evening. Questions by members of Council. Oh, here we go. Okay. Councilman Espinosa started off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a couple of questions for Tracy. If I understand the slide, right. The total sort of economic benefit of this would be in the $60 million plus range. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Is it possible to pull the lights back up? Because I can go to that one of the groups if we want, maybe. That is the. How about that slide? So the infrastructure hard cost is about $63 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the slide slide 16 has a breakdown of the redevelopment plan. I mean, well, that's the height and the breakdown of the sort of development phasing in parcels. Yes. Is that part of what you consider when you're analyzing the mean this this plan area?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The development phasing itself or the related infrastructure could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Potentially.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Go together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So, I mean, that's the infrastructure for this buildout, essentially, right?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is correct. Which is consistent with what was put forward in the infrastructure master plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So then I have a one question on the on the project team on this slide as well. And I have my calculator, but what is the total number of square footage? The total square footage of the of the potential build out here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Lisa, do you want to address that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why don't you repeat that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Asari I could add up that bottom line, but do you have that total square footage?'",
        "'speaker_12': '6.5 million square feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': '6.5. Okay. So I'm missing some zeros here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, all product types.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Do you have. So all this new development would be subject to the new linkage fee. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. No, it's not. But.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is not subject to the linkage fee as it was put into the the review process prior to the application of the new impact fee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So is there a separate affordable housing planned for the site? And can you explain that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is a separate affordable housing plan. I am not the right person to describe that. And instead, I'd like to ask Jeff Romaine from the city's Office of Economic Development to address that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jeff Romer in the Office of Economic Development Council. President Burks Members of Council. Councilman Espinosa Yes, there is a separate, affordable housing plan that's been approved and adopted back in December of 2016. It calls for 330 units based upon the 2600 proposed units that are right now in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they'll they'll be responsible for delivering all those units without subsidy or they'll still be there. They are responsible for delivering those units under the guidance of the agreement. There is some characteristics of that agreement that talks about how we've incentivized those units to come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we worked out the agreement with Broadway station partners. The focus that that was trying to achieve was both long term affordability. So we achieved a 40 year affordability period. We are trying to encourage obviously tiered residential development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that was called out. Additionally, we were trying to increase the size of the units. So therefore, there is some incentive within the program in order to encourage two and three bedroom units as opposed to just studios in ones.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then finally, part of the plan is really trying to encourage a mix of affordability and so calls for vouchers to possibly put in place. So that would be some additional subsidy. Okay. And is there a requirement that that all happen within this dura boundary or can it happen off site like a lot of others?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is intended that it all occur within the boundary that it's talked about within the and I'm sorry about the color because I don't remember Tracy, but the one color was encouraged.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So right there to your left.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, just in the RTD side. The no, not the not the but the the Broadway station portion portion. And I think the RTD side was kind of an orange color. And the other was, I believe, a purplish color.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so then we could do well. Perfect. You probably already gave it to me. But if you could, there might be some value in me seeing that housing plan for for future reference. So if you could please just make sure I get a copy of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. Absolutely. Councilman, we have shared it with several of your colleagues already, and we're happy to share it with you also. Thank you. No further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Espinosa, it's a prelude to 38th and Blake. But yes, you should see it is really it to your credit, is innovative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilwoman Ortega Tracy, would you mind coming forward, please? The land that is to the west of Santa Fe going southbound. That's within the boundaries. Help me understand why that's included. I know that city is city park or is that land that is actually owned by gates.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And that's not swapping the park land for Vanderburgh Park that's on the site already? That is correct. Okay. And then Park that's on the site will be in part used as storm drainage.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Course, correct? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. You think?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If I may. Councilman Ortega, if you can see on the screen here. So this triangular parcel right here is actually a city owned park. And that's, again, on the east side of Santa Fe. This parcel down here is owned by BSP, by the developers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that is why this property is being included in the urban renewal area. It's going to provide the opportunity to cross the river as well as redevelop the park land. That is all that is owned by BSP. And to your other question, yes, this is the city park that a portion of it will be used for drainage'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And that's three acres. Is there any green space being added to it or is that the entirety of its size of the park?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is additional space that is being added to the park as a result. And I apologize. I don't have the slide that speaks to to that agreement, which is really part of the land conveyance agreement. But there will be additional land.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm going to if I can find my pointer here in approximately, approximately this area that will be added to the existing park space that will be developed. If you drove by there right now, you wouldn't know that it is park space.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But as part of the development plan, it will be developed as a park and then there will be an additional amount of land that is included to in part offset some of the use of the park land for the drainage facilities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the drainage will dump into the South Platte River. Correct. Yes, that is correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm hearing behind me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Okay, that's on my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. I take it let me just ask real quick, the drainage piece. Is that a part of this is GDP. IMPEY Okay. Is that a part of the Impey? Does that require.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we'll just I just I just have a quick question. What what's the. I'm curious on the drainage portion of it. What is the capacity?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Brad Dodson, Department of Finance. The capacity for the portion that's in the park is limited to I believe it's under an acre. I believe it's point eight, 6.83 acres.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's what we have as defined in our code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the infrastructure master plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Appreciate it. Oh, I'm sorry for for listening public. I said GDP, which is Jennifer General Jennifer general development plan. But AMP is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Infrastructure master plan. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just for the public that's listening to all these crazy acronyms. Councilman Flynn, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tracy on slide 18. Could you clarify for me the expected amount of TIFF assistance is approximately 90 million in parentheses in 20 $16. Does that mean that in year of expenditure dollars it will be more? And if so, how much?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Don't know how much more. It's all going to depend on inflation, other economic conditions that are in place at the time that the development is being undertaken in the infrastructure master plan, there is an allowance for inflation and I want to guess and say 3%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that that is right. But that is really in part why we have in large part way the infrastructure master plan is in place to already have identified according to the development plan that is anticipated what the expected infrastructure is, what the cost should be.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that was vetted very carefully by the city's public works department to then put some type of an inflation factor in place so that when the actual infrastructure is more clearly understood, there is a baseline from a cost standpoint to be laid up against what we believe the expected tax increment, maybe to make sure that there's a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'fit between the cost and what the amount of increment might be available to pay that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm. What? And if, you know, what are the years of expenditure? Do we know how out that can be?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It could be as far as, you know, 8 to 10 years. It really just depends on under then current market conditions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lisa, is that something you can speak to?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Exactly what Tracy was saying in market conditions will sort of tell us what that full buildout is. We're planning anywhere from 10 to 12 years at this of 12 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Okay. And one last question, Tracy. The RTD parcel. What is the it's not included right now in the TIFF. It's included in the redevelopment area, but not in the tiff for now. And why was there not the ability to reach any kind of an agreement to incorporate that at this time?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you for asking that question, because I in no way wanted anybody to feel that we did not have a cooperative partner because RTD worked very, very actively with the city, with BSP in trying to accommodate a development program in order to currently in order for us to bring it all together.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we there were just so many different influences that just really put us in a position where we were not able to reach those terms at this time. Remember that this is one of their busiest stations and it would really need to be a turnkey operation to make sure that their service was not disrupted at all.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so it was really just a matter of timing and a number of other issues that just really prevented us from coming to an agreement at this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Very complicated. And. And as you know, I've been concerned about maintaining the accessibility for patrons to use that by car. I have some constituents who drive there rather than take the bus over from from southwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's much more very convenient for them as it is. But in the event that RTD does at some point come into the TIFF district, how complicated will that addition be for us? You will have to come back to us to add it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got to restructure the whole tiff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Through.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Really all of the steps except for the the finding of blight. If we were to amend the plan, it would be as a material modification, a substantial modification to the plan. So we would have to understand what the development program is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Go back to Planning Board asked them to find that the amendment to the plan continues to be in conformance and go through the whole city council review process again. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we get a second bite at this apple. Yes. Thank you. That's all I'm proposing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm not sure who will be best to answer this, but I watched the Gates site for decades in my previous job as a journalist, and I met former councilman and current TOD Director Chris Levitt when he was, I think, director of the Front Range Economic Strategy Center and was fighting for local hires and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'living wage in the jobs that would be created on site. Is there anything in the agreements to date that addresses those issues?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thing is, as I look at Lisa, we're going to tag team this and maybe Brad as well. I can speak to that from Dora's perspective. In the companion ordinance that pertaining to the cooperation agreement between Durham and the city, there is the requirement by the city that Durham cause our programs to be applied against the project as'",
        "'speaker_11': 'they normally would. And one of those I mentioned Project R previously, one of those is our first source hiring program, which requires that any new jobs that are created as a result of the project are first made available to low income Denver residents.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that is true not only for the construction jobs, but any permanent jobs that would ultimately result on the site. So that is something that we, through the metropolitan district, will be looking to make sure that that is put in place, that it was an existing program even back when the Cherokee plan was in place.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that is going to continue. There were some other requirements that were in place under the Cherokee plan that that Durham is not responsible for. And I'll have Lisa or Brad speak to the status of those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The the versus hiring will be enforceable through the metropolitan district and all the infrastructure will be installed under the metropolitan district. So we will be subject to that provision as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any any guidance on wage?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And living wage. Yeah. You know, is what I understand is it's really not as applicable to the horizontal. That really comes into play with the vertical construction. So at this point in time, that is not part of our agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'May I also add, though, that both under duress policy, but more specifically under the Metropolitan District Service Plan, there is a requirement that all of the infrastructure be undertaken paying prevailing wage. So prevailing wage will be paid on all of the infrastructure that that the tax increment is supporting, as well as what the metropolitan district is supporting'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you, Councilman Cashman. All right. This concludes the question portion of this public hearing. Public hearing for Council Bill 1004 is now closed. Comments by members of council councilman, president pro-tem, Jillian Clark, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm really excited that we are finally here tonight. I've said this before and I say it again. This site has everything. It has a rail station and not just a rail station, but the second busiest transit center in all of Denver as Denver Union Station and then Broadway station.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It has Broadway, which is Denver's iconic Main Street. You have a connection, an on and off ramp directly to I-25. You have the South Platte River, Santa Fe, and a dedicated city park that since the 1950s, the citizens of Denver have never been able to access or use Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': '40 new people moving here on average a day. This is creating intense development pressure on our older neighborhoods, pushing housing prices through the roof and creating gridlock on our streets. This is the site where we can fit new people without tearing down historic homes or providing integrated, affordable housing unit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's no better place to show that transportation demand management tools can work to achieve the kind of mode shift that we have to be able to get to as a city than here. We also get two new bike ped bridges over the rail lines, a new vehicular bridge with an attached bike PED Bridge over the South'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Platte River, a dog park, a pedestrian focused market street, and so much more. This has been a really long process that started way before I was on council, but I'm so excited to be able to sit up here tonight and vote yes, yes to smart urban infill, yes to building a true transit oriented community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes to infrastructural infrastructure that will serve so more, so much more than just the people who will work, live, and play on this land, but will connect neighborhoods that have been separated by huge barriers for decades and provide real bike and pedestrian options that connect people on the West Side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Finally, to transit on the east side of those barriers and to Denver's Main Street on Broadway and the people on the Eastside connected to the South Platte River with $30 million of new parks and improved trails, and the Levitt Pavilion offering 30 free concerts a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with that, I would urge all my colleagues to please vote yes on this, and then let's go grab some shovels. And at long last, get this project started. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. It almost sound like you're pitching somebody. They're like Amazon or something like that, but I don't know what I'm talking about. Okay. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate a lot of the questions that my colleagues asked just to get some of what back in the day we called community benefits that are emerging from this project. On the record, I was with the former colleague that Councilman Cashman mentioned was very involved in this project from helping a coalition kind of'",
        "'speaker_12': 'achieve a vision for the site, and then to negotiate that vision with the former developers and frankly, with the city, you know, because the city wasn't as excited about affordable housing then as it is now. Hard to believe, but they kind of thought the market should take care of those things.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We've come a long way and in some ways the discussions we had about this site really created a whole bunch of things that are now much more institutionalized in the city. So the fact that prevailing wage applies and shrunk infrastructure and other projects never was a policy.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Prior to this. We weren't doing a great job with first source local hiring at the time that this project was being discussed. And so there have been fits and starts with how well we do on that local hiring program.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But but there are and now it's it's much more of a frequent expectation that affordable housing plans be adopted. And just to clarify just one tiny point, the fact this this project would not have been exempt from the linkage fee without an affordable housing plan because it didn't have actual development plans approved.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So the fact that it had a vision in the pipeline would not have exempted it from the linkage fee. What exempts it from the linkage fee is the fact that there's an adopted housing plan. And I think that that is it's you know, we always have this dance about whether or not we should take big projects or'",
        "'speaker_12': 'big sites in the city and just apply our standard policies, which sounds like a good idea when you want uniformity and predictability. But then you have sites that feel like they want to create customized solutions because they have unique opportunities or they have unique challenges.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We can never quite decide which is better customized or standard. And so we have a policy that allows for both. And I think that that's. A good thing. I appreciate especially the fact that the former housing plan for the site included some lower income units than the overall plan here is including in some ways.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But it also it had necessarily a shorter potentially a shorter period of affordability. So we've exchanged some of the deeper affordability for a longer period of affordability. The other thing that we're getting is the fact that one of the community's visions for this site was that units that were affordable would be spread throughout the project.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'At the time we negotiated the last deal that wasn't possible. We were relying on tax credits and they tend to have to happen all in a building. And so in some ways, it's fascinating that we're actually more achieving that vision today with this revision, which it's a new proposal, but it's a revision to a former former plan'",
        "'speaker_12': 'in some ways, from the community's perspective, that we actually are achieving more integrated and more mixed income throughout the site rather than just certain buildings. And lastly, I want to express my appreciation to the department and to Broadway station partners for the fact that some of these units will be for those who have Section eight vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We know that we have folks in the city who have vouchers, who can't find apartments. So so there's a number of things in this plan that although they look different and they feel different than that long ago process, they achieve some of the same outcomes or better outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so I appreciate the fact that that affordable housing plan was so carefully thought out and negotiated. And I appreciate the fact that we also did better this time on some of the connectivity and mobility. Right. And so there's a lot in this plan to like.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We know it's a tough market out there. So that is going to be the challenge that you face after this vote tonight. And I'm hopeful that we can be resilient this time around. And I know that that won't be easy.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But but that's my hope, is that we see this vision built. So thank you to everyone who is involved in for all the work you did, keeping my office and in particular involved in aware. Thank you.'",

And I also wanted to mention the gentleman that I met along the way named Steve Maskey, who was became a point person for Cherokee development and almost got this project to the point of taking off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were grand plans. I mean, Robert Redford's Sundance Cinema was interested. We had a big time developer out of Chicago ready to break ground, and then the 2009 rolled around and everything went down. So, yes, Steve Moore took me for a spectacular.'",

Cannot begin to imagine what it's going to look like. I'm very glad that they were able to incorporate at least some of the affordable housing, local hire stuff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, the connectivity. You did do a great process, kept us on a loop from day one, and I do appreciate that. It says a lot when you have the community with you and when you have a lot of folks saying, let's finally do something here, you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The other thing I have is kind of I mean, growing up just a stone's throw away. I got to me, it was great target practice. But I mean, with with baseballs and rocks and stuff, it was actually pretty cool.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So thank you. So we got that. I know you, though. I know you've been waiting to get that one out. Councilman Espinosa, we're out of a good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm glad my colleague digressed and I can keep going. No, no. One of the things I was get I was scribbling here was a bunch of numbers. And the numbers are, you know, me sort of figuring out how much taxes my block generates and it pays in property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I came up with just under $60,000 a year for the 59. Let's be simple structures. I mean, homes on my block and I did the math on paving. And if we paved both lanes and on the block, that would be $31,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So every year, my my block contributes. That's without sweet street sweeping fines and towing fees that are related to this the games. And so we're pumping money into this economy that's I mean into the revenues into the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's how this thing works. I understand that we're not always going to get what we put into it. And actually, I did that math wrong, that 58,000 is what we get from the city. I mean, that's that's what's left over, actually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We collect $146,000 a year from that block. Most of that's going to schools, which we didn't have very many kids on my block, actually none for about nine years. So we were that was net going to the schools.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, that's our part. My point being that earlier today council members discussed our budget request and this property in this station area has the benefit of having an applicant willing to go to a leadership in an organization willing to go through this entire process for the GDP and the IMP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And these are things that our all of our station areas would love to have. And in some cases, like 41st and Fox, my station area on sunny side, we don't have that sort of massive master developer. Councilwoman Black asked for money for her sophomore station.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a lot of stations that actually need this level of analysis, planning and put in, in and in thoughtfulness that may actually end up in a a request. But the city has to put resources in. So for decades, blocks like mine have existed by these other station areas, contributing and paying their dues and paying their fair'",
        "'speaker_2': 'share and getting minimal resources in exchange. These are areas without sidewalks, the areas with crumbling streets, because that paving cycle's 15 years. So that $31,000 that gets kicked back in paving every 15 years. And so I just want to use this the sort of feel good nature of what we're finally hopefully going to get this round with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this this level of deferred investment. You know, it's it's taxing yourselves to to sort of pump this back into the infrastructure to enable all this redevelopment to to then contribute to this economy the way we are. There are communities that are actually station areas that don't have that massive take down to one single developer, but they have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the same infrastructure needs, the same planning needs, the same zoning requirements, the same design guidelines, the same affordable requirements that need to be addressed. And so we can do that as a city, that we can do that as a council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we need a push for 41st and FOX GDP AMP and need a push for South More Station because we have the resources to do that in our budgets today. So I just wanted to remind my colleagues that it's it's decisions like this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's great when we have people coming forward that are doing this, but we have station areas that we put in infrastructure already. And if we don't, we get what RTD sort of initiates and that's not great. So thank you for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for sort of circumventing RTD and then pushing RTD to probably a better place in the end. So I'm looking forward to supporting this things. Okay.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's just been called Northside because that's what the treatment plant was called. So this is really the official naming of this park. It's very unique in that the community was involved in working with the artists in etching different messages onto the concrete, onto the sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if again, if you haven't been there, it's interesting to walk through and just read some of those messages that were created both by youth and adults from the global community. The changing demographics of the residents in the community are rapidly changing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And again, the community wanted to be involved in the naming of this park to show the legacy and the history and the contributions by the two names that will be placed on this park now. So the reasons to name this park, it carries forward a shared history of stewardship and protects the neighborhood's past and changing demographics that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'impact this area. So Carpio and Simonetti family were leaders in Globeville and Elyria. Swansea, a community in Denver. Their civic, commercial and cultural contribution contributions deserve preservation to inspire future leaders and are youth that live in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Community leaders should be recognized in the areas they helped build. The renaming recognizes the importance of Sel Carpio and the same Unity family in their community to the Denver Parks and Recreation System and to the city and county of Denver as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Naming the park Carpio Sanguinary is suitable, appropriate, symbolic and historic. So a little history on the Simonetti family. They were a Globeville family. They lived in the global community. And you'll hear from one of the descendants that still lives in the global community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They were a pioneering family that settled in North Denver in the 1850s. A portion of the park was part of the community farm located on the South Platte River. The family operated a North Denver grocery store that sold produce in the area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They also led a fight to stop upstream slaughterhouses from dumping waste into the South Platte River. As I said, the salmon descendants still live in Globeville in these pictures that you see were provided to us by historic Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now to move on to sell curfew. So Carpio was a member of this body. He was a Denver city councilman. He was a visionary leader. He also had roots in Globeville. And I didn't know when we started this process that when his family moved from the Greeley area to Denver as a small child, he lived in their'",
        "'speaker_6': 'family, lived in the Globeville neighborhood. He was a Denver public school teacher, a Metro State College professor of sociology. He served on the council from 1975 to 1987. And one of he was one of Denver's first Latino city council members, along with Sam Sanders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I believe we're going to hear from his son. Also a former councilman, Zell served as the council president. He authored the registered neighborhood notification ordinance in 1976 that empowered neighborhood organizations and gave them voice to what was happening in their neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He was also a catalyst for redevelopment of the Central Valley, which was at the time abandoned railroad land and is now home to DaVita Union Station, over 10,000 residents and much, much more. It's almost completely built out now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As a community leader. He also established numerous city parks. Commons park cornerback. A park confluence, which are all in the Central Valley, among others, was the North Side Park. As I said, he was the catalyst for moving the redevelopment of the old wastewater treatment plant park site into a park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He established nine community centers in his council district. He was also the executive director of the Denver Housing Authority from 1994 to 2007. He modernized several Denver housing developments, including Quick Newton Curtis Park in North Lincoln, and that involves securing the funding to make those developments happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He was an efficient steward of federal housing funds, not only at DHS, but when he served on the council. And way back then, the community development funds were actually earmarked by appointees of each councilperson. It was called the Community Advisory Committee that basically earmarked where those funds would go.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it was also nationally recognized for his leadership at DHS and many of his DHS initiatives adopted by federal funds and. Included projects like and this wasn't a DHB project, but the Urban Development Action Grant, which is where the King Soopers is on 13th and Spirit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many of you may not remember, but we used to have junkyards along the Speer Boulevard corridor where you see those high rise apartment buildings. Cell was the catalyst in securing that federal funding to turn that area into something more attractive to the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The next slide shows you just a sample of the signatures. I passed the book down the dais for you to see all of the signatures that were collected. This part required, I believe, 3300 signatures and 650 were submitted to Parks and Recreation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that was done intentionally because there was 20 acres purchased to the west of this site with wastewater funds during the same time that the city was doing the Justice Center project. And that's to look at including some additional storm drainage for the area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And because that master plan is still being done in that project is not entirely finished. We wanted to move forward with the acreage as it's currently defined, but anticipate that these 20 acres will eventually be added to the park and the boundaries can be expanded.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The 600 signatures is what's needed for a larger what's considered kind of a regional park. The next slide shows you the community and civic support. As you saw from the book that was passed out. We had letters of support from many of the leaders in the community, as well as residents from the neighborhood and the global community'",
        "'speaker_6': 'played a vital part. We had many meetings in the community with residents from the neighborhood, mostly some of the key leaders from the neighborhood, to solicit their support for this. And again, as I said, they were pretty adamant about moving this forward before all the development in the neighborhood happens.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to thank the global community for their efforts. Many residents helped circulate petitions. I want to thank Happy Haines, a former councilwoman that also served with Sal Carpio, for her efforts as the manager, Parks and Recreation for moving this forward and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee that voted to move this on to the manager in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'request of sending it forward to city council. And as I said, I mentioned my staff earlier. Susan called already and Joe Wood from my staff also assisted in this effort. And just the very last slide. You know, it's it's always an honor to ask city council to be able to recognize leaders of our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just want to respectfully ask for your support in naming this as the Carpio Simonetti Park after former city councilman Sal Carpio and the segment that his family who were pioneers in this neighborhood. So at that, I'll leave it at that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know we have some people here that are signed up to speak in support as well. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. We have 12 folks who are signed up to speak. I'm going to ask every name that I call. I'm going to call five names at a time. I'm going to ask you to come up to this front row here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just get out your seat and come to the front row. And everybody has 3 minutes, by the way, and no one is speaking in opposition. So this will be a good a good public hearing for city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So Marissa macias. Teresa Carpio. Karen Carpio. Thomas Florence Navarro, Mary Dirty.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But let's see. What do you do? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's five. So come on up here to the front and let's say you are first. You have 3 minutes. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name is Mauricio Macias. I'm a resident of North Denver. So Carpio was my grandfather. Right now, I'm currently a student at CU Denver studying human development and family relations. And one of my classes in the past semester actually read about my grandfather and his name was mentioned with his thoughts and opinions around social justice'",
        "'speaker_8': 'issues that were happening. And it brought me a lot of pride to read about him along with my classmates. I can't help but feel hurt as well, not being able to ask him personally and learn from him directly, just like his perspective and his opinions on everything.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I wish that when he was here I would have got more of his opinion and his thoughts on his personal on his professional life and his accomplishments. My life is so different without him. I remember he would always say to me, Hey, miss, if you need me, just call me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was his thing. He would always say, Just call me and I'll be there. As I mentioned, he didn't talk a lot about his professional life with us because he was the man that I knew was a humble man who was all about his family.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He was there to attend every soccer, basketball, football school play that his grandchildren had. Some of my favorite memories growing up was being at my grandpa's house. He always made it feel like it was our second home. He made us feel cared for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He made us feel safe. And he always made us laugh. For Christmas, his home was one of a kind with Elvis and Bronco decorations, something that we all miss dearly. He played a key role in teaching me the values that I still carry with me today, like family and education, hence my educational path that I chose.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My grandfather left a lasting impact on my life, and I hope to continue his legacy of being a strong and caring voice for others and making a positive impact on those around me. I hope you choose to continue his legacy in an area of Denver he devoted his work to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My grandpa was not a perfect man, but he overcame every single struggle he faced in his life. He was hard working with a heart of gold. During this time of our city growing and changing, it's crucial to keep our roots grounded.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For my generation and the generations to come, if my grandpa was still here, he would be so excited to welcome his first great grandchild. And we hope to teach him and show him the park one day when he's old enough to go play over there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank Councilwoman Debbie Ortega from the bottom of my heart. We could not have done this without you. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms.. Macias. Torres Carpio.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello. I'm Teresa Carpio. I live at 4730 Tennyson Street. Hello, Councilman? Yes. First of all, I would like to thank you all in particular, Councilman Brooks and Councilwoman Ortega and her staff for all their efforts on behalf of this proposal to rename the park to Carpio Singh Greenwich Park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm proud to be the sister of Sel Carpio. As you have heard, sell dedicated virtually his entire career to the service of his community. Whether that was as a teacher, his 12 years as District nine councilman. Or as director of Denver Housing Authority for 12 for 13 years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As Debbie mentioned earlier, the roots of my family are deep in Globeville. My grandfather, Nicholas Navarro, worked at a flour mill, then located at 32nd in Brighton. My mother was raised at a house across the street from that flour mill so that my grandfather could keep an eye on her and the kids.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the early 1940s, my family moved from Gill, Colorado, a farming community to Globeville, so that my dad could work at the flour mill with my grandfather. My brothers, Ed and Cel. Later attended Swann R Excuse me. Garden Place Elementary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sal loved Denver. He loved it a lot, which is evidenced by his diligent work to be a champion for those whom he serviced. He was a visionary, and his efforts both in city council and while leading Denver Housing Authority, helped make Denver the fine city we all consider to be today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a family, we are so proud of the man he was. He was funny, witty, loving, hardworking, and devoted to his family and friends. As former Mayor Federico Pena stated in his letter, Cel shaped today's Northside Park and it is appropriate and fitting that it now be named in His honor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Together with Celles family and mine. His daughters, his sons in law. And his dear friends and his grandchildren. We thank you for your consideration of this proposal. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms.. Carpio. Karen Carpio. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi. I'm Karen Carpio. Thomas. I'm a self-starter and. When you do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, basically, I want to thank everybody. And I'm just honored that my dad's being considered. It's an evening with the family. They were both active in the community. My dad loved his time on council. I really do think about it every day.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was younger at the time and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As a teenager I wasn't always aware of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All the importance of the things he was doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Ortega's support on this and all the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Help she's provided and her great respect for my father. I thank everybody for the letters they wrote, and he would truly love being named.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'After a park. He loved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To barbecue. He liked to play games. He played Wiffle ball all the time in the backyard volleyball games, family. The most important thing to him and I think it's very important to my nieces son and everyone who just knew him as dad or grandpa have something.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To show their children.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and where he could be honored for everything he did. They loved him for grandpa, and I loved him as my father. But I really just think it would be a great honor for us and the sanguinary family to have this happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Carr. Bill Thomas. Florence Navarro.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, everyone. Yes, Florence Navarro. I reside in North Denver. 2728 was 39th Avenue. And thank you very much for bringing this forward, Deb.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And just want to talk a little bit about the why. Why are we doing this? Why are we? Besides Wood Theresa has put out there, besides what Karen and Marissa eloquently stated, you know some of the why. I grew up around cell.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Kim and my father, Richard, were first cousins and spent a lot of time with each other. So for me, the why is about cell as a role model, not only for myself, but for several others. For many of your predecessors on council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Learned from cell. Cell was a first in many, many different areas, as was stated before, professor. And just in the community, that community leader, that role model. And so for me, it's about our youth need more role models.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who else could we call upon to be the role model any more special than cell and the what was put forward with the sanctuary family as well? So between both of them inspired us, our family, the community. I think about Sal and what he did for being that public servant.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Oh, my gosh. All of you know what?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's like 24 seven. So for me, it's what he contributed. The community leader thinking about, you know, his character, work ethic, taking great, great pride in everything that he did, the visionary that he all of Debbie spoke about, the visionary, the plans that he put forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And now to see all of that come come to fruition. So it's about also the personal side, his family, his friends. I remember one of his favorite activities, bowling. They talk about his, you know, excitement around the Broncos.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But bowling, let me tell you, very, very committed to bowling. But there was a place where he could interact with people, hear what's going on in the community, get to know what's, you know, others asking those ideas, finding out what was important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Relationships were important to sell. So again, those are just a few of the attributes that truly reflect the role models we need more of, especially in North Denver, especially in the global area. For our kids to look up to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As as the family has talked about what how how much pride we will take in sharing with the youth in that community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time is.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Up. Okay, thank you. I'll just.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Say thank you very much and how much pride we would have in naming it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Carpio Spaghetti Park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Mary did it, Matt. I don't know if we may have your last name spelt wrong. Please correct me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How? My name is Mary Sanguinetti. During my my family's lived in Coalville for over 150 years. I'm the fifth generation to live there. And I just ask you all to vote. Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Miss McDermott. Sanguinary. All right. I'm going to call the next five up right now. Thank you. Tim Sandals. John. Zambian gate Markkanen. Gate Markkanen. Debbie Gomez. Patricia. Patricia? Patricia Baker. And it looks like we don't have gates.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He had to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Leave.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we'll call up a chairman and say, who has the fifth? Mr. Sanders.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mr. President. Members of Council. My name is Tim Sandoz. I am the executive director of the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative and a former member at large of the Denver City Council. I wanted this opportunity to celebrate South life and support this park just a little bit more history.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sal came to the city council the same time my father did not. Technically, my dad's race wasn't as challenging as Sells was. So technically, my dad was the first Latino ever elected to the city council. But sale was a real close second.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We'll let that go. For those of you who may not know, my grandparents did start in Globeville. They're buried right now at the cemetery there. And my family had a long history in Globeville as well. My brother and I even happened to be the plant manager of Nabisco before it became Purina.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It smelled a whole lot better then. But along through those days, sell my dad. There were a group of council members who first came together and made some of the most significant changes to the Denver City Council at the time it was settled.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Carpio, Sam Sandoz. Bill Roberts. Calvin Caldwell. Hiawatha Davis. Kathy Reynolds. Debbie Cathy Donohue. Excuse me. So as I think about these folks and some of the changes that they made to the council, that was when the council first moved from seven members to 13.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now, the other thing that happened of each of them had a commitment to making sure that they trained and developed another cadre of leaders behind them. So with Sal Carpio came Debbie Ortega, Sam Santos came Tim Santos, Bill Roberts came Happy Haines with Alvin Caldwell came Hiawatha Davis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so many of us were trained by the leadership of this first cadre of people of color coming to the city council and working on behalf of their communities in ways that hadn't happened before. Now, back then, they did call them the Amigos, and that's because they did become such close friends in making sure that the people'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in their communities, people of color, were taken care of. I was blessed because of that. When my father died, it was Sal Carpio and Bill Roberts and Alvin Caldwell and Debbie and Ramona martinez, who brought me along and mentored me, and Sal Carpio, who helped me through public housing when I was actually working with HUD on a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'national basis and came back and got to work in Denver in developing some of the projects that Sal Carpio championed, both when he was on the city council and then the work that he did when he was the executive director of the Denver Housing Authority.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Boy, I see that my time is up already. I certainly talked too much. I think it is only fitting in just five more seconds, Councilman, that this Saturday we are going to be having a picnic in the park at what will now be called Carpio Sanguinary Park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It will happen from 10:00 to 1:00. And I think Papa and Cell are in heaven right now celebrating because ironically, we will be dedicating the Sam Sanders Mel Sam Sanders Park at the same time so they can watch us celebrate our parks together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I hope everybody who has a chance can go and celebrate at the park. The new naming. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Santos. All right, John Zappia on the. John Zappia.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is John Martinez up in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I live in Globeville. Mr. President, members of council, you're going to hear a lot about the sanguin that family and sell Cardinal's family. And I want to. Kind of expose you to some.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the other sides of this. I have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Here before you. And I'm going to ask.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You for an affirmative vote in the naming of that car bill, saying when that park. I'm pleased to be a part of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a mixture of of of pride and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Humility.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In this whole effort. All the efforts that's gone into this. It's been a very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very learning experience for me. I'm proud to have been associated with the people involved in this, with both families. And the whole process has been very humbling to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And believe me, that takes some doing. The effort. It's not just another name in. The combined effort that went into this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's an entry into the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pages of history in the Globeville neighborhood. And it's a homage. The both the family names Carpio and Sang Minetti. And not just them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But also. The ancestors involved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here, their ancestors and the ancestors of all the people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That they worked with and they lived with. And believe me. It has been humbling, but also an.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Encouraging. Your vote tonight will be the first step in the redevelopment of that park area. We're involved presently. What the Heron Pond project and we will pursue the improvement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ten, 15 years from now. It's going to be a beautiful, beautiful place. Hopefully sooner than that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mrs. Upjohn. Debbie Gomez.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, city council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My name is Debbie Gomez. I live at 4905 Clinton Street in the Sunset neighborhood. I'm here this evening representing the Sanguinary family, although I am not directly related to him. My first cousin is a descendant of the Sam Kennedy family.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, he's named after.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One of the very first people that moved into that area in 1860. His name is Louis Sanguinetti. And so I urge you to please move this forward and change the name of this park to Sanguinetti. I'm sorry, Carpio Sanguinetti Park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And on behalf of the family, because they've been there so long and the park actually is a part of the original farm. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Gomez. Patricia Baca.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Council. My name is Patricia Barker, and I reside at three, three, one Cook Street. I'm in Councilman News District, and I'm here to speak this evening on behalf of people of Denver who've lived here all their lives and who've lived in many parts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In fact, most parts of the city. When my parents. Lived here. We were renters. We rented in Globeville, we rented in Curtis Park. We rented in what is now the agrarian campus we rented in various parts of the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The last one was in Westwood. My experience with this city has been that access to resources and specifically speaking about recreational resources in parks is not available to all members of our city. I believe that our city's residents all deserve access to a park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And beyond that, the symbolism connected with the naming of this park. Capo sound good? Natty speaks to me very deeply because of the importance of both of those families to this area historically. And I would expect that Councilman Flynn will refer to this in the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The saying what any family being here in the 1800s and also historically. Sal Carpio being one of the first individuals that represented our Latino community on this city council, I had the opportunity to work with him as I was a part of Denver Public Schools when we put together the North Lincoln Project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we did that because he cared. And we did that because it took hard work. And we did it because he loved Denver. I think this represents Denver loving him back. So I urge you to vote for this, this evening, and I appreciate your taking a look at it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Baca. All right. I'm going to call the next five. The next two people. Actually, the next I don't see is Don Morris here. And you have to go. Okay. Last but not least, Chairman Seiko. 3 minutes this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. My name is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tim as a crew organizer for the Black Star Action Movement. It takes a giant. To introduce the giant. And when we talk about the transition going from. One generation to another in terms of city council and leadership in the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can definitely say that. So Carpio was a giant when I was growing up here in the Five Points. And he was no stranger. To black people. And we had a barbershop called Bishop's Barbershop. And Sal used to be up in there with Mr. Pierre from Supper Club and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There would be a dis engagement in terms of political conversation with the jukebox playing in the front with some Ray Charles rolling around having all day. And as as a kid, I would just sit there and be a part of that because my father cut hair there for 35 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I grew up sweeping the floors and whatnot in the barbershop, in the pool hall and just hanging out, you know, and running errands for Elvin Caldwell, folks. So. So was outstanding human being for real. And he had a wonderful sense of humor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he had this way with youngsters where he would bring us in and he would say, Look. You're going to have to do this. You go ahead to do that and you're going to have to do the other because this is what we do, period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's just it. And you keep it real simple. And then you could always count on Sal coming through it to make sure that he was doing what he said you were supposed to be doing. And there was awards for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, and also there was a gentle nudge in terms of keeping your pushin, you know. And so. Debbie, thank you for doing this because you picked up the ball and you've carried that legacy forward. And for folks who don't know, Debbie is revered in the black community as the godmother of city council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You want something done, you go see Debbie. Debbie going to get it done it what I'm saying. And she's going to do it unapologetically and then she's going to do it gently. And I'm kind of learning that to now, you know, how to be a gentle person and got there yet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I am working on it. But. You did it. You did it. And you've been doing it for a long time. Sal did it. He did it for a long time. And we've got 7 seconds left so that I'm going to do it and I'm going to get out of here on time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Chairman. Say coup for getting out of here on top. No judgment. Thank you, sir. Good words, everyone. Everyone was very eloquent. Thank you. We now have questions for members of council. Any questions for members of council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. This concludes the hearing on Council Bill 984. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman Ortega, you've made some comments, but I want to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I'd like to add just a few more that were not in the presentation. There were a couple of people that were planning to be here tonight that could not. One was Sandra Roberts, who heard her late deceased husband.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Bill Roberts and cell were bowling buddies. They used to go fishing together and. You know, as as you heard Chairman Sekou say, the fact that there was this coalition of them that would work together to try to get policy changed in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other one was Kathy Reynolds. And I just want to read a note that she shared with me, and I hope she won't mind me doing this. But her note says, Do you remember Teddy and my son Bob work together?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Teddy was Sal son. They work together at Carbone. One night, someone stole batteries from the patrons cars in the parking lot. He sent Bob her son, out with a wad of cash to buy replacement batteries. A 16 year old redhead kid.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in a 13 year old VW bug buying up all the batteries he could find in North Denver. Cell made it work. He always stepped up to the plate and tried to do the right thing. His civic accomplishments are awesome.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The legacy he left in goodwill is even more extraordinary. And she says, We'll miss you and celebrate, you old friend. So that's from Kathy Reynolds. So I had an incredible sense of humor. His granddaughter, Marissa, and my oldest granddaughter, Gaby, went to school together and they played sports together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And every time I would see him, especially when when you were first born, Marissa, he would say, My granddaughter can beat up your granddaughter. Little did we know they'd be playing basketball and other sports together. Sal was an incredible advocate for affordable housing and for homeownership, and he was the catalyst that got Del Norte Neighborhood Development started'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I worked with him in his office and he urged me to serve on that board, and I still serve on that board to this day. His efforts transformed and changed many of our neighborhoods. You heard me talk about the Urban Development Action Grant along the Sphere Boulevard corridor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Had that project not happened. Who knows how long it would have taken to get rid of the junkyards along Speer Boulevard? I learned so much from SEL about what it means to be a servant leader, and he truly epitomized what what that means.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He was an incredible leader that just went above and beyond to work with community, to help organize them, to help them learn how to do for themselves. And this started out as a project trying to name the park after Sal Carpio.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But when I came to the neighborhood, John was one of the people that stepped up and said, Wait a minute, what about the legacy of people from this community? And again, at that time, I didn't know about sales history of having grown up in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then John urged that we include the name Sanguinary. And so the next few meetings we had, we invited Mary and her family to come and join us. And, you know, the the family the Carpio family was like, well, should we, you know, look at another park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, it made sense for this all to come together because this is what we do. This is who Sal was, right? Always bringing people together and trying to find a positive solution. And so we did the research on the saying when any family included that in the application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think Debbie and her husband Louis for being here. And Mary, you and your daughter for your efforts in helping us to, you know, pass the word out to the entire community. So, again, I just want to thank you all for your efforts in bringing this forward and just urge my colleagues to vote in support of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this park naming. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Wayne, New York.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Councilwoman Ortega for bringing this forward and for having Heinz for supporting the name of this park. And it's always so much fun for me to to hear about the history of Denver, and especially important tonight here about two important families to Denver and what contributions the families have made to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Denver. And I love hearing it from the families, especially when it doesn't come from Councilman Flynn. So. So we. But I just do. I want to thank you so much for your families, for the contribution you have made for dinner and dinner and for a sound car for you and his his leadership of the city council on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and seeing. We have these pictures on the wall back there and you see the old I want to say the old the most important the leaders of our city. Oh, city councilman listed there and pictured. And it's always fun to see those leaders and the importance they made to our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just really want to thank you and all the families for their contribution. And I look forward to supporting this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. And Councilman new, um, councilman Paul Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know what they put in their coffee that they made in a good mood. The first person I want to thank is Councilman Ortega. Councilman Ortega has been steadfast in making sure that Sal has been honored in this city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hmm. You began doing this a long time ago. And, you know, there were a lot of different things that we could have. We could have honored Sally with. But Councilman Carpio with Butt Park is amazing. Park is a place of peace.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A place of unity. I. And it's a place of beauty. And that's the legacy that I believe Councilman Carpio left. I only got to know him when I was coming on board on council. And he. I was leaving.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council but I mean us going going to have. And he wrote me. This letter. And I all I know is that here's this dude with. I mean, he's older guy, but with his hair fully in there and still black and still had grassa like stabbed the grease.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. And I thought to myself, I like this guy. I want to be him when I'm old. Right. And he once I met him once or twice, he shook my hand, you know. And then I got this letter, this random letter, and, you know, who writes letters to us anymore, like actually ran or written.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We get a lot of emails and we get too many. But we don't get letters anymore like we used to. And I have this handwritten letter that he he gave me, and I saved it. And he's still around.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, this is 2011. He still around. But for some reason, I saved this letter and it was handwritten and hangs on my wall, hangs on my wall and counts like a big old corkboard. And it hangs there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm a reader because I think it's just it's just his words. Again, he's alive. Right. And and he says, Councilman Paul Lopez, I want to send you this note to thank you for your consideration and effort to have my name placed upon the Human Services Building in East Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was one of the things that we were working on in the past year. What there's this humbles his humble part comes out and he says, I will understand the dynamics and pitfalls of such an effort. And although it was not successful this time, your sincere effort and consideration on our behalf is indeed an honor beyond words'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And he says, thank you very much. I wish you continued success in your pursuit and improving. Knows we must improve the quality of life for the working people. The poor and the elderly. Thanks. Sincerely, Sal Carpio. And that's who I know he fought for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's who we still fight for. Because the city isn't successful and unless those folks are successful. No last minute. Only communication I really had with him was those words. And when you talk about this legacy that's passed on, it's compassion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not complex. It's to not leave each other behind. Right. And if I might get you more in detail, Councilman Santos. Is that you really don't become a council person until you take the oath? They took it together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I like to say that all their I may be elected one right after the other. They took them together. And you can't be what you cannot see. And when you fight so hard in our community. We've struggled, especially in the Chicano community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've struggled to get our name, people, I mean, things named after our people. And unlike some times, it's easier. I hate to say this, but. There's a difference when you're trying to name something under a Chicano. You met with a lot of resistance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You have to struggle for it. You got to go through extra red tape. And we're always struggling to name things after our people. Not our struggle, but the resistance that we that we have. And I'm glad to see that there is no resistance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There you are. We are about to name this part of. Carpio Sanguinetti after great people that reflect who we are as a city. And so when, you know, we feel we get a lot of folks saying, you're changing the history of city, you're changing our city, our sisters, the cities disappearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they come here desperate at every rezoning, saying, Please save our city. What are you doing? Don't do that. They freak out, right? Because this is the history that we're trying to preserve. Right. These kind of things, these kind of people, these kind of efforts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as Denver grows, it can not forget its history. And so these are the builders of the city, literally the builders of the city. And I just think it is long overdue. And I just wish one thing. I wish.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman sound out, Councilman Santos, too, because we did this a couple of years ago. I wish Councilman Carpio was here to hear this. I think we have an antiquated law colleagues. I think it's so antiquated that they can't be here to say to hear the thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need a change in seven years. Some people make their legacy right off the bat. We don't got to wait seven years to tell somebody thank you in person. So if I might say this. Think about the names in our parks and I'll read this through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is just an effort in a community. Johnny Martinez. Some sandals, just a passport. Are buildings. Public spaces. Gonzalez. Castro. Flores. Chavez. Sanchez. Cisneros. Pena Sandoval. And now Carpio. So with that, I want to say thank you all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a good day, a good night for our community and a great night for our city. You, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks for President. I really wasn't going to get into any history, but challenged by councilman knew. I'm going to have to now. I want to make note. It's really appropriate to to single out this piece of ground, not only for Sal, but also for the Sanguinary family, because the history down valley downriver is a history of agriculture'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the history of production from the land. And to see this piece of land enter into an official city park with the joint names of Sanguinary Family and Sal Carpio is very, very fitting and it's very historical. It's not just to memorialize a a city councilman, but to memorialize part of the culture and fabric of what built'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this state. And in the beginning, that was agriculture. It later and possibly because of the sanguinary family and their campaign to clean up the river. The in this is my historical note for this remark during the New Deal, during the Depression in the mid thirties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The North Side treatment plant was built there precisely to clean up the river and after that plant opened, people all the way down through Greeley and Weld County. The mortality rates dropped from such things as enteritis and other diseases, from drinking dirty water.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and now to see the remnant of that plant become part of the fabric of the park really, really ties this land and its legacy in a very visual, practical, physical way. I think it's really fitting that, Tim, that you're here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I meant to ask during questioning. I didn't ring in in time. But I don't know if you are the only son of a councilman. Son of a councilman to or daughter of a councilman or for that matter, ever to be elected to council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think I think you are. And when when I started here in 1981, your dad and Sal were on on the council. And I think it's fitting to recognize Salma for not only for a lot of his physical accomplishments that we can view on council and at DIA, at the housing authority, but also because of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cultural shift that the coalition that your dad and Sal and others built on the council really led to some fundamental changes in how this council, which is basically a weak council, relates to the administration. And we can thank we can thank them for what is now the mind numbing task of having to read all contracts, over half'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a million dollars, because that was a reform that came in because of the Group of Seven that eventually was formed. I had I had the opportunity to visit last week over at the home of Cathy Donahue. And we were talking some stories about Sal and your dad and and Bill Roberts and and all the other folks, Cathy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Reynolds, who eventually formed the coalition that managed to get those charter reforms in place so that the council could be a little more a little bit more of a watchdog over the administration. And those are the accomplishments I remember.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I won't remember such things as as Sal and not so much your dad, but mostly Bill Roberts making me very late on deadline, my metro deadline, while I was sitting over the press tables saying, come on, come on, come on, you know, let's cut it, Mr. President, please cut them off.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're cut off. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But. But you're right. They raised a generation of other leaders. Sal, I met I met Councilwoman Ortega in the early eighties when she was the aid for for Sal and I met Ramona martinez who followed your father in on in the West Denver seat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think your dad paid his aide out of his own pocket at first because there were no council aides in the seventies when Sam and Sal were elected together as the first Latino members of city council and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just the reforms that they that they managed to push through really affect the way we operate today. And I think that's the legacy that I will think of when I vote I tonight on this bill. And congratulations on your dad also.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that to have Sergeant Carpio, Sanguinetti Park and Mile Sam Santos Park dedicated in the same year is really a fitting tribute to those those two people going through this council. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Flynn, I'm glad you chimed in to tell us the history that you did, because I got to have my mind blown a little bit that I now understand what it is that you're looking for. And it's a historical designation has absolutely no trace of anything other than a sewage plant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, all kidding aside, thank you, Councilman Lopez, for sharing the note. I know I've gotten something similar from different people, but I wish I had gotten that note. And I might ask you to, if you will please copy it and share it with me, because there's some wisdom, there's a lot of wisdom there that is born from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'obviously his time doing serving in those multiple roles on council and take that on. I'd be lucky if I ever sort of figure out who you can see. I struggle with that level of understanding of what it is that we're doing here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But anyway, the only reason I'm sitting at this dais in one of those seats that he occupied is is a direct result of that R.A. legislation that he moved forward. You know, I was just a resident in a neighborhood that had a problem with the way things that the city was doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And me and other neighbors formed an R.A. as a way to fight in that. And we had a representative, Debbie Ortega, at the time where we knew that we had a fighting chance if we could make the case to her.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that represented sort of the everything that was depicted here, which is the ability for the neighbors to have that power of that organization, have standing in the city and have a representative that comes from a place where people matter, people, individual constituents matter more than the special interests that are that are really driving this train'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And, you know, so we won. We lost some, too. But we fought. And we we always felt like we had a skin in the game. And and that success in through different registered neighborhood organizations sort of put me as an individual on on people's map.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anyway back to how I even really I my relationship with the Carpio family. Sorry, did I say Sanders again? Sorry. My relationship with your family is. Is different than this council connection. But when you run in North Denver, there are a lot of old families there that have been multigenerational, involved in politics and in various sorts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you do not run without hearing both those names actually, and becoming very familiar. And so we've been able to sort of connect the dots early. When I got here, when Councilwoman Ortega was talking about moving forward, this legislation, which is fraught with some of the concerns and difficulties and challenges that Councilman Lopez mentioned, you know, I'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was sympathetic and had a better understanding of how how everything sort of plays itself out. And I am so. But I just want to say that that, you know, you know that what's gone on in the last 40 years isn't the entire story of Globeville and that land is the part of the entire story of Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to have made that connection to the same genetic family was to me. The thing that that that I love most about this is to sort of for the future in perpetuity for us to have that acknowledgment that we had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had this. This is this vast plains. That was then. Wrangled by people cultivated and turned into something that was bountiful. Man did its thing, sort of led it to decay. Different forces came in and we said, No, we're going to create change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it all sort of just it's just the narrative of Denver from that 150 year history to the more recent sort of the history that we're talking about to what is now being discussed as the future, the next hundred years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be able to point to to create this moment to to to honor both those families. At this point I'm sorry, Councilwoman Brooks, but now, unfortunately, I'm going to be able to go. You're doing this in the shadow of the Sanguinary Carpio Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's going to mean something, because that's going to talk about the agricultural legacy, that's going to talk about the community activism and voice. And so I just I'm just blessed. I'm rambling and I get to ramble and I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I just wanted you guys to know that I am very, very happy to be in this position to vote yes on this particular naming application. And I'm so looking forward to it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I. It's such an exciting night. And I think the coolest thing about this is twofold for me. One, this is one of my favorite parks in all of Denver. And as a guy who spent 17 years working on parks, not saying a lot because I spent a lot more time in a lot of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'parks than most people. I can remember the first day that I stumbled upon this park working on the South Platte River and just, you know, you can't be in this space and not feel like it is it is just such a special place and such a space that the community has owned in a way that many parks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'don't have that ownership. And so this is the perfect thing to do. The naming process is one of the most community driven things that we do. I want to give, you know, a shout out and thanks to Councilwoman Ortega and Councilman Brooks, but really a shout out to all of you who who did the work and put'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the time to bring this forward, to get the signatures, to do the work and to put these two families name on this park just really cements it as that much more of a special place. And so I want to say thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. And congratulations. I'm very happy to support this tonight. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to chime in and add my congratulations to both the San Juan, Eddie and Carpio families. I was not pals with South Korea. I spoke with him once or twice early in my career as a news guy around the Neighborhood Notification Ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just remember him as being nice and direct and gave me the info that I needed. You know, I love that this is not South Carpio Park and it's not Sanguinary Park. I love that it's Carpio Sanguinary, as was said before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, not only does it reflect on the neighborhood and its history, but the fact that the capos didn't dig in their heels and say, Oh, no, it's got to be Carpio Park and Sanguine Ateez were were happy to join in this celebration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the other thing I wanted to say to them, probably many, many people in this city who have never been to what will soon be named the Carpio sanguinary part. I truly think this may be the most unique park I've ever been to in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, with the remnants of the treatment facility there, it is a landscape unlike any other green space that I visited in our city. So if I were part of the families, I'd be real pleased with this choice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, this is this is not just a blank green lawn with a few trees and benches. This landscape is just evocative of our past. You walk along and you look at the walls and plazas and it's your mind just starts going, Well, we could do this here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why don't we do that? I mean, it's a great space. So, again, congratulations and I will look forward to supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Kathryn, Councilman are taking you back up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. I just wanted to mention two very brief things. The first is that this park is not dedicated and it's not yet because it's part of the 100 acre master plan with Heron Pond and the Heller property. And also because as National Western is looking at doing, there are two roads that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Will connect to the river and eventually go straight over to Washington Street. There's a chance that. Part of the parking lot on the south end of this park may be. You know, it may be absorbed as part of the roadway as it comes to the other side of the river.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the last thing I want to mention is that this information from this process tonight and maybe even a record of tonight's meeting can now be added to the archives that are at the Denver Public Library on Sal Carpio, which will also recognize the contributions of the Singularity family.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that will be awesome to have this information added to all the other information on the many projects and contributions that Councilman Sal Carpio made. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Seeing no other comments, this being the district I represent, I just want to say a couple comments. Number one, councilwoman are take a valiant effort. You've been talking about this for a while. We've been meeting about this for a while.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you so much for getting this going. And the community did a great job and getting all the signatures to the single nati family. And congratulations. This is a way to to to really honor the history. I mean, fifth generation, fifth generation here in the Globeville neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's just incredible. And the only thing I regret about the Sal Carpio is that he couldn't be here to see it. I mean, I've read about the legend of Sal Carpio, but the first time I met him was at a redistricting meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You remember this? We're at tradition. Redistricting. We are so excited to meet him. And he put his finger in my chest and said.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You better support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lopez, this map.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we didn't get started off on the right foot. But he's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's so passionate about his community. And it was this this map that we ended up supporting was taken a part of District nine, which he represented. And I always respected the fact that he didn't even know me, but still checked me very clearly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. And in Councilwoman, as we look back on, you know, the Human Services building, you remember this? Oh, yes. And we and we talked to I wish that we could have done something with the Human Services Building that remains unnamed today right there on Bruce Randolph for for Mr. Carpio.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This has been beautiful to hear from you all as a community. And I am excited. Though we're about to change the name to sing. When Erica Carpio sang. When Madam Secretary Rocco.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ORTEGA Hi, Black. Clark Hi. Espinosa Hi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Flynn Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gilmore I heard. Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Carnage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lopez. I knew. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I please close voting, announce the results. Lebanese 11 eyes. The park name passes. It is now Carpio saying. Excellent.'"
