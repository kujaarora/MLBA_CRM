        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. I first met Mike about four years ago. When, of course, we were having flooding problems in my district, the Upper Montclair Basin. First thing he just suggested was let's meet with the maybe with the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course he did. He was great at it. We met with about 30 neighbors one evening, some having experienced flooding in their homes, some having cars that had floated down the street. Some with people in them. The mood was very tense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I then watched this Mike Anderson suit the whole atmosphere in the room. His straight talk and empathic manner was an experience to see and hear. I started writing down not just the things he was saying, but the way he was saying them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Realizing I could learn a lot from this guy about effective and sensitive communication. You see, he really only had bad news for the neighbors that night. Only bad news. It was going to be more than 20 years before the city could get around to fixing the problem of that flooding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He did say Intel, what they were doing in the meantime to get ready to address the issues. But. But even with bad news, the back and forth went smoothly. And remarkably, remarkably, as neighbors were leaving that meeting, they were satisfied content, understood the issues and laughing with each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I never saw anything like it. And since then, I've watched him do it over and over again with neighbors. So I have decided to name him officially The Constituent Whisperer, and I am very pleased to do this proclamation tonight and urge my fellow councilmen to vote for this proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Cohen. Each.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my colleague bringing this forward. I think I met Mike closer to six years ago, shortly after I got elected. And there is an area that constituents is a little bit different. It wasn't so much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The reaction is more is the visioning phase where constituents had a vision for a brownfield and they'd had the experience of the city saying, no, it seemed too hard. And it but yet at the same time, there was a flooding study that seemed to indicate that in this area we needed some kind of city investment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I volunteered to try to help them kind of gather multiple departments together. And my simple appreciation to Mike was for being the first person to say, Yeah, that might make sense. If we're going to have to spend money there any way we might be able to do it in a way that actually meets these community'",
        "'speaker_4': 'vision ideas and wow, wouldn't that make sense rather than kind of thinking separately about our city infrastructure? And so although it wasn't his project to lead and Parks ended up taking the lead, it was him saying, yes, we will be having to invest in this area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if we had others that were bringing money to the table and had a vision for how to do that, it might make sense. And so it gave me the hope to continue working on it. It might take another six or seven years until we get to a groundbreaking who knows?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These things have a very long horizon, thus the patience that Councilwoman Susman described being so valuable. But I just you know, so I got to say, you know, there's always a reason why something's hard and there's always ten reasons why it might not work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I appreciate you being the first interaction. I had to say, yes, we should think about this and it could be possible and it could be come together. And really that helped to kick start something that's now becoming a real project, which is the platform Open Space in Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you on behalf of those residents in that community for for saying yes to some creative thinking and to keep us moving in that direction. And I wish you the best in your retirement. Thank you so much for all your service to the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. So it's always great when you work with people in the city that you agree with and you work together hand in hand to accomplish projects. That was has not been my experience with Mike.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our interaction has been as much on projects that I disagreed with as those that I agreed with. And I think that's those times where we were in disagreement is where I think I saw the character that people are talking about with Mike.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that wasn't about politics, it was about public service and public safety. And he expressed a respect for my opinions, though, being steadfast in his as well. And as far as expertize in the area of city drainage projects, I'm quite sure that his expertize exceeds mine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it was an experience that I enjoyed. You know, there's been a couple of people that have left the city recently that I just feel cheated about. You know, I got I've had a brief couple of years to work with Mike and Mr. Broad well before him and some others who have gone on to other pursuits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I as well would like to wish you a wonderful retirement. Mike and Mike was in my office earlier this afternoon, and you just need to appreciate how thoroughly uncomfortable I'm sure he is hearing people talk about what a fine job he's done for the city because he's as humble a human being as he is a skilled'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I think I'd like to invite Mr. Mike Anderson to the podium.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, counsel. Thank you. Thank you very much. I am humbled by this. I look around and I was thinking all day about the various districts that I've worked in just about all across the city. And. It's really neat and rewarding for me to drive around the city and say, Oh, I remember that problem that's fixed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fixed. There are some that are going to take a long time, but it's really rewarding to see things that are fixed from southwest Denver to north east Denver and all points in between. I want to thank your city council and all of your aides.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank the prior city council and all of their aides. It's great to see Councilman Robb here. I haven't seen her since she retired. The legislative analyst staff has been wonderful to work with and the mayor's office as well, especially Diane and Skye.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank, obviously, my father, who was a civil engineer. He never pushed me into engineering. He allowed all of us children to choose our own path when I don't know if any of you ever remember seeing the flier that we sent out, but there was a cartoon at the bottom from Calvin and Hobbes about a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thriving little city in a sandbox, and tragically, it laid beneath Hoover Dam. And he's got a little bucket. And that was me as a kid, you know. And when I'm about seven years old, we had an oak tree.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No grass grew underneath it. I would carve out this little settee and drive my matchbox cars through the city, and then I'd take the dirt and I build a dam and I'd fill it with a hose, and then I'd blow up the dam and flood the town.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am I, you know, and in the summers we play in the in the pool and in the river, and I dam up the gutter and the snowmelt. And, you know, it's when I went away to college and ended up getting an offer with the L.A. County Flood Control District, my family said, Yeah, that's Mike.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's Mike. So I said, I want to thank my father for his guidance. I grew up with Civil Engineering magazine. I got a C on a physics exam one night and he I was in tears and he said, don't worry, I never use it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that gave me some comfort. My mom, my sister, my brother, my aunts and my uncles and my grandparents, who are all hardworking farmers, they instilled in me a sense of a work ethic and a sense of honesty, which I think has come through in the meetings to always be honest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my teachers that I grew up with, an elementary school, high school, oddly enough, the ones that probably had the biggest impact on me or my English teachers, Mr. Foresman and Mrs. Belsky and Mrs. Adams, that taught me how to write because I've met a lot of engineers who can, and I counseled a couple of engineers that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'were graduating from SIU recently and and I said, You can be the best engineer in the world, but if you can't communicate in writing or in a presentation, it ain't going to happen. So how are your communication skills?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My friends that have supported me through my ups and downs of my life, there have been downs. It hasn't all been great. There have been some real down times, but my friends and my family and my mentors have gotten me through those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope they're. Oh, hi, mom. Hi, Lisa. They're watching tonight. I forgot. And my coworkers, Bruce and Jennifer and Ron are here with me in the audience tonight. They've been absolutely wonderful to work with, and they give me the confidence to retire knowing that the next generation of engineers are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're young. They're energetic. They have new ideas. They have a lot of computer skills that I admittedly don't have. I sometimes feel like a dinosaur. I know what I want and I know how to get it. But they can actually do it, and so can my consultants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And last but not least, I want to thank my partner Marcus here tonight for all of his support through all the years and all the community meetings and all the angst and talking me down afterwards when the adrenaline is running for an hour and a half.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sure you all have experienced that as well. So each and each and all of you have contributed a piece of yourselves to me and nurtured me along the way and created the person who stands here before you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's nothing I did myself. It's everyone that I've named and how that named. But name by name. So I'm really I really feel truly blessed to have had inspiring teachers growing up and supportive friends and family and colleagues and guidance from so many to give me such a rich and rewarding career.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, counsel. As Councilman Nu mentioned, we had hoped that Roger would be able to watch this presentation, but nonetheless, I believe he is with us tonight, although now he is witnessing the honor in spirit a little beyond Channel eight, our earthly viewing system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I want you to know that as Councilwoman Kennish said, it is so important to all of us that you have taken the time to honor Roger because of our admiration and love for him. I had remarks in mind before I heard of his death Saturday, but still the main thing I wanted to say still applies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would have mentioned that Roger excelled in his quiet way at networking artists, band leaders, retailers, developers, restaurant owners, liquor store owners, marijuana shop owners, social service agencies, city and state officials, even volunteers, neighbors, you name it. He knew them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He knew someone in the field. But what I really want to concentrate on is that, above all, he was a friend. I lost my own husband in 2000, and at the time I was serving on the board of the Temple Events Center uptown, where Roger was the executive director.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And man, he was just there. He was just quietly there. You knew he got it. Didn't make a big deal of anything. But there he was, steady. And he was one of the first people to hear me contemplate running for council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And later at our annual lunch, he'd hear about my quandaries in trying to balance neighborhood business, citywide issues. And I know he was there for many people like me, listening, nodding, supporting us as we faced quandaries, loss and success.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Cathy, I hope we can be there for you, too. I've often said that District ten council people are lucky to have an organization like Chun because it's so fairly intelligently balances all points of views and communications early and often with the Council district tin rep.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I will say he was smart enough to have some trepidation and also some strong expectations before he took on that role and we talked about it. You can't be a neighborhood leader without facing just a little controversy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Roger faced it quietly without creating more controversy. And I think the line from the story project guy Brian Andreas that anyone can slay a dragon but try waking up every morning and loving the world all over again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what takes a real hero. And to me, Roger was a hero citizen. I wish everybody could be a citizen like Roger Armstrong who cared so deeply for this community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Like Michael Henry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Thank you. My my name is Michael Henry. I'm a past long time board member and early president of Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods. I don't know why, but I feel compelled to think about how Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods has been a great incubator of public servants.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Two of our original founders were. Congresswoman Pat Schroeder and Councilwoman Cathy Donahue. And after that, after Councilwoman Donahue retired. Councilman Ed Thomas had been on our board and Councilwoman Robb had worked with us and been on our board and then also councilman knew it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Could I just ask everybody who's here especially to thank and honor Roger, just to raise your hands? There are an awful lot of us. Here. Who want to do that? In particular, she does not wish to speak. But Roger's wife, Cathy Lopez, is here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Brad Cameron and I went to see Rodger Friday afternoon about 4:00, and we told him about this proclamation and he knew about it. And the words that he had for were. I am so humbled. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mike. Charles Nussbaum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, counsel. My name is Charles Nussbaum, and I've known Roger for probably six or eight years, most closely as the immediate past president of John. A role I had for three years, and only a few people can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Claim that. Anyway, I want to thank everyone close to Roger for allowing his time and contributions. Tirelessly to help advocate for everybody in this community. It's unbelievable. How one person can be so close in touch with the reality of so many levels of our society.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He will be greatly missed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was a pleasure and an honor to know him. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Charles. Dave Wallstrom.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They Wallstrom, longtime friend and colleague of Roger Armstrong. Thank you for the proclamation. It was wonderfully. It was recorded. Thank you for the help wording. The proclamation. You guys. And thank you for this forum to allow public expression of our love and respect for for Roger.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that the way and the manner in which Roger went about serving our community. Can be instructive to others. Roger earned and gained the respect and the truck and the support of others because he always gave people his respect.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To them upfront. And he demonstrated his respect by listening. Truly listening. And by listening. He created common ground to discuss just about any topic that was on the table. And I don't know if people were always aware about how Roger worked in terms of respecting people, listening to them and creating common ground.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that's how he worked. And he was terribly successful at that. Wonderfully successful. Roger also knew the first order of leadership, which is to serve. You know that. And that was his gift of leadership to our community. Losing Roger leaves a hole in our hearts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This will heal in time. But for now, maybe our sadness behooves us to become more attuned to life fragility enough so as to recalibrate our priorities in life a bit. And how we treat others, whether that be family or friends or members of our community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of this. I'm sure Roger loved this place better than he found it. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I found him to be one of the best leaders that I've ever worked under. The one thing about Roger, he gave everybody a voice. He listened to everybody and cared about what they said. And gave them room to prove himself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And he sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Did that with me. I. Have you seen two executive directors leave us since? I've worked at the People's Fair, and it's really heartbreaking for me to stand up here and talk to you all about him. I know there's many more people that have want to speak.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just want to say. I love you, Roger. And you'll be missed. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much, city council. Speaking of slaying a dragon, my name is Aaron Yoshimura and I'm the former executive director for the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival. And Roger has done so much for so many large organizations. And I want you to know that he also carved out time to help a dinky little organization get on its'",

        "'speaker_4': 'He not only shared his rich experience in event production, but also provided leadership in forming the future of the festival. His selflessness made a huge impact on the board, and his leadership paved a new path for those of us who had the opportunity to opportunity to work with him.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then these are my words. I actually expected to tell them this in person. Roger, when you stepped on the board, you stepped on the board as board chair in 2008 and I joined in 2010. You didn't really know me, but you certainly took me under your wing and mentored me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You helped me navigate a lot of the many facets of festival production. I always appreciated how calm and cool you were. You were so unflappable. You were my rock to lean on and get me through the turbulent times.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And while you taught me a lot, you always made space for me to find my own answers. I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me and for the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival. You may have been my rock, but you always have a soft space in my heart.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whether you know it or not or will admit it or not. You made a huge contribution to the festival and have left an indelible mark on all of us who had the privilege of knowing you. On behalf of the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival, board staff, volunteers and community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. We are forever grateful and I brought some flowers for you and I made sure that they weren't overly colorful, so not to embarrass you. So, Cathy, if you would please accept the flowers on behalf of the Colorado Dragon Boat Festival, I appreciate it.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We each must be ready, willing and able to let go, no matter what we have done or how we have lived. We are here for a finite time as sentient beings. We are here. But a brief time. Essentially, we pass in a flickering of a candle, leaving little trace of our presence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What we do with this gracious moment makes all of the finite difference in how we are remembered. If we make others feel better and be more alive, then we are immortal. Success is not judged by what we do, but by our impact on the world we share.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Never be afraid to catapult into the unknown, to offer the best and lose one's way to fail utterly and remain steadfast. This is the gift of being alive. Our mission is to being focused on never squandering anything that we are given.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Being fulfilled in the presence of the divine in us. And as individual spirits on earth. We're connected vitally throughout the passages of time, both aft and thereafter, without limits, reservations or turning back. When we have assessed the worth of our touring outpouring, we realize that there is no way to lose.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Forget what we have and where we come from. That makes us possible in the early moments of our creative presence. We are present to a greater stillness that resides in our being awake. Listening. Of being free. In our approach to all that is sacred.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that we have. And from which we have originated. There is this. Time here. What we have become from the moment we are conceived, we are a blessing to every place, every way, ever intersection of hope and love that defines our way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is no turning back, no turning round, no place of refuge. We verily must let go of the suffering, the loss, the adversity of being here, reflecting, integrating the mysteries of being alive, of being chosen to be and to have and hold the field, to deliver, to come to know that we have made a covenant with all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'life, that we are related across time was brought bands of waves that lap against the shore that bring the nutrients here that made our presence matter. For these gifts possibilities. We are eternally rewarded with a legacy of substance, of intention, of faith that this is what we have been called upon to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All when he's, no matter how we are living, juxtaposed helplessly how much of the or little we use of the natural resources to which we are heir to. We are partners in the great sea of creating, donating, of giving, for giving of certainty that every participle, every obstacle, every way is sacred, that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No matter whether we are tossed and shattered against the stony. We're. We are here. We belong. We matter. Amen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Randall. Thank you. Our thoughts are with you and thank you for all the speakers. And thank you all for being here on a roger tonight. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
