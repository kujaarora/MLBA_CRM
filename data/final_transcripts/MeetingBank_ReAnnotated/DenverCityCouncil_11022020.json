They weren't meeting very much during the summer due to COVID. So normally this is a very active, registered neighborhood organization and fortunately they were not meeting.'",

And it is a unique situation in northwest Denver where we have these zoned lots and these parcel lots that are longer and have these old dwelling units on the back when people didn't need as much room as they do nowadays.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so Sally will be building her primary house in the front and then turn her house that she's currently been living in into an accessory dwelling unit, which I think is a great resource for our neighborhood and a great way to keep our missing little housing stock in northwest Denver.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Friend Same sort of question I had on the prior one, and that is as I look at the property and I didn't see in the staff report. Exactly. Of course, then you wouldn't until site development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The setbacks. It looks to me like the garage that's there already might not be within the required setback, which is 12 feet off the alley when there is an alley. And it looks to me like it's right on right on the alley right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when this is rebuilt, is there sufficient spare space between the primary residence and the the footprint that you would build on? And maybe the applicant could address that as well? And it seems to me it would have to be a new structure, would have to be 12 feet off the alley right of way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's one thing I wanted to note. So kind of like a new thing that we're doing now with the few applications that we're getting because we get so many is that at the time of the pre-application, we asked the applicants to have a meeting with development services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that meeting basically we tell them this there's no need for them to hire an architect or have proper drawings, but they can have just like a drawing in a napkin. So exactly for what you're asking. So because we don't want anyone to reason and then find out they can build whatever they need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we go process. It's required by code and it's not not everyone has to do it. But but we always side by side because then we don't want people to waste $1,000 and the rezoning and figure out, okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this has been through that and we're okay on that score.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to take that with me, but I think so because we get it. So like I think that maybe if you can answer that need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, sure. So I have not gone through that process and if it's 12 feet, then I've just wasted $1,000. And my understanding was that it was five feet. But but there is actually enough room to build add you know an 80 you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In our backyard. The question then is just whether or not we actually do it. But and so. Yeah. Okay. Rear setback, Ali, 12 feet on the in the staff report. All right. Thank you. That's all I have. Madam President.'",
