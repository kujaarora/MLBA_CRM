        "'speaker_1': 'First thing we have up is Council Bill 768 as amended. Councilman Flynn, will you please put seven 8768 as amended on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 768, as amended, be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And wait for technology to catch up. And we are still inputting the names in the system. So we will keep that going so that we can just keep the process moving. Council Bill 768, as amended, approves a zoning map amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Council is required by law to conduct public hearings on zoning map amendments, and Council's actions are subject to a court review in order to provide a record for court review. Testimony is recorded and any items placed to the council are marked as exhibits and become part of the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The public hearing for accountability. 768, as amended, is open. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, President Herndon, members of the City Council, and Barbara Stockman, steely principal planner for Landmark Preservation. I will be presenting this case for the staff. So this is a landmark designation that is not owner initiated. Ideally, owners are the ones who are applying for landmark designation, and that's been the case for most designations in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But also in Denver, you can have three persons who are residences, residence and or property owners or have a place of business in Denver. And that is the case here. This case was initiated from a certificate of not historic status.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A certificate of non historic status is application by the owner or their designee for certification that a property is not historic which allows it to be demolished for up to a period of up to five years. In this case, here we are at the Green Box, which is the city council, a public hearing decision because it is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a designation case that came out of a certificate of non historic status. The City Council decision and the action must be completed within 120 days, which in this case is Thanksgiving Day. As indicated, this case came out of a certificate of non historic status.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's one of two designation applications that are being processed out of 592, that of certificates and demolitions that we've reviewed this year. So it's actually a pretty small number. This case is it 23, 29, Elliott or 23, 23 West 23rd Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's in Council District one in the Jefferson Park neighborhood. The property as initially submitted by the applicants, it was included. BLOCK 34 lost 24 and 25 in the South, ten feet of Lot 26, which was 8400 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The applicant was four property owners and the property owner is James son Lightner, who is opposed. At first reading, the boundary of the designation was modified to B block 30 for the easterly 80 feet of lots 24 and 25 and the easterly 80 feet of south ten feet of construction, which would be a 4480 square foot parcel'",
        "'speaker_5': ', are 53% of the original designation boundary as shown on this map. The reduced designation boundary is part of a almost 20,000 square foot assemblage by the property owner and the proposed designation area is 23% of the land area in this assemblage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As shown on the attached map. These are photographs of the house here. The one on the left is a street view of the house from Elliott Street going north, and the other is a front view of the house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are additional photos of the house. The one on the left side shows the some of the south side of the house. These photos here. The photo on the left is from the south alley, showing the south side of the house and part of the rear of the house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The upper photo on the right is taken from the carriage lot showing the back of the house and the non historic garage. That's not included in the reduced designation boundary. Again, we are at the second reading and the designation deadline is November 26.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Landmark Preservation Commission held a public hearing. There was posting signage for the hearing. There were owner notifications and letters. Registered neighborhood organizations were notified as well as city council members. Staff has met with the owners representatives and has also met with the designation applicants and have communicated regularly with parties from both sides.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The application gave the name to the House as the William W Anderson House. The House is a circa 1888 to 1890 House. The proposal is to designate as a landmark structure as recommended by the Landmark Commission. It would be based on history, designation criteria and history c.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An architecture a. Under Chapter 30 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code, a property to be designated as a structure for designation is required to maintain its historic and physical integrity to to meet one designation criteria and two or more of the following categories history, architecture and geography.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And three relate to a historic context or theme. So number one is the ordinance says a property must maintain its historic and physical integrity. And then it goes into more detail and it says what that means. It's not really the physical condition of the house per se, but it's the ability of the structure to convey its historic'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and architectural significance in being recognized as belonging to a particular time and place. And Denver's history and the seven qualities that define integrity per the ordinance are location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling and association. The landmark staff in the Landmark Commission both found that the House maintains its historic and physical integrity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's largely intact. It has minor alterations and has integrity. The second criteria is that the property must meet one designation criteria in two or more of the following categories. Category one Its history property has to be 30 years old and shall c have direct and substantial association with a person or group of persons who had influence on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'society. This was the criteria that the Landmark Commission felt was met under history, that the House was the home of William W Anderson. Anderson associate is associated with Alfred Packer. Packer was infamous for his sentence of manslaughter, for killing and allegedly eating other members of an expedition party traveling between Provo and Breckenridge in early 1874.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He was very, very well known. Various accounts there are various accounts regarding Anderson's exact association or relationship with Packer. Some of the stories have indicated that Anderson actually did represent Packer. Others say that he was hired by Bonfils and Taman from the Denver Post to free Packer, but then he misrepresented himself to Packer, and there's various other'",
        "'speaker_5': 'renditions of that story. But clearly he did visit Packer. Clearly there was some relationship with him and Packer and Bonfils and Hammett, as reported by many histories and accounts throughout the years. What we do know is that on January 13th, 1900, Anderson shot Henry Chapman and Frederick Bonfils, owners of the Denver Post, during an altercation at the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'post office over Anderson's representation of Alfred Packer. And The Denver Post attempts to free Packer and obtain exclusive rights to story. Local Stories Report. Anderson Living at 2329. ELLIOTT The day after the shooting, which is confirmed by city directories and U.S. Census data at the time of the shooting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And many of the pictures that are in the PowerPoint are from the newspaper stories of the day. The shooting made headlines around the United States, including The New York Times and San Francisco, and was a major a major saga, continuing saga.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Denver, Anderson, was tried in 1900 and twice in 1901. He was eventually acquitted of charter charges. He insisted that it was self-defense. Ten men and boxes were eventually indicted and convicted of bribery due to jury tampering on the trial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the trials, Packer, kind of on a separate track, was paroled in 1991. This is just some examples of the newspaper coverage of the day. This actually relates to the bribery charges of Born Free in Timmins. But there was I counted over 20 times that this story was in the the in various newspapers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it was probably more. More stories about the acquittal of Andersen. The in terms of having a direct and substantial association with a person or group of persons who had influence on society. Andersen is associated with Alfred Packer one way or the other, and Alfred Packer's pictures on the PowerPoint.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He's associated with Bonfils and Taman, eds and owners, the Denver Post and the events and the persons, including the related newspaper coverage. Trials, acquittals and convictions were high profile and influential events, including coverage of Andersen and his trial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second designation criteria that the landmark commission thought was met are determined was met with architecture to a embodies the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type. The house is queen and style architecture. It's a substantial example, particularly for Jefferson Park is a 2243 square foot house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's only one designated structure in Jefferson Park. It's a dramatic hilltop. Location, which sets it apart from other Queen Anne homes in the neighborhood. It has its asymmetrical, has it has multiple materials, decorative brick coursing, original wood windows and porches, wooden brackets, trim details, half timbered porch.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the decoration is pretty much original, with a few minor exceptions. The third criteria is to relate to a historic context or theme. The story of Anderson in the House relate to late 19th century Victorian architecture in northwest Denver and Jefferson Park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver journalism hidden history, including the Denver Post involvement with Packer Anderson, the notorious shootings, trials, acquittal and convictions and Alfred Packer. The letters and petitions received have been honestly a little hard to keep track of. I have some notes here, so hold on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually, I think I'm missing that part of my presentation. But so we up to the Lpsc public hearing. We had 12 letters of support and two letters of opposition. We have additional information from the owner, which is 89 additional letters of opposition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have additional information from the applicant received on November 16th, which is 53 additional letters of support. There are petitions of support provided by the applicants and the petition of opposition provided by the owners. They both have over 500 names on them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't have standards in Landmark for a petition, so we have some concerns just about the overall validity and consistency between the petitions. The applicant's petition has about 90% of the petitioners are Denver residents, and it was 53% for the for the owners.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And many of the applicants also kept track of how many were within a mile. And there was a pretty high percentage that were immediately adjacent to the within a mile of the property. The Landmark Preservation Commission, there's been some questions about the Landmark Commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're appointed by the mayor and they have nine members. They include professional historians and architectural historians. They're professionally trained. They are volunteers. The landmark Commission on Public Hearing allowed 10 minutes for the applicant and 10 minutes for the owner, which he delegated to his agent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were 35 spirit speakers and there was a three and a half hour plus public hearing, including deliberation. The LPC, the main discussion points is they felt the story of Anderson was part of the history and mythology of the West and it was an important story.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The nation was captivated by the altercation, which they thought was significant. They thought that Anderson's association with Bond Fee and Tasman's editors of the Denver Post and events relating to the shooting and trials is an important story. Anderson's association with Packer is significant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are few examples of historic Queen Anne Homes surviving in Jefferson Park, and this example is intact, has a high degree of integrity, is substantial with a spectacular setting. They talked a lot about it wasn't as ornate as high style Queen Anne Homes in Denver and US featured in coffee table books.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it's a very representative and prominent example of a middle class home from the late 19th century in Denver. And they thought it was an increasingly rare example in this part of the city. So the landmark commission recommendation was that it met the Denver landmark designation and criteria and chapter 30.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It maintains its historical physical integrity meets designation criteria and history wants and architecture to see and relates to a historic context or theme.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I apologize for that delays, Kenneth. Okay. So for this first public hearing, we have 40 speakers. And the way for those of you not familiar with the process, we tend to go for and against. So thank you for noting that and we apologize if we might have gone multiples, but if one tends to be more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for or against and those speakers tend to go at the end. So I'm a call up the first 5 a.m. ask that you make your way to the front pew so that we can try to have the process go through quickly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the first one is M Quinn. We could not read the first name, so we apologize for that. M Quinn, Jessica, our Alice Zita, Paul Lloyd, Scott Moore and Carrie Mock. So if you five could make your way to the front pew, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then, Quinn, I apologize for not knowing who exactly that was. You can begin your remarks as soon as you make your way to the podium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm Marilyn Quinn. Sorry about that. I live at 3249 West Fairview Place, about a mile from 2329 Eliot Street. I'm asking for your vote to designate the Anderson House a Denver landmark. My interest in preserving this House is not financial gain and it's not to prevent development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You've received letters and email messages and petitions from hundreds of Denver residents in support of landmark designation. Over 400 supporters signed online and paper petitions. More than 100 of whom live within a half mile of the Anderson House.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A few of these supporters are here tonight, but not all will speak. I'd like to ask all those here who support landmark designation of the Anderson House to stand and then sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Denver has some of the strictest landmark designation guidelines in the country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So far this year, 592 applications for demolition of potentially historic buildings have been reviewed, putting us on track for a 20% increase over last year. Most of these applications are approved this year. 34 properties. About 6% of those reviewed were determined to have potential historic significance and were posted for public comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of those, only two nominations were submitted and found worthy of landmark designation. That's about one half, one half of 1%. The Anderson House has met these strict Denver requirements. This House is our last link to a powerful story of justice triumphing over evil in early Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Anderson was a reputable lawyer who ran afoul of the yellow journalism of the Denver Post publishers. A jury ruled he acted in self-defense, but of greater importance today are the guilty pleas by Denver Post publisher Tillman, a court bailiff and a police magistrate for bribing the court against Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Denver cheered the purge of corruption from its courts. Mr. Anderson's story is important to me and to my community and should be preserved along with the House through landmark designation. For tonight, I hope you will consider as your constituents the over 400 people who have spoken so emphatically in support of landmark designation and that you will vote'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to keep this landmark that has stood in Jefferson Park for over 130 years. Thank you for your attention.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Ms.. Quinn. Jessica Lazaro. And you have 6 minutes of deferred. 3 minutes for an additional 3 minutes for you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Good evening. Members of council. My name is Jessica Serafino. Liz Day 1800 California Street, Suite 2600 Denver 202 and I represent Mr. Sun liner. Jim's here and he'll be speaking to you in a little bit. He's right there and he's at the center of this case this evening, but he'd like to wait until he hears'",
        "'speaker_5': 'from some other speakers. So we would like to pass out to you just some talking points. Clearly, if you'll indulgence, those are from the sites who are supporting Jim and who are against designation. So in the course of this dialog, the applicant have made this evening about everything but Jim's rights, about price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And now there's a so-called better offer that's alleged to be good enough to take Jim's rights away. But the question is good enough for you. And with all due respect, Jim is well equipped to make those decisions for himself, as any of you would be on a contract for the purchase of your home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We ask you, in your wisdom this evening, to not be distracted from the purpose that we're here. The purpose of the hearing this evening, which is to answer one question Does the community's interest in Jim's house outweigh Jim's property rights?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The code says that hostile designation should be limited to extraordinary circumstances, extraordinary architecture, an extraordinary history. And after reviewing this application, the LPC ultimately voted to refer to you this evening. They were conflicted about whether or not Jim's house met the basic threshold requirements for referral.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As you'll hear, they found that the architecture of Jim's house to be an example of vernacular. I had to look that up. Queen Anne style. And what that means is ordinary. And I'm no architect. But certainly Jim's house is not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The best example of ordinary queen in architecture in the city. Nevertheless, I'd also like to point out that there are many great examples in the packets that are in front of you, right in Jefferson Park that are along a river drive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I ask you to take a look at those photos. But nevertheless, we recommend that most of the members of the LPC are architectural experts. So we won't argue with that determination, but we would ask you to take a look in that packet at their determination.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And while they were making that and the comments, those are direct quotes that they clearly had the difficult difficulty with this questionable case. So we'd simply ask you to consider does even the best example of ordinary architecture meet the extraordinary threshold set out in your code?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Next, even if ordinary is somehow extraordinary, you are well equipped to determine whether a some loose association, to quote Ms.. Stockton's dealing with a swindler and an attempted murder is somehow extraordinary. In the press release from designation proponents, they say that the House highlights Denver's past in the age of yellow journalism.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But nothing happened in this House. Even The Denver Post, a central figure in the story that proponents are trying to tie to Jim's home, urged against designation of Jim's house. Lastly, in addition to considering the architecture and history, unlike the LPC, counsel considers much broader issues and implications in designating Jim's home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for example, if you find that Jim's house is the new benchmark for extraordinary history and extraordinary architecture, then you're likely to see an endless line of individuals concerned with growth in our city, and rightfully so, attempting to designate any building built before 1985 as a way to stop development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's already happening there. Applications coming in for that very purpose. So there's obvious pressure building in Jefferson Park, and we acknowledge that in other neighborhoods. Jim's seen that pressure firsthand. Jim's lived there for 40 years. He's not immune to the changes that you're hearing about from other neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And perhaps it's time for the planning department to address that growth through their very collaborative process that exists to do that. Planning and zoning is the proper venue to have these discussions, but historic preservation that take away Jim's property rights is not the right tool.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are many demolition permits issued for older homes prior to this case, and there are likely to be many issued after. But Jim's home isn't a tipping point. We would respectfully implore that it does not meet the threshold to take Jim's property against his will.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you very much for your time. We would very respectfully ask you to consider the real issue at hand, which is not the quality or even the existence of a so called offer for Jim that he has determined is not a good deal for him.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We believe you will do the right thing, because this case, the in this case, the community's interest in Jim's house does not outweigh his property rights. It is not extraordinary. And we would ask you to consider that it sets dangerous policy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So respectfully, please vote no.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Against this designation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. As I mentioned before, the public hearing started that we are required by law to conduct these and all actions are recorded as part of a public review and testimony. It was just brought to my attention that even though the green light is on, generally it is not recording this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are going to have to take a recess. Counsel My apologies until we can figure out Channel eight gets back up so that this testimony can be recorded. So I ask for your patience. We're going to have to do it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are we good now?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, yes. Let's proceed with the recess. We're trying to confirm whether it's being recorded at this point. That's that's the point that we're at. But, Don, we're not sure how long this may take, but we want to get it absolutely squared away before we resume with the testimony.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So with your indulgence, if you take a recess for us to get this figured out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll take it. We'll take a short recess and try to reconvene a moment soon. And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But you just heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The audience in the chambers. The Channel eight feed is down, however, Channel eight, so you won't be able to watch it on TV. We are streaming online and it is still recording. So that was the most important thing to know that we are still recording.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there is a testimony so we do not need to bring up the previous speakers as well. So our next speaker should be Paul Lloyd.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Members of Council. My name is Paul Cloyd. I live at 3033 Yates Street and have done so since 1984. I am a Colorado registered architect and professional engineer. I support this landmark designation of this Denver cultural asset.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'While I have no financial stake in the result of your decision, I do have a stake, I believe, as you do as well, and the quality of life, the sense of place and the sense of history for our city, my city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Denver, Colorado. On January day 1900, William Anderson walked down the steps, those red sandstone steps that you saw in the images. And he entered a historic maelstrom. William Anderson rented the house in the town of Highland as his family residence from 1897 to about 1904.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Anderson subsequently purchased the home in 1915 and lived there until his death in 1930. A well-respected lawyer known for his hat plug hat Anderson practices profession in Denver, the Denver Times newspaper reported. Mr. Anderson found himself granted the power of attorney by Alfred Packer, believing he could appeal his case on a technicality.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you don't know the Packers story, you could get information at a restaurant and grill on the CU Boulder campus. On that day, January day, Mr. Anderson would walk down those steps, bought the number 34 tram and traveled to downtown Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He would go to discuss the Packer issue with the reviled Denver Post publishers Harry Taman and Frederick Bonfils. These publishers were known for defaming their enemies at business rivals in their paper. Upon Mr. Anderson's arrival, an altercation arose.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Reportedly, Mr. Bonfils struck Mr. Anderson across the face. As you've heard, Mr. Anderson shot. Both men enact that a Denver jury ultimately after three trials determined was an act of self-defense. Headline News raced across the country for the ensuing three years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Anderson, in the story, remained in the national news. A yellow journalistic campaign by the Denver Post attacked Mr. Anderson in its pages. Competitors to the Denver Post also provided significant coverage. This competing coverage would report complaints from the jurors of the first Anderson trial that the Post publishers working with court officials had attempted jury bribery.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In November 1901, a Denver jury acquitted Mr. Anderson of all charges. A grand jury completed their investigation into the jury bribery in April 1903. Two weeks later, April 25th, 1903, just before the start of their criminal trials, Mr. Tillman, the court officials pleaded guilty to the jury bribery charges reportedly to protect unnamed others who had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Lloyd. Mrs.. Mr. Lloyd, I apologize your 3 minutes ago. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next, scott. Morning.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. My name is Scott More. I reside at 4175 South Acoma Street in Inglewood, Colorado. I'm an architect. And a general contractor. I have no connection with any of the parties involved here. The reason I'm here is because my blood boils when I read about these historic designations in the newspaper.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A colleague brought this one to my attention. I took the opportunity to do something about it. I'm the kind of person that will call the police if I see a mugging. Taking place, and that is my motivation for being here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I've had the pleasure of sitting on a building department board of Appeals as a historic preservationist. And I'm here to tell you that although this house is nice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is not nice enough to merit the taking of someone's pension, which is essentially what's happening here. Vernacular is, by.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Definition, ordinary.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This house was ordinary. It is ordinary. It is not in the best interest of historic preservation to have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The important work of historic Denver co-opted and used.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To circumvent the city's master planning process to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Block development.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I am speaking against designation of this property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Moore. Kerry Mock. Ms.. MOCK And you have 6 minutes. And while she's come to speak, we're going to call the next five names. You can make your way up to the front pew. Gerard Seidenberg. Marie Benedict.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Elizabeth Rogers. Marie Edgar. And Andre Kilian. So you five can make your way up this month. You may begin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Members of council. I'm glad to be here. My name is Corey Ellen Mock. I live at 2101 Clay Street and I am an architect. That's three for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Three. So we're on a roll.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here, I guess. I support this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I support this landmark designation, and I have no financial interest in the outcome of this hearing. I believe the architecture of the Andersen House is significant, as you've already heard from the Landmark Preservation Commission. This building is structurally sound and is an excellent example of middle class, dare I say, vernacular or usual.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Queen Anne style home popular in Denver between the 1870s and 1890s. There's a lot of history that's happened in ordinary buildings, and so I'd caution us from using that as a reason not to think of this as a special place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Originally prominent in the early town of Highland. This building remains a unique landmark in the Jefferson Park neighborhood, built in 1888, the home rises from a Rusticated Stone Foundation and includes a well-executed masonry detailing that goes all the way around the front.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Gabled roof accentuates the asymmetrical facade with a prominent front porch and decorative trim highlighted with contrasting colors. Brick detailing emphasizes the arched front window that you saw in the photographs earlier and extends around the South Side, which also features decorative elements on the dormer bay, window, side, entrance and chimneys.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I only wish so much of our architecture today. Even buildings I work on could afford that kind of detail. When I compare the House of today with the 40 year old photograph I see and Ruth Weinberg's book, Rediscovering Northwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The level of architectural integrity that remains is truly remarkable. Beyond simply exhibiting the characteristic queen in form and fenestration, this house has retained character defining features that are usually lost by now. Well, you can find more elaborate homes of this style elsewhere in Denver, there are precious few remaining in this neighborhood and none with this colorful history'",

I offered to do walking tours, and so I was looking through history books and I found one house in the middle of Jefferson Park, just one house with any sort of historical story written'",
        "'speaker_7': 'about it. And it was this one house. So we can talk about photographs of other houses in the neighborhood. That may also be pretty, but it doesn't have the historical significance that this one house does. So the existence of other structures in the city do not diminish this home's clear architectural significance, nor would they necessarily be eligible'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for designation under Denver's strict landmark preservation guidelines. This home, once considered the tall house on a tall hill, has the architecture, the history, and even the geographic location to earn it a historic designation.

        "'speaker_7': 'don't be bully bullied into a false choice. You can create a win win here for our community and for the homeowner. I asked you to take the long view for the community and grant designation tonight. Thank you for your consideration and for your service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Miss Bond. Next, we have Jared Seidenberg.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Members of council. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity. My name is Gerard Seidenberg. My address is 6825 East Tennessee Avenue, Suite 5525. I'm a business owner within the city and I'm a property owner, Branson's Lake. I'm here tonight to speak in opposition of this historic designation in a hostile manner, as was noted by the LPC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is an interesting story and I've been following along as a lawyer who does not represent any parties here and has no other interest in this matter. I'm deeply concerned with the ramifications of approving this hostile designation and the direct effect on our property rights.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, I'm not here tonight to talk about this topic tonight. I'm here to address something that's near and dear to my heart. You see, my family has lived in and around Denver for six generations, beginning when we settled around Sloan's Lake in the 1800s.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In many ways, my history is inextricably intertwined. Excuse me with that of the Queen City. Whether I walk the streets of downtown around the highlands, where my wife and I buy our first home, our collective history is everywhere, and every house has a story to tell.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In that way, our history is alive as it is now. I'm often supportive of historic designations and usually in favor of protecting our valuable history. But in this case, I just cannot. The history reported here is weakly tied to events that impacted society in the homes place, and that history is bootstrapped by time and space in a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'way that cannot qualify it for historic preservation, especially in a hostile manner such as this. We're not talking about Molly Brown or McNichols or Speer. We're not talking about a house where historical events took place. As the LPC chair suggested, this is a stretch and he was right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This property has no direct or substantial influence on society. And while the story of Mr. Anderson is admittedly interesting, he himself failed to have a direct or substantial influence on society in any positive way. So what do we have here?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All we have is the Denver Post puts it is some mighty thin gruel. It is clear that Mr. Anderson lived in Denver at one point, renting 23, 29 Eliot, and then later purchasing the property. He was not the original owner and he was not the builder of the structure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's clear that he was an attorney. It is purported, but unsupported, that Mr. Anderson sought to undertake the representation of Alfred Parker. But his legal career is otherwise unremarkable and his relationship with Packers tenuous at best. Contrary to the narrative of the Hustle application, Mr. Anderson didn't take any remarkable cases, championed any contemporary causes or influence society'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in which he engaged. He didn't seem to even move the needle as a lawyer, and I found no one in the community that knows of his story. For Mr. Anderson's most notable moment. It is suggested that a disagreement over his suggested appeal strategy for the defense of Parker between himself and the publishers Denver Post, Bonfils and TEMIN'",
        "'speaker_4': 'led to a disagreement so fierce that he brandished his concealed weapon and shot both men in their office and Denver Post. Let me repeat that. His most notable moment is that he shot but failed to kill. Publishers of the Denver Post in their office over a disagreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For this act, Mr. Anderson was tried three times for his alleged crime, but never convicted. Now I find these actions and I find nothing in these actions at a substantial or direct effect on society at all. Fact is that even if one was to concede that Mr. Anderson tried to represent Alfred Parker, and even if you can'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see that the subsequent trial was garnered by national headlines and sensationalist, there's nothing historical about 2329, Eliot, in a way that's contemplated by the hostile assault designation. No actual history of significance occurred within its walls. It merely serves as a thin, tangential tie to a nefarious history of a man who lived in Denver and acted as a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'loose cannon, who took a pistol to an argument, lost control of his emotions, and turned to violent violence to solve these problems. Approving the designation does not, which does not have any merit to the premises, and requiring the visitation of the preservation of the structure does nothing to preserve Denver history and does nothing to promote the sense'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of community. Because, as I remind you, nothing of historical significance happened at 2329, Eliot. History is important. It tells us who we were and it sets the bar for who we want to be. So I ask you, is this the history that we wish to protect?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That of a violent shooter, a marginal lawyer? What is the measure of a human being that requires us to forcibly protect the place where he, he or she slept? How low is the bar? To become so notorious that merely living in a structure makes it a part of history.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are the questions that we must ask ourselves, because that is exactly what you're being asked to do. Protect the place that a man slept because he was involved in a sensational shooting, notorious in its time and nothing more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are a community. That knows too well what affect gun violence has. We're all too familiar with the ramifications of lone wolf gunman. So I suggest to you to review these events surrounding Mr. Anderson through a modern lens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think about how his story sounds in the context of the events that have unfolded in our own communities. And think about the message we would be sending to our children. Fame and notoriety. The kind of which that leads to the preservation of your home long after your death, should not come from a violent act, but from positive'",
        "'speaker_4': ', direct and substantial effects on our community. The type that our community leaders often have landmark designation, hostile or otherwise, should serve to protect iconic structures and people. Hostile designation should be used only in the most extreme cases where failing to do so would deprive us all of a historical roadmap.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Should send the right message about who we are, and it should be a proud example of who we want our children to be. Not to perpetuate a myth of gun violence in the West. Unfortunately, here we do not have such an event or structure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for these reasons I ask that you do not approve the hostile landmark designation before you tonight. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Mr. Steinberg and I failed to mention you did have 6 minutes. Thank you. Next, Marie Benedict.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. My name is Marie Benedict and I live at 3284 Osceola Street. I have no financial connection to this house. If this were a normal landmark hearing, we would simply stop with the history and petition signatures. However, the issue of property rights has been raised and as has the specter of anti-development and loss of financial well-being'",
        "'speaker_7': '. To try to characterize our effort to preserve the House, the applicants and those who have supported this designation are like most Coloradans and Westerners in our deep rooted belief in property rights. However, we are aware that we live in a city where.'",

Yeah, the landmark provision is no different than any other zoning mechanism that is used by the city to shape the character of our town.

        "'speaker_5': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Several years before us, it was a risk that Jim took on. We invested ourselves personally and financially in that area. Our house was one of the ugliest houses on the block. We took our very, very limited money that we had in our early twenties to improve our personal property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the amazing thing is, as we did that, we looked around on our block and the other owners started to take notice of the condition of their properties.

        "'speaker_1': 'Rogers. Apologize. Guthrie. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we have Marie Eggert.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Marie. Edgar and I have lived at 35, 32 West 39th Avenue since 1986. Like the owner of this property, I want my standing as a Northwest Denver property owner to be respected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have no financial connection to the property owners house. I am commenting on the news, the recent news that the property owner has been offered more than $1 million for his property. A story was created in the press that with designation of Mr. Sun like News House, he would see the value of his property reduced to 600'",
        "'speaker_5': 'or $700,000. The applicants for designation have argued that this story is a fiction. Yet it has still captured the attention of many. I now understand the reality to be that the applicants have heard from interested developers who would be willing to purchase the property for the same or above the stated offer of $1 million.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A developer on Friday offered the owner $100,000 above the million dollar offer. This was a real offer. He would develop the property around this house and he would restore the historic Anderson house. The owner did not sign the agreement, preferring to wait until after this hearing to discuss offers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He and his broker have seen the offer and have even made modifications amenable to Mr. Sun Leitner. These recent events make it clear to me that the owner of this property will not be harmed by this designation. His retirement does not hang in the balance at this hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This excellent opportunity, along with historic designation of the Andersen House, creates a win for the owner. A win for a developer and a win for Jefferson Park and the city of Denver. I respectfully ask that you honor the public's interest in designating this House as an historic landmark, allowing many differences and hostilities to be resolved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Your decision to landmark would be in line with the city of Denver's goal of preserving the valued identities and characters of our neighborhoods. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Begin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, counsel. My name is Andre Kirby on 2202 Iris Street, Lakewood, Colorado. I have successfully taken five different projects through the Landmark Preservation Commission process, and I definitely have a respect and understanding for what the LPC aims to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you heard earlier, the meeting, the Landmark Preservation Commission hearing on this was three and a half hours. And on the one hand, I was really very proud to see two pretty heated sides discussing in a civil discourse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was it was I was very proud to see. But on the other hand, that three and a half hours pushed other projects and other deserving landmark preservation cases further down and eventually off of the agenda. There are three things that I want to share with you today, largely procedural, that I wanted you to know as you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'consider this case. The first one is that this this designation was originally filed specifically to stop development by Nick Garcia. He'll hear from later. It was filed to stop development. The second thing that I want you to know is that the city of Denver already has two directives related to development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first one is the 2000 blueprint, Denver, which and this is a direct quote, the planning process for Blueprint Denver resulted in a new vision for Denver in 2020, organized organized around the plan's central premise that growth should be directed to areas of change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in Blueprint, Denver Jefferson Park is specifically designated as an area of change. The second is the Denver zoning code from 2010. This is a direct quote from the intent section of the code. This code is designed to provide standards for compatible transitions of use density, building scale and height between existing and new development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Denver Zoning Code states that this property is zoned as Jim three, which allows for a very specific amount of density and height. The code also says this The code is designed to provide clear and consistent procedures for appropriate and effective public involvement in land use and development decisions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Section 12 .3.4 of the Denver Zoning Code clearly directs this public involvement to the planning board, not to the Landmark Preservation Commission. And that leads me to the final thing that I want you that I want to present to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you allow historic circumstantial designation to be used as a weapon to fight development, you will see more and more of these cases in front of you every Monday night. And they will continue to clog up the agendas of the Landmark Preservation Commission, preventing them from ruling on things that I feel are far more important than this'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And you'll be ruling what I feel like is in direct conflict with two of the developers, two of the directives that the city has already put in place to govern development. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Jerry Olson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Good evening. My name is Jerry Olson and I live at 2195 Decatur Street, one block away from 2329 Elliott Street, the Anderson House. I'm an applicant for the landmark designation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the past eight years, I've been active in the Jefferson Park United Neighbors Organization, Japon, and I am a board member. First, I would like to say that we in Jefferson Park embrace sound development. And because of our proximity to downtown, we know development is coming.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many homes have been scraped to make way for multi-unit housing, but very few homes are like the Anderson House, which merits landmark designation in the redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of Jefferson Park. We have worked very successfully with developers like Silk Law Development and Allied Realty.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They communicate very well and they work with us, not against us. And while we have remained.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Positive in our in our endeavor, unfortunately, the developer in this case has not done so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Instead, he has blocked community voice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He has. Done. He has colluded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To pull the original application for landmark designation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At the 11th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hour, he has sued the city and lost, I might say. And he has been pushing the owner into the media, his poor gym.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By attempting to intimidate an applicant, also by attempting to intimidate an.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Applicant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Designation through their employer. Employer. By forcing a j pun vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In a manner that has forced the R.A. Board to change its bylaws by shutting also by shutting down all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Attempts by applicants to even sit down with the owner and discuss the issue. While we respect the owners decision to sell to whomever he wishes time and time again, we have not heard from the owner. But instead the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Buyer, his PR firm, his lawyers and other developers connected with the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While we expect to hear from him today, please know that the community, which is looking to preserve this home, has always been committed to ensuring that the owner will not be harmed financially. In closing, I would like to say that we in District one have been disenfranchized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Olson, I apologize. You 3 minutes is up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Too bad. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Jim Potter. Jim Palmer. Jim Palmer. That's okay, Betty. Lou saying and you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Betty Luce. I live at 2660 mead in Denver, which is about a mile from the Andersen house. I've lived in the neighborhood since 1990. I'm a senior broker associate with nostalgic homes, and I've been employed there since 2000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am speaking in favor of landmark status for the property at 2329 Elliot Street. Last week I presented a backup offer to purchase the property on behalf of one of my longtime clients. This offer was was presented to Michael Ayre, who told me that he has a listing agreement with Jim to sell his property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I've communicated with him several times and the offer was in fact emailed to him. My client has offered $1,100,000 for the property with no contingency related to historic designation of the House. It is his intention to restore the Anderson House and to develop the property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He has investigated the zoning and the building code for the site quite thoroughly and is satisfied that he could build an adequate number of attached dwelling units on the property to justify the purchase price of 1,100,000. In other words, if the landmark status is awarded to the Anderson House and if the owner would eventually accept my client's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'offer, his proceeds from the sale would be greater than he would net under his current contract. And as we say in real estate, there is nothing better than a back up offer. My client's career in Denver dates back to the seventies when he developed large commercial projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Later, he created many for sale townhome developments in the metro area. The most recent being Lowell Rowe at 73rd and Lowell near the new light rail station that is going on up there. He has made a name for himself in the North Denver neighborhood in these past few years by renovating and expanding vintage homes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He hires the best architects. His houses are beautiful. They complement the context of the neighborhood. In fact, he and his wife moved into one of their own renovations in North Denver several years ago. And speaking as his realtor, I can tell you that his projects are in very high demand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They sell immediately, some of them even before they're finished. In my years as a realtor in that neighborhood, I have listed and sold many vintage homes and including two of the three houses in the neighborhood that I refer to as our signature houses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These imposing Victorians are part of our neighborhood identity. All have gone through periods of serious decrepitude. They've been faced with demolition, with people who wanted to scrape them. And but fortunately, now through all three are beautifully restored and they're occupied by young families.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would tell you that the house at 32nd and Osceola, for those of you who know the neighborhood, was nearly scraped about eight years ago to make way for ten townhomes. It's hard to imagine our neighborhood without these houses, multiple townhomes standing on these corners instead of glorious houses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not a pretty picture. The Anderson House is Jefferson Park's signature house. This is a more humble neighborhood and it's a more humble house. The house is high on the hill because the house looks pretty tired and rundown right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Many think it would be just okay to scrape it and make way for something new. But a superficial evaluation does not reveal the truth of this house. There are many recent photos, the recent photos of the exterior. It is built on a three foot deep stone foundation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is a bit of minor cracking near a window on the south wall, but for the most part, the house stands tall and drew. The 22 Redstone steps leading to the entrance are perfectly straight. The idea that this house is a wreck is ridiculous to me, to be quite honest.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can assure you that it would be a very expensive proposition to demolish this house. And I can also assure you that the neighbors would be devastated to have to watch it happen. Now I'm a senior citizen, as well as Mr. Sonn Lightner and I also live in an old house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm well aware of the daunting challenges of maintenance, particularly deferred maintenance. It faces us after we've lived in our houses for a long time. And the idea that he would lose 400,000 from the purchase price offered by the buyer if his house is designated?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, that is a frightening thought to any retiree. There is no doubt that Mr. Snyder is ready to be gone from his house, but his house does not need to be gone from the neighborhood. We have a qualified buyer who has made a higher offer and a better proposition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can assure you that when my client is finished with the property, it will shine with distinction, will be a source of pride and part of the charm of the neighborhood for many years to come. If we let go of our historic houses without a protest, the coming generations will have no idea of the proud history of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver. This is a western city and a relatively young city. We have precious few of these great old houses and we need to try a little harder to preserve them. I'm asking you as council members to take a vote to preserve our heritage and to grant landmark status to the Andreassen House at 2329.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Elliott. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Matthew Rock. Do not have a matthew Rock. Okay. Nick Garcia. And as Mr. Garcia comes up, I'll call the next five. Mike Ayer, John Olsen, David Bertran, Andy Levinsky, and Dan Rogers. So you five can make your way up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Mr. Garcia, you may begin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Nick Garcia. I'm here to say that I opposed the historic designation of this property. I owned the property at 2324 Federal Boulevard, and I provide affordable housing for the neighborhood, which is very hard to find right now and very hard to maintain.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This historical designation will not only make things very rough for Jim in his future, it's also going to really affect my business and the families that live at my units. I have a four unit building, all three units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's family that families that lived there several years ago when they widened federal, they took out all my parking on the street. I only have four spaces private, one for each unit, three bedroom units. So if the husband has a car and the wife needs a car to have a kids, she's out of luck.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If if I go and I have to meet with my tenants for something, I'm out of luck. If the handyman has to go fix something, he's out of luck. Well, Jim was nice enough during this time to let me park in his in his yard and in his back lot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also, we began to park in what was then the alley, but now belongs to Jim. So that that really saved my business. I originally did oppose this, this, this whole situation, and I was for the designation to stop parking, just as the gentleman before me said.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I was I was originally for this designation. Thankfully, that really thankfully Nathan Adams reached out to me and he says, Nick, listen, you need parking. I think I can help you. That was a blessing for me to hear that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was a blessing for my tenants to hear that, you know, which people seem to care very little about. Anyway, Nathan and I did make a deal and he did agree to. He changed his whole plans. I was floored me to help me with my parking, to accommodate me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was it was really impressive. He did do that and I'm very grateful to him. So bottom line is, if this goes through, it's certainly going to it's really going to hurt my business. It's going to hurt Jim.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's going to make it difficult for me to to to operate. And I am against this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mike Ire.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Mike Air, and I'm opposing this designation. I'm Jim, Jim's listing agent, and I've been with Jim since the beginning of the sales transaction. I've been selling and developing real estate for more than ten years in the Denver area, as well as into the mountains.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Currently, I'm working on another project in the Sloan's Lake area with 24 units, so I'm very familiar with the property values in the area. I evaluate, evaluate each of Jim's properties and looked at the development potential when deciding to proceed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We felt there was probably a little more value in the land at the time of the contract. More than 15 months ago, when looking at the comparables but felt there was a lot of hurdles to go to get over to get the deal done, we felt that Adams development had the neighborhood experience to get the job done'",
        "'speaker_4': '. We felt very good about them having the capital, the layout, to get to the finish line and get Jim paid so he could retire. I want to clear up a couple items as far as a back up offer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did receive a backup offer. The offer had a number of contingencies, not one regarding the historic designation, but a number of other contingent contingencies. The proposed buyer is interested in doing 10 to 12 units is, which is what he told me on the phone when we discussed it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My understanding with the current zoning code for GMU three is that you require 50 feet of frontage to develop more than a duplex on the property. So by making the property historic, it would take it from being anywhere from 12 to 18 units on a property down to a duplex with possibly a carriage house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then for this prospective buyer to come in and restore the Victorian home. So I'm not sure where everyone's going with as far as they have, this bona fide $1.1 million offer. Because I heard the guy loud and clear and he said, You want to do 10 to 12 units?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I said, Are you willing to proceed and move forward with the contract based on a duplex and restoring a Victorian home? Then he said it didn't make sense. Then I suggested that he contact the zoning department to reaffirm that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have as well spoke with Doug Jones of the development services at the City of Denver and confirmed this requirement. Now, I just want to make sure when you guys come to your decision that you don't let this backup offer muddy the water.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'a neighbor called us and asked for help researching the home's history in response to the Certificate of Non Historic Application. As a nonprofit advocacy organization, we strive to be a resource and because we felt that this home deserved further conversation, we provided that assistance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When that original neighbor withdrew their application for designation, we shared the content we developed with us, with the applicants here today, and they have since expanded on that content. Again, we did this because we think our historic resources add important value to our neighborhoods and our city and deserve thoughtful conversation and full consideration.'",

And I believe this would reduce the property value. I implore you not to support this historic designation and don't promulgate the acknowledgment of an alleged shooter in it as a historic location.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I respectfully request that you deny this council Bill.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Council took this step to prevent surprise demolitions during our last boom cycle. It is not dissimilar to some two. It is not dissimilar to ordinances in other cities of our size, although our designation criteria actually set a higher bar than many of our peer cities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The ordinance is intended to give the community time to react to potential demolitions and to seek solutions that are in the best interests of owners, neighbors and the city at large. The ordinance has worked well in this way in several instances, with conversations leading not to this room, but to positive outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is historic Denver's policy to pursue creative solutions. And I believe because of that, council has been in your shoes only a few times in nearly ten years. So while we are here tonight talking about one specific property, I thought you should know about dozens of other properties and historic resources already lost this year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As one of the first speakers noted, there have been nearly 600 demolitions reviewed this year and only 34 properties were posted as potentially eligible for historic designation of all of those properties. There's only one this designation this evening and one other anticipated by the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This means you are being asked to consider saving only point 3% of all the buildings we are losing this year, a record year. Some of those other losses that did not come in front of you include commercial properties designed by architects, historic cottages and five points in the Five Points neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The entire historic hardware block in River North and several fine had homes in hilltop. I bring this to your attention to demonstrate that this property clearly carries significant value, historical importance and community support to have reached this step in a process that requires a great deal of energy from the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If there had been an opportunity to have a meaningful dialog with the current owner or the owners representative, we would have happily facilitated those conversations as we have in the past because we do believe this property represents a very real opportunity for a win win outcome due to its size, common ownership with neighboring properties and the alley'",
        "'speaker_7': 'vacated by council earlier this year. Unfortunately, our invitations to meet with the owner and the developer to discuss creative ways to develop the site while retaining the house even without historic designation, were not accepted. The sheer volume of demolition taking place in our city this year means that we have to have hard conversations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are all those places worth saving? None of them. Or some of them, as you're being asked to do tonight at historic Denver, it is our job to take the long view. What will our city look like, feel like and live like?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not just next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now or 50 years from now? What will we still have? A unique identity. We hope so. But we need to consider our historic places. And I thank you for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Miss Lipinski. Next, we have Dan Rodgers. And as Mr. Rodgers comes up, I'm going to call up the next five names who all have 6 minutes Diane Irvin, Justin Archuleta, Brad Evans, Nathan Adams and Jude Aiello.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you five can make your way up to Rodgers. You may begin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name's Dan Rodgers. I'd like to also speak to the contract that's proposed on the table. I'm from the commercial job site. Superintendent is my background and I've done some historic renovation stuff to look at of Heights Catholic Girls School that the Salvation Army currently owns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been hands on on a lot of these jobs and have the experience and care very deeply about the work. The whole that the the contract that's on the table has a lot of holes that could get poked in it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jim shook Nathan's hand. I met Nathan for the first time tonight over 13, 14 months ago. Jim's been wanting to retire since that day. He was looking at nine months ago that he could retire. He was on the roof today, finishing up a roof hump and bundles on a steep pitch.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He's 63, almost 64 years old. He needs to get off that roof. No more messing around. He's got he shook Nathan's hand. That's the deal. That's the kind of of of person that Jim's son Leitner is. There's contracts and paperwork.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Call it the Anderson House, the name on the shirts and. Correct. Jim's an old renowned motorcycle road racer. Got my wife and I into it. Him getting us into that sport actually got my wife a college scholarship for road racing motorcycles and helped us with our education.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a lot of not world renowned but widely known racetrack here in Colorado called Second Creek Raceway. And there's a pretty difficult corner in that particular racetrack that Jim had the opportunity to crash not only his primary race bike, but his back up race bike in the same day and was complaining to the track.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Guys, how about what a rat's nest this thing was, right? So from that day forward, Jim became rat and that became the rat's nest across the country that when he'd have the Christmas party for the Motorcycle Road Racing Association and all of our families would come up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was that rat mansion. That's the name of the house. That's what thousands of people in Denver know it as his rat mansion. We need to get this deal, move forward. He needs to retire. That's it. No more messing around that for that million.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One has tons of holes in it. All it's going to do is keep him from retiring. So that's it. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Rogers. Diane Irvin. And you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I support the designation and I have no financial interest in this hearing. My focus is our shared interest in economic development in this city and how historic preservation supports it. Businesses in Jefferson Park Town Square support this designation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Owners of both the Jefferson Park Pub and 2914 Coffee have signed to support it out of a commitment to the community, but also because they understand that historic preservation and compatible new development attract paying customers. Give the story of hot tempers and the three year national scandal around the likes of William Anderson and the Denver Post owners'",

And entrepreneurs from Union Station to coffee shops around the city will sell t shirts and yellow Denver Times newspaper headlines about the shooting to tourists from California to New York, the Andersen House.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'History is the entrepreneur's opportunity to generate revenue for their family businesses and for the city. The National Trust for Historic Preservation and United States Department of Housing and Urban Development at the national, state and local levels see historic preservation as vital to urban revitalization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Judith Kremen, executive director of the Baltimore County Historical Trust, lauds the benefits of preservation to local economies. Historic preservation creates jobs, which increase revenue for suppliers and service providers alike. It is an ideal economic development strategy for attracting entrepreneurs and retaining taxpaying, job producing small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It targets blight and neglected properties for improvement. It encourages private investment by visually demonstrating public investment in an area. Denver's Landmark Preservation Commission adds to the list of economic benefits of reserve preservation. It enriches residents and business owners alike by visually representing that we value continuity and connection to places.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Historic districts support neighborhood stability, which contribute to long term neighborhood viability. Historic preservation stimulates government revenue. Building permits from. 2010 to 2012 show that construction investment is 3 to 10 times greater in historic districts than in other areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A 2011 study by Clarion Associates reports that for every $1 million spent on historic preservation, 32 jobs are generated. Those 32 jobs have paychecks. They pay taxes and they support even more jobs in the community. Garrison Keillor on NPR just this past week broadcast from Cleveland.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He was extolling the exciting, historic preservation of Cleveland that had to be worth millions to Cleveland. Historic preservation is synonymous with economic development. We learned that with Larimer Square is the redevelopment. Let us build on that wise decision and do more of what we have already proven we can do so well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My company brings money into Denver from across the nation and 30 countries like you. I'm committed to economic development of the city. Let us build on what we have done well and bring more money to Denver from across the nation in good conscience.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, Justin Archuleta. And you have 6 minutes as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Justin on your letter. I am a homeowner in District one. Address 1599 West Berkeley Place and I am currently under contract to purchase my own home in Jefferson Park, though I'm not a resident quite yet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I consider myself a part of the neighborhood community. I've worked with local organizations and a volunteer capacity. I've studied the neighborhood plan in great detail. I've attended numerous neighborhood organization meetings, and unfortunately, I likely buy much more coffee and food from local area businesses than many residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also work for Adams Development, the small Jefferson Park based business involved in this transaction. My role with Adams is primarily that of development project management. I'm here today to speak about an issue that has come up in conversations regarding Jim's house that of Right of way vacations, commonly known as alley vacations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've heard about it tonight and we heard it about it also at the Landmark Preservation Commission. To be clear, the issue of right of way vacations has no place in the debate regarding the merits of whether Jim's home is historic or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It simply is unconnected, and there's no relationship between the two. There is a place for discussion of right of way vacations in a larger context about development. And I believe it's become quite clear that the debate about 23, 29 Eliot Street has transcended historic designation at this point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This property and the debate surrounding it has become an outlet for a portion of the community to voice concerns about development in general. It is to those concerns that I would like to speak. Comments were made by Dennis Gallagher at the Landmark Preservation Commission hearing that the city is choosing to give land away to profit driven developers'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and receiving absolutely nothing in return. That is simply not true. The city actually maintains a policy statement on street and alley vacations that I think many, including Mr. Gallagher, may be unaware of. I'd like to go over some of the information contained in that policy statement with you now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First to address comments that the city should have sold the land to gym and gotten financial compensation. Those pushing for this are likely unaware that there is actually a state law prohibiting the city from selling dedicated right of way upon vacation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's outlined in the city's policy statement. Now, that doesn't mean that the city is simply giving land away without thought or without a policy for protecting the public's interest. Vacations go through a lengthy process of review at the Department of Public Works.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alli vacations are only approved if the applicant accommodates the needs of transportation, storm, sanitary utility and other needs. To quote from the city's policy statement, the applicant must understand that the service level of the remaining right of way must be maintained or improve the existing condition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On page 11, in the packet that was distributed to you. Is a photo taken of the land that was vacated? That land was not serving any public interest and has been a dumping ground that attracts waste that Jim has become responsible for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because for the city, the city has not been maintaining that right of way. That right of way was a pretty small portion of land that divided the property that Jim owned in the front of the lot from the carriage lot that he owned in the rear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no other party that could have benefited from that land. It was unpaved and a redundant alley within the block. On page 12, you can see a diagram of the extremely valuable benefits intended as a result of that Ali vacation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city balances the vacation of land with the requirements of developers that developers actually dedicate or give back land to the city. Though I'm unaware of any state statute prohibiting the city from paying for that land, the reality is that developers are required to dedicate that land back to the city for nothing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, not just for nothing. Because developers are also required to spend considerable amounts of money to improve the land that city owns tied to receiving construction permit approval. In the case of 2329 Elliott Street, after considerable time effort of working with the city and the city's requirements for development of that property, we have received what the requirements'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for development will be from the Department of Public Works. Those requirements are that any development on the property would require that 900 square feet be granted back to the city and no cost. In addition, and the reason for that would be to widen those alleys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those alleys are all at ten feet. They're recognized by the neighborhood as kind of being dangerous because there's steep slopes. So there's people that won't even use the alleys in the winter for fear of sliding down into pedestrians.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those alleys would be required to be widened. That land given back, as well as all of the alleys surrounding the entire property, would have to be repaved. The cost of that paving is going to be over $100,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That work. The right of way permits, as well as just the concrete work involved, is not cheap. Now what that will do is benefit all the neighbors of the block, the community in general. I've heard from a member of the Parks Board of Denver that has recognized that the back of that alley as being a place that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'crime happens, people dump, trash, etc.. So the Department of Public Works is not giving in to greedy developers when it recommends that city council vacate land. The policies of the department actually result in huge benefit to the committee, the community, the city and neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bringing the issue of alley vacation into any conversation about whether or not to designate gems. Property is inappropriate and only meant to be a distraction to cloud this issue further. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next to Brad Evans. Evans, you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council members, thank you for allowing me to speak here today. My name is Brad Evans and I reside at 2835 West 24th Avenue, a stone's throw from this home that is up for a public hearing to council build.'",
        "'speaker_4': '1507 16. The historic designation that has been sought for this property is not being done by a rogue group of neighbors seeking to stop development. It's nor is it a band of outsiders trying to trample on an individual's property rights.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It has instead become a narrative about what Denver will become and what it was. Ultimately, the decision you are faced with today is whether or not we as a community have access to and can use already established sets of tools to retain a collective, collective connection to the past.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been part of the Jefferson Park United Neighbors since 2004, and Japan has been vigilant in its efforts to create a harmonious connection with the past and with its close proximity to downtown. It's also work to find win win solutions for the new development that's coming to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Over the past 12 months, numerous 1900 area homes have been raised on nearly every block of northwest Denver, and more are being slated to be demolished in the coming days. Japan has long supported development, and this house on Elliott is not just another poorly maintained property, long in need of tender loving care.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's also in the middle of what is considered the core residential of Jefferson Park. This is noted in the Jefferson Park plan, which was adopted by City Council in 2005. Blueprint Denver considers this to be an area of stability, and there are few.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are also those that believe that this is one of the few homes left in Jefferson Park that should be preserved. And even Article one of the Denver zoning code allows for a single zone lot to be part of a zone, a part of an assemblage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the argument that the 92 feet requirement can be is moot because it's the zoning code allows it. Yes, this home has a storied past, but is not the only reason to vote for its preservation. With a yes vote for this historic designation, this House will serve as a beacon to future generations about the Wild West characteristic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of Denver and those that resided here at the turn of the century. While I have no financial interest in this property, I do have a long held interest in Jefferson Park and the community that it serves. Having served on the board of Jay Pond and chaired the Land Use Committee in the past, I'm also an active participant'",

Since the sixties, there is a well-known lack of investment in Jefferson Park, and up until the early 2000s, it was a haven for drug dealers and gangs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jefferson Park has long been populated by cherished groups that include urban pioneers, pawn indigent Latino families, as well as historic residents that were born in the homes they will see that they still inhabit. And haven't the Javon Board has acted as a champion for development and reinvestment as a means to place more eyes on the street and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in an effort to combat the criminal activity that had become part of the day to day goings on of this urban core neighborhood. John was approached by the city of Denver in around 23 to participate in the redevelopment of the former district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One police department located at 22nd, Decatur and city leaders thought Jay Pons input on the RFP and so valued input from the community that they gave J.P. and one of the three votes on that RFP. The winner of that RFP was David Zucker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is what spurred the development. Jefferson Park. This is the project. It was 42 condos. A lot of them affordable in it. And this company is also still and. Developer, still a participant in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Their next project, which was on Clay Street, was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Literally designed on the neighborhood board's kitchen table. They brought their people in and we put pieces of paper over here and did vignettes and really worked on what that development would look like. That's the kind of participation Japan in this neighborhood has done in development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm here to lend my voice in support of this historic designation, not to stop development, but to ask you to allow the neighborhood the ability of self-determination, which in part gave birth to the current development free for all that's happening in my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Should you vote against this bill and allow this home to be torn down, not only will we be losing a link to our past, but we will be tearing down a part of our future. I appreciate your time and thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we have Nathan Adams. So you have 6 minutes as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Good evening, council members. Thank you for your time and for your public service. My name is Nathan Adams. My company, Adams Development, has been working with Jim for 14 months now to purchase the properties of 23, 29 and 23, 21, 23, 31 Eliot Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You decide very important matters. And tonight you are tasked with the decision as to whether or not to give 2329 Eliot Street landmark status against Jim's wishes. This case is not a theoretical rule change that will apply equally to all constituents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The decision made tonight will have a direct impact on a 40 year resident. 27 of those years living in the home we are discussing. In addition to the impact to Jim, there are ramifications for a small business, a business that I own.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I employ 14 people and indirectly employ another 30 to 50 people at any given time. Decisions of this magnitude should be absolutely certain. Designating a home against the owner's wishes should be an extraordinary circumstance. With this in mind, serious questions have been raised tonight about the merits for landmark status.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The architecture has been deemed the Denver vernacular of a Queen Inn. Simply put, the home is not monumental. It is rare to find a home that is not a vernacular of some style as to history. There is no direct way to tie the house to history without relying on second degree and tangential connections.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Additionally, the attempts to connect the House to Anderson's shooting the Post editors is a glorification of gun violence, violence that did not happen at the house. The criteria for designation is anything but definitive criteria. Cited for designation is a stretch and is in no way, shape or form an extraordinary circumstance worthy of landmark designation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The bar should be raised or at the very least, strictly enforced. Either way, we should not leave here tonight with 2329 Eliot Street being designated a landmark building. The issue being brought by applicants is a small part of a larger discussion around Denver's growth and change spot zoning via hostile designation is not the right approach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Significant time, taxpayer money, financial burden on small business and economic harm to a homeowner have resulted for making the single property the focus of what should be a larger conversation. Resources utilized could have been spent supporting voluntary designation or voluntary historic districts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'River Drive in Jefferson Park, pictured on page 14 of the book that you have there. River Drive is an example of a place we should be looking at for voluntary designation. There are eight two storey Queen Anne's on one block alone, many of which are a better representation of a Queen Anne than 2329 Eliot Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This issue is not simply a developer against the neighborhood or a homeowner against a neighborhood. The neighborhood and city are divided on hostile designation. I personally support preservation when appropriate. I have restored a landmark building. I've renovated over 200 homes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've lived in the historic district of Potter Highlands. I've owned in the historic district of Potter Highlands and lived. I understand clearly that preservation is a worthy cause. However, I firmly believe that zoning this property with hostile designation against a homeowner's wishes is extreme.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Such extreme measures should only be used in the most extraordinary of circumstances. John Olson of Historic Denver told me that hostile designation serves a purpose. He cited Mt. Vernon. Mt. Vernon was saved by hostile designation. John and I can agree that on that end, extreme circumstances like saving Mt. Vernon hostile historic designation serves a purpose.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ladies and gentlemen, 2329. Eliot Street is no Mt. Vernon. Is a house that did not have a known story until a story was needed as a means to preserve, to stop or to alter development. Hostile designation sends a message to anti-development groups that utilizing the landmark ordinance as a tool to fight development is okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is becoming all too common. Trammell Crow recently experienced a threat on their 30th and little site and 5115 West 29th Avenue. They will be heard in council in two weeks. Hostel designation is not the correct forum for the conversation that needs to be had.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Preservationists should be. Preservation should be a civil discussion on a large neighborhood or landmark district scale for structures that don't stand on their own merits. Like the Molly Brown House does tonight, please say no to spot zoning. Protect Jim's property rights, defend small business, and preserve due process for our constituents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a show of support. We've submitted 98 letters and have collected over 500 signatures opposed to this designation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we have Julie Aiello. And as she would come forward, I'm going to call the next five names to speak, Jim songwriter Dennis Gallagher, Mr. Saca, Sophie, Billy, Zeke and Mary Hendrick. So you five can make your way up beside you may begin and you have 6 minutes to talk.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. My name is Judy along. I live at 909.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Lafayette Street in Denver. Although I was a 33 year resident of Northwest Denver, I'm a member of Denver Neighborhood Advocates, which supports preservation of neighborhood character. Please support designation of the Anderson House. As you well know, as council members, your job is almost always about deciding limits.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just like when council re zoned the entire city. Limiting, but not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Taking away what property owners could do. In this case, you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Are to limit what is to be considered and voted on to the preservation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rules. Does this meet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Two of the three criteria? If you personally think preservation isn't ever needed, or that by limiting what the owner can do to his property that you have somehow.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Taken away his rights. This should have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No place in the decision making process. Another Denver commitment. The 2020 sustainability goals also should be considered. It supports keeping buildings and reducing construction waste into city landfills.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You've already heard the statistics of the number.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of demolitions this year, a 20% increase over last year. Thousands of demolitions have been approved in the last few years. These applications and decisions required no public notice, meetings or votes. Interestingly, council seemed to have no problem with press, with trusting the City Preservation Department to decide if these.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hostile demolitions from the viewpoint.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of many neighbors who have to put up with them, meet the guidelines and can move forward. Yet when the Preservation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Determines a property does meet historic designation guidelines, a number of hearings and votes are mandatory, and the expert judgment of the Preservation Department is questioned. This four one half of 1% of the demolition applications.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The preservation preservation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Guidelines, support designation of structures which meet the strict Denver criteria. Even if the owner is not the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is not hostile. As a former councilman named them a term which is not used, thankfully, by the Preservation Department. The historical value of some buildings outweigh.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The wish of the temporary owner to maximize his financial gain. Ultimately, owners often find historic designation raises the value of the property, even though national and state historic designations in most states and cities require only one criteria out of three.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Denver requires at least two and often seems to expect three.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I personally think this meets all three, and despite this high.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Bar, the Preservation Department confirms the out Anderson House meets Denver's strict criteria. Council recently approved an ally vacation, without which the owner wouldn't have been able to access additional land and access for development. City Council's already given the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Owner this free gift. I'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Talk about what I call the Wal-Mart defense, which is my term, which describes owners claims that only.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One type of development is possibly possible or financially viable. This is a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'False and unsuccessful tactic that was used in the Highlands and a ninth and Colorado Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cases. It's on display by.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This owner and possible future developer in this case, as history and the non owners of these properties showed, there is more than one choice for a financially successful development in both the Highlands and ninth in Colorado Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Examples. The business is chosen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In place of the Wal-Marts. When. Not only much better fit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But wildly financially successful. I think it can be the same way with this property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to preserve history and places where.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Even tragic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And embarrassing events happened. Future generations shouldn't be shielded from the truth, even if that truth doesn't represent Denver Heights in the best light.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I trust that when you vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your decision is based on the city's criteria for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Approving the historic designation of this building criteria, which it clearly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Meets. If you find your personal objections.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or feelings prevent you from supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Designation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I request you do the honorable thing and refrain from voting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Miss Iowa. Next, Jim, sunlight through. And you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Hello. I'm Jim Sun Lightner. I suppose I'm the whole reason for this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Whole.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Ordeal. But basically, I've worked hard my whole life. My plan was the only thing I own out of it is my houses. My plan was to take my houses and use them as a retirement fund. Once I got to all the pound nails anymore and I've never been married, don't have a wife and kids.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The historic designation, I feel, is trampling my property rights. I feel I should be able to sell my house without having to go through a rigmarole. But I don't know that, you know, that is the way the system works is is not my problem.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I would I would urge the council to respectfully give me a no vote on this designation. Allow me to retire in peace and possibly build a little house with no stairs. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we had Dennis Gallagher. Who this is who I think it is. I don't see in the chambers. All right. Next, Mr. Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. My name is Chairman Sekou. Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Advocating for poor, working, poor homeless people. You know. But what we're faced with this evening is a conversation where we must put principle before personality. And I don't see any bad people in this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just see people doing what they feel they need to do with rationalization, justification. And on and on and on. We put the principle at the forefront. What we're really talking about is, are we going to be a city of me or are we going to be a city we see?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because in the we is our culture and our tradition that's bigger and greater than any individual in this room. Now, the spirit of Mr. Anderson is in this room. That's how significant this is, because he put principle before personality, because he had to go up against the power structure that was defaming and slander in his name.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And he's decided to take the personal responsibility to fix that, to defend his life, being attacked by people who were considered more powerful. Now, in this room, we have people who have come together as a community to say our culture, who we are, means more than the money.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm proud to be raised and born in Colorado. I love the wild, wild west. I've been to the East Coast, I've been to the West Coast. And the quality of the people are greater than all of that in this country because we believe in a fair fight and we believe in honesty, man.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I've heard a lot of stories up in there and there's a bunch of lies going on up in here. We're talking about a real estate deal that you got another deal on the table just in case this don't work.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That would get you more money and still give the people what they need in terms of their history and their culture. Now, come on, y'all. We got to sort through this thing and look at this rationally with who and what is being told is the truth.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the kids need this history. I wish there was some more Andersons around today that would stand up against those that are powerful and take the personal responsibility to take care of that and then weather the storm and take it to Judge Judy and take it to the people to see if I can if I'm right or'",
        "'speaker_12': 'wrong, because that's the way our country works. And what we have in this room is an outstanding, outstanding example of why this country is so great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is year in effect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Kind of every year, 3.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'You're going to give a 13.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Sophie and I apologize, Bill. Thank you, Europe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hello. My name is Sophie Blue and I live at 2822 Race Street in Denver. I'm a lifelong lover of history and I was intrigued when I read about the life of William W Anderson. The act for which Anderson is best known for his shooting about peace and famine is not a laudable act, and none of the applicants'",
        "'speaker_7': 'are arguing that. However, the story exemplifies many themes present throughout Carlyle's history and ties into an overarching, overarching mythos of the American West. At the turn of the 20th century, Denver in 1900 was a small town, small town stories.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These stories tell us something about ourselves and where we came from. They should also give us pause and make us think critically about where we are going as a community at its heart, Denver started as a town run by vigilante Justice Tillman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Bonfils often stoked this fire screaming headlines that got them to trouble more than once. The incident with William Anderson is a glimpse into the past, exemplifying many common themes from Colorado history that students learn about today in class, the role of vigilante justice in the early years of Denver, the rise of yellow journalism and widespread spread corruption'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in Gilded Age politics. William Anderson's Gilded Age sense of honor led him to confront Tammany Bonfils directly. Denver's history of Western style justice helps explain why he would have chosen this course of action. The rise of yellow journalism helps us to understand why Tillman and Bonfils were so caustic and bombastic in their careers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thankfully, we as a society have moved from these tactics, but just because we find them unsavory today doesn't mean that they didn't happen. Well, we should edit our history to center out the bad moments. We should ignore parts of our history that make us uncomfortable or which are inconvenient.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Another Denver landmark. That's an excellent example of how we as a community can talk about historical events without. Glamorizing them as the House of Mirrors at 1946 Market Street. It's a contributing building in the lower downtown historic district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It also happens to be one of Denver's most infamous landmarks, which was home to not one but two of Denver's most successful madams. The brothel status as the landmark does not mean that we as a community condone prostitution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Instead, we are acknowledging the social history of Denver and the reality many women in the West faced as they worked to create a new life. There's a world of difference between acknowledging and glamorizing the darker parts of history as an important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is important that we recognize the difference. Not only am I a lover of history and great stories like this, but I'm also a lover of education. I'm I work at Girls Inc of Metro Denver, which is about a mile and a half from the Anderson House.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I often drive around the neighborhood and it seems like there's a new development every month. I'm certainly not against development, but I think it's important for today's youth, like the girls that come to girls think especially neighborhood girls, to be able to see history around them and not just read about it in books.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I urge you to vote in favor of creating a local historic landmark Anderson House for future generations to appreciate. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we have Mary Hendrick. And as Mary comes up, I'm going to call the next five, David Zucker, Janice Stice, Trevor Greco, Rebecca Hunt and Amy Zimmer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. I'm here to ask you to support historic landmark designation for the Anderson House. You've heard the back story. I'm not going to reiterate that. But to save time, I just wanted to share that. I've lived here 43 years, raised a family, and I've lived in all parts of Denver, and I've made Highlands my home for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the last 20 years. We've basically seen many changes throughout the Denver metro area over the past 43 years, much of it welcomed and embraced. However, we are witnessing a level of development within our neighborhood that is unprecedented and the result of outside developers who see our neighborhoods as ripe for the picking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With Jim Sant Lightner, the owner of this victory and made it known. And again it's I'm reiterating what everybody knows here that he wants to retire and live out the proceeds of the sale of his home. I understand the first offer entertained by Jim was out of Adams development, who is hoping to be the only offer on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the table with what quote unquote appeared to be a generous offer of $1 million. However, Mr. Adams, owner of Adams development, recently purchased a much smaller home south of Jim's home for 1.6 million, which makes Jim's offer pale in comparison.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, Mr. Adams has said that Jim's home would only be worth 600,000 with a historical designation. What a bit of backpedaling going on here. Nothing could be further from the truth. And those who are familiar with historically designated homes know that such a designation garners far more money than not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a result, I am asking you to consider. Well, let me finish here. I'm sorry. I jumped ahead here and offered to top Mr. Adams bid by another developer was just presented, as we all heard, for 1.1 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as this story gains traction, it may be that other offers will be presented and considered by Jim, which would benefit him and in the process, preserve a gem of historical significance that has a place in Denver's history.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a result, I am asking you to consider granting this historical designation. Other districts in Denver are could conceivably be presented with a loss of historical status if such homes in those areas are considered commodities. For those developers who only whose only concern is to make as big of a profit margin as possible without regard for the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'home that is being scraped. Just to give some perspective, I had heard recently that approximately 4000 applications for scrapes were presented this past year throughout the whole of metro Denver, with only 41 applications for historical designations. And I just want to finish saying that the current owner will not be harmed, but on the contrary, will be in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a much better position to negotiate a higher price for his home if it is given this historical designation it's deserving of. Thank you for listening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Marin, could you say your name for the record? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mary Hendrick. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next, we have David Zucker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilmembers. My name is David Zucker. The developer has chosen to work closely with Jefferson Park neighbors. My office is two blocks away from this property on Decatur Street. I have no financial interest in the outcome of today's hearing, nor am I typically a fan of adverse historic designation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've always called Jefferson Park the non NIMBY neighborhood. My experience is that residents have been accepting of it, in fact anxious to see change and have always pushed to ensure that this change positively affects the community. When our first condo project got underway as a result of an RFP for the vacant district, one police station, gang activity'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and gunshots were rampant. Working closely with the Jefferson Park neighbors to put eyes on the park and our subsequent River Clay project designed in concept on a sound on a Saturday morning around the dining room table of the neighborhood president's home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These are still among my most gratifying, professional experiences. Increasingly, and with sadness, I sense that the care and forethought that this neighborhood brought to each proposed project through the neighborhood's Land Use Committee is being lost to a developer land grab.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The public, the great public realm, the historic homes, the modest, the walkability of Jefferson Park are at risk. But moreover, the community's cultural and economic diversity is being lost as this once affordable, historic single family homes are lost to redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Diversity has always been a hallmark of the neighborhood and a goal of the R.A., which formally published a dual language newsletter. Like other great historic urban neighborhoods like Highlands and Lower Downtown, the ability of the neighborhood to steward growth helps past current and future development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From my perspective and having spoken with neighbors and. Are no board members. There's a sense the neighborhood is under siege, that the stewardship of development, the Land Use Committee and the Arnaud itself are being overrun. As I understand it, the Arnaud board is currently working through bylaw changes to be protective of the residents voice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the Anderson home is designated historic, allowing the Arnaud to effect amendments to this would be protective. But losing the diversity of an architectural, significant mixed income community hangs in the balance. As a supporter and denizen of the neighborhood, I hope to see it thrive, ensuring that this neighborhood retains diversity in architectural history.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll end with the President. Words of the 25 neighborhood plan. On the first page, it states. Although the neighborhood generally welcomes new residents and businesses, it desires to protect and enhance the historic character of the diversity of its residents.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Over the years, Jim's told me stories about the bigger house in which he lives. In 1900, a lawyer named Anderson lived there while representing Colorado's most famous cannibal, Alfred Packard. Anderson shot two of its best known newspaper magnates, Harriet Harman and Frederick Bonfils.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Their newspaper, The Denver Post, survives as Denver's only Colorado leading newspaper. Well, I suspected Jim was pulling my leg. The story turns out to be true. Bonfils and TODMAN were renowned as extortionate scalawags and ink barrel blackmailers while they turned their attention to Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He fought back. Ultimately, the jury acquitted Anderson. Jurors may have been enchanted by Anderson's repeated excuse me, rapid police statement. And immediately after the shooting, boys arrest me. I just shot a couple of skunks. Today, a developer, Nathan Adams, has a property under contract with plans to build 18 townhomes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'While I look forward to meeting some new neighbors. I'm not keen on losing a historical touch stone with such a fine story to it. Fortunately, Jim says, some of other developers have figured out how to pay him just as much while retaining the Anderson House.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Adams has put in a lot of time and money in planning this development. I'd hate to see him lose his investment, but not as much as I'd hate to lose the Anderson House. I'm hoping the council votes yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Have Rebecca Hunt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, President Herndon and ladies and gentlemen of the City Council. I'm Professor Rebecca Hunt, a historian of Northwest Denver, just completing a book on the ethnic communities in this neighborhood. And I have lived at 2502 West 32nd Avenue for 22 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just finished four years as president of Highland United Neighbors. My only interest in this property is historical. I'm here to support saving the sterling example of our north side and of Denver's architecture. I'm also here because I know firsthand that preservation can pay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In 2014, I spearheaded a hostile designation of the Daniel Lucy House at the corner of 35th and Navajo Street. Daniel Lucy, by the way, was a ten year member of this esteemed body from 1990 to 1929. That designation never made it to this chamber because an enlightened developer, knowing what it meant to the neighborhood, chose to renovate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the house and now has it on the market for $1.2 million. That is independent of the money she's going to get for a malibu Modern and an 82 that are also on that property. She'll do okay. She was enlightened.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would have been so simple here if the developer had been as enlightened as the woman I dealt with. We know that there is another developer, at least one out there who's interested in this property. We know that Jim Sun Lightner will not lose.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He will still get his retirement nest egg. Preserving significant old houses is right for keeping Denver original and special. Preserving significant old houses is good business. I therefore ask you to approve the historic designation of 2329 Eliot Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is right for Northwest Denver. It's right for Jefferson Park. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the Denver City Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Miss Hunt. All right. Our last five speakers, Amy Zimmer and Leo Darnell. Charlene Tebow. Tebow, Joe Bowman and Pat Devore. And Amy Zimmer. You can begin your remarks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Good evening, council members. My name is Amy Zimmer. I am a member of the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission. The commission is made up of historians and architects who are qualified to determine the historic and architectural significance of potential landmark structures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Commission held a public hearing on October 6th, 2015. Hearing lasted nearly 4 hours and included testimony from approximately 35 individuals. The majority of those testifying in favor of designation were nearby neighbors whose own property would be directly impacted by this development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While those most of those testifying against the designation were more developers and business persons, many of whom who supplied addresses outside of the city and county of Denver. Further, the Landmark Preservation Commission questioned a petition submitted by the developer, Mr. Adams, which include mostly names from outside of Denver or even Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While the applicant submitted a petition with over 200 names of signatures from people who lived in Jefferson Park and the Highlands area, the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission is tasked with to turn, determining whether the property under review meets at least two of several criteria outlined under the categories of history, architecture and geography.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Commission found that the Anderson House did indeed meet two such criteria, including history Part C direct association with a person or persons who has had influence on society. This is clearly met by William Anderson's association with Bonfils and Tillman, owners of the Denver Post.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While Anderson's association with Alfred Packer may be negligible, his association with Bonfils and Hammon is indisputable. And those men, as owners of the newspaper, clearly had a direct influence on society. Landmark Commission also agreed that the Anderson House meets criterion under architectural significance, which is that it embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This home is an excellent example of the Queen Anne style, especially as it was adapted to Denver. The home also retains its historic integrity with numerous original architectural details. And I also want to point out that the packet that was passed out to you earlier this evening was also passed out to the Landmark Commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the examples cited by the developer of Queen Anne's in the neighborhood were actually determined by the commission not to in many cases, not to actually be quite Nance. Finally, although it was not specified in the application during deliberations, several commission members also noted that the House would have qualified for geographic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Significance for being prominently sited in a well-known structure in the neighborhood. We have heard a lot of prop about property rights this evening. So I ask you to please keep in mind the property rights of neighbors whose property will be directly affected by the act, by the development of the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And more importantly, I ask you to please vote in keeping with the recommendations of the historians and architects who make up the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission and designate the Anderson House as a landmark to preserve this link with Denver's colorful past in a neighborhood that is quickly losing all traces of its history.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Congress, Park, Ballpark, Rhino and now Highlands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Each neighborhood has a unique vibe and a distinct sense of place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think how different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Capitol Hill is from LoDo. Both are exceptional places. However, when you're in Capitol Hill, you know you're not in LoDo or Walsh Park. The buildings are different. The streets and the people are different. These neighborhoods were built at different times and often for different purposes.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Experiencing a boom in development. This is a great thing for our region for many reasons. For example, more people have jobs.

That being said, it appears that our haste to build more housing we are jeopardizing one thing that makes Denver a great city to live and work'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I believe this is destroying the sense of place as a distinct neighbor, as distinct neighborhoods that have long been inherent to Denver. I'm not anti-development or growth. I want to see neighborhoods embracing smart growth mixed with buildings that speak.'",

I understand the homeowner of Jefferson Park wants to sell to a developer who would move, remove that the historic home and build multifamily'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, members of council. I'm Charlene Tebo. I reside at 1475 Monaco Parkway. And I am here this evening to ask you to please support the designation of 2329 Elliot, known to all of you as the Anderson House, Mr. Sunlight and his house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to me it is known as Barbara and Fred's house. My sister and her husband purchased the home in 1974 when Jefferson Park was an extremely blighted area. The home was a boarding home, and we all we were just pretty dumbfounded that Barbara and Fred purchased this home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But when you got into the home, which I do have pictures of, that they restored, you could see the beautiful architecture behind these boarded up walls, the impeccable foundation of the home. It is it far surpasses anything that you will see in modern structures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The retaining wall that most of you have seen in some of the pictures, my sister and her husband never had to alter or repair that retaining wall. That in itself speaks to the foundation of the home. But more than anything, from 1974 until my sister's death in 1987, she lovingly, along with her husband, restored this home to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'its natural beauty. They did so without contractors. They did this of their own volition, not to ensure that the integrity was kept and which they did do. Barbara wanted to do. She wanted to have the home. She actually had applied for a historic designation, but because of her diagnosis of cancer, was not able to follow through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My former brother in law is the one that sold to Mr. John Lightner in 1989 when he remarried. If my sister was alive today, she would still be in the home. It would have its historic designation and we would not be in this lengthy proceeding this evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I ask you with all urgency, please, not in the memory of my sister, but what is right for our history to preserve this home. When Barbara was going to get the historic designation. I remember her telling me, she goes, Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you know that the the attorney for Alfred Packer owned this home? And I said, Wow, Barbara. I said, That's amazing. I said, Well, you know, C.U. has named their cafeteria after Alfred Packer. And she goes, Yeah, she said, So I'm going to seek historic designation for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to this is not this is nothing gruesome in our history. It's just history. Would we would we tear down the Ford Theater because Abraham Lincoln was shot there? No. And right down to in Philadelphia, there is an annual festival there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they have a tent. And this tent is entitled the Alfred Parker Memorial Dining Hall Serving Humanity since 1874. So this is far reaching, not in just the city of Denver or even the state of Colorado, but this is known nationwide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's also it has also I'm sorry, it gets a little motivational, but this has created the dialog citywide as well. I have a resident from Windsor Gardens, Linda Hargrave, who wrote a letter to council saying last summer I volunteered.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Again, I go back to 1974 and this was not the popular thing to do, but my sister saw what history meant and what it means to this city, and this is why we need to preserve this home. And in the testimony that I have heard, it sounds like there are many alternatives to preserving the home plus moving'",
        "'speaker_3': 'forward with development. I ask you, city council, please do designate not the Anderson house, but Barbara Fred's house as historic designation. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'The deal creates a sizable payment to the owner, allows for increased density for the city, revenue potential for a developer, and preserves the community's past and character. How this company chose to communicate it could have been part of the solution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was Anderson perfect? No. Did he take the law into his own hands? One columnist said. So is his story and his influence on individuals a power important to Denver? Yes. William W Anderson was well known in Denver before his run in with the publisher The Denver Post.'",

That is a story verifiable through any impartial historian you might put on the task.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I have come to some conclusions on the completion of this book, which was written in the mid-seventies. The first is obvious that Northwest Denver is a rare treasury of Victorian and turn of the century houses still well-loved and well-kept.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only problem I have tried to present is the one a preservation of the traditions, the homes, the trees, gardens, views, beauty and pride that make up northwest Denver. Much of this history and the older homes is why my husband and I chose Northwest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Denver's our home. Please learn the Anderson House to be landmarks so that your grandkids can see what made this area so special. Once torn down, it is gone forever. Like the yellow markers in this book. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Now time for questions and members of council and colleagues. I would just ask that we focus on the questions and not bleed over to comments. There will be an opportunity for comments later on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman can eat you up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. I'm guessing the first many of my colleagues are wondering about. We've heard several opinions about what's possible in this site. Did by any chance CPD themselves weigh in on that question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I. Barbara Stockman, Steely. This is kind of zoning on the fly. So I did go over during the speakers and talk to one of the zoning planners who's working late tonight. And it's hard to speculate on a prospective project that's not in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But this site has GMU three you oh three zoning. There is a requirement in that zoning for a 50 foot wide zone lot at the street and a build to requirement for 60% of the front of the of the building to be within 10 to 20 feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. So if the property the property is currently proposed to be developed as one zone lot. So if it continued to be developed as one zoned lot, there would not be an issue with the 50 foot minimum with the build to perhaps would be an issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is some compensation in the zoning for a block sensitive setback. There's also some provisions for bill to through the administrative adjustment which may or may not apply here depending on the requirements. There's also a historic preservation hardship in the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then, of course, there would be variances. And a historic preservation designation is a very typical hardship case. At the Board of Adjustment, we often go to the Board of Adjustment, write letters to the Board of Adjustment, supporting those cases.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's probably the best information that I could provide. But we often see cases where there are variances for historic properties to accommodate development, and this could be a case that would meet that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is very helpful. Thank you. My second question is for legal. One of the speakers mentioned that there was a higher standard of extraordinary importance for non owner applications. I've been combing the ordinance. I find one reference to extraordinary and it's an in or statement just in the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't find the reference mentioned by one of speakers. So I want to ask our attorneys, is there indeed a higher standard for non owner designated in the statute or in may be in case law that I can't see in front of me that would would comport with the statement that was made.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Adam Hernandez Assistant City Attorney Councilwoman You're correct. The only reference to extraordinary, I believe, is in the history criteria where it states to have historical civic significance. The structure or district shall be 30 years, 30 or more years old, or have extraordinary importance to the historical development of Denver and Shell.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then it lists three criteria underneath there. And no, there is not a higher threshold for non owner.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Initiated designations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that extraordinary. I just want to clarify, I heard you correctly that it's in or it's not in and criteria has to be one of those or the other. Not both necessarily. Correct. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Kenny G. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Nathan Adams. If I can ask you a couple of questions, please. So just to be clear, if we were to choose to designate this property, would you develop?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would I develop around the existing home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With it and around it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would not. I've vetted the zoning. And contrary to what Barbara has stated, the property would be designated historic with its own zoned lot. The remainder of frontage would be 36 feet. You need a minimum of 50 feet of width to do any semblance of build form outside of an urban house or a duplex or an accessory'",
        "'speaker_4': 'dwelling unit. We show that really clearly on page ten of the book that was handed out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the other question is, and this Levinsky from Historic Denver mentioned that you are unwilling to meet with them. What is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had a conversation via phone. She had talked about potential compromises. I even went so far as to offer her that if they would like the house after I purchased it, they'd be welcomed to the home. It wasn't designated or proposed to be designated on its geographical significance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She told me really clearly that would be of no interest and I opted not to have a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Is there anyone here from the CPD that can, given which version of the zoning might be correct? Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. I'm Barbara Stockman Seeley, principal planner and CPT for Landmark Preservation. There's no requirement that a historic property be a separate zone lot. And we've we review projects all the time that have historic buildings with larger construction on the back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm not really clear on what the. That there wouldn't be a zoning requirement for it to be a separate zone. So I'm confused by that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Barbara, if you could just come back. So that was my question about whether the historic designation would in any way, shape or form hinder the development site from being one's own lot. I mean, if you wanted to separate it out and sell it separately, then it would need to be a separate lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But if you were going to incorporate it into the development into one project, it would be one sunlight. So as if it was only be closed with the two properties adjacent to one another. And the notwithstanding the amendment that we did last week, this would still.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Allow it to be one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Zone. Correct. That's my understanding, yes. Any clarification on that from the city attorney?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm unclear right now if this property is currently one zone lot four 2329 Eliot, and then the adjacent property is another zone lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My understanding that a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Parcel or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An owner can always come in for a zone lot amendment. Granted, it would have to meet the requirements of the zoning code in order to to have a valid zone lot of amendment there are. You could go through a variance process if it did not meet certain criteria.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as Barbara stated.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't believe just because a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Structure is designated that would.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Preclude any sort of.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Zone lot of amendment on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Adam, in your experience with the Board of Adjustment Process, is there typically greater, I don't know, leniency, I guess, for lack of a better word, for historic properties?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would say there's there's not one way or the other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would just say that there is an actual specific criteria for a variance dealing with historic properties. And I think by analogy, it's kind of easier to explain if if a house was in a historic district and. The zoning limited the height to, you know, theoretically 25 feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the context of the district had houses at like 50 feet. That could be a criteria for a variance in addition to all the rest of the criteria that variance needs to satisfy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just have one last question for you, Barbara. What is the height limitation under the current zoning for this these two properties or this particular property? 40 feet. Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Is. Is Mr. Garcia still here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's not. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, my question would be only able to be answered by him, so I guess I don't have a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Sussman and Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I have a question for our city attorney. I believe in the ordinance. The city council is charged with an additional criteria, which is to look at the owner's wishes. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is correct. It might be helpful just if.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was to read a city council's criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right now it's in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Section 30, Dash 510 action by City Council upon receipt of the recommendations transmitted by the Preservation Commission. The City Council may, by ordinance, designate property as a structure for preservation or a district for preservation. Due consideration shall be given to the written views of owners of affected property, and the City Council shall hold public hearings on any'",
        "'speaker_4': 'proposed structure for preservation or district for preservation designation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Can I ask two more questions? I'm wondering in the Jefferson Park neighborhood how I think I've heard it reference that there's only one house in the neighborhood that is designated right now. And I'm just wondering, with all the interest in this house, are other people applying for designation in the neighborhood, Barbara?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Have you had applications from other homeowners in Jefferson Park?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have not had other applications.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And is it true there's just one at the moment in Jefferson Park that has been designated?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And I have one final question. Is someone here from the Jefferson Park Neighborhood Association? Yes. Oh, and we didn't hear about the the vote of the neighborhood association. And I know that in the report that Barbara did, it mentioned reaching out to a number of neighborhood organizations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd be glad to explain that. Oh. Let's see. It was September. What was it, Nathan? What was the date? September. You know the date. September 8th, I believe. Tuesday night we had a a normal board meeting and, uh, Mr. Adams had, has brought his cohorts from his business office to attend all of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'See, there were nine votes. There are seven votes that are opposed. And those seven votes all had addresses of 28, 99, I guess it's 29th Avenue. Uh, that's a rather small office. And from our perspective, well, these people were also l l and the truth be known is that they didn't represent the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so Mr. Adams here at the very last minute called for a vote. In fact, he forced a vote in which nine people voted in opposition. Seven people voted to abstain. And I'm one of those I'm a board member and we are all board members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason that we abstained is because the board had made a decision that we did not want to have this conflict coming into business. So we all abstained. And so the fact is that there were a total of nine votes who voted in opposition to historic preservation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, what has transpired since then is that the Jefferson Park Board has signed it necessary to consult with the city attorney to tighten up our regulations. And on the front page of the Jefferson Park News, the last one for November.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It states specifically that we're going to go to a vote for the specific purpose of avoiding a developer, stacking a deck with his employees and voting in opposition to what the interest is of the general neighborhood. Now, the people who are really considered to be voting members are residents, businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This did not represent a clean vote. This represented and then they paid lation of a vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Anything else?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Mr. Booth is Mr. else. And could you say your name for the record?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did you say your name for the record? Did you say your name for the record, sir? Just as you answer the question, we just needed you to state your name again for the record. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Jerry Olson. Yep. That's me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but why didn't you go revisit the vote if you felt like it wasn't fair?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, there was a very large meeting that the board called for our last general membership meeting, and we must have had 50 to 75 people present. Now, all the voting members voted to continue the vote until December, but we were thrilled, actually, that we got 50 to 75 people present at the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'station, and now we can begin a good dialog with people in the neighborhood, and then we'll go ahead and finalize revisions to the voting rules in Jefferson Park. Yeah. Jason.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Appreciate it. Thank you. Councilwoman Black. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Had a one question for maybe zoning or for legal. I'm not sure who can answer it, but the bill that we're voting on says that this is a bill for an ordinance designating 2323 West 23rd Avenue, formally addressed as 2329 Elliot Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When did the address change? And when I was doing my round of. You can answer this or Adam. When I was researching this, I discovered that no longer in the assessor's record is there a 2329 Elliott Street? It doesn't appear any more, although I can click on it and pull it up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there is no 23, 23 West 23rd Avenue address in the city. That's over when 23rd becomes Water Street. How? Why does it have this address? It's nowhere near the house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can't really answer why it has that address. I just know that partway through this process, and I believe it was after the city council approved the alley abandonment that the assessor records showed all of the parcels combined with a new address.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, Adam, what is the impact of us saying if we were to approve this designating 23, 23, West 23rd Avenue, which is nowhere near this building, if you look in the bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It actually gives a legal description, which would be the actual designation. And as Barbara said, I think it's just that the addresses have not been updated as a result of, you know, elimination processes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Under our street, numbering our address, numbering convention. This could not be 2323 Mar 23rd. So that's my goofy question of the night and I'm a little uncomfortable going forward with with uncertainty on that. Mr. President. But my second question, I think is for the woman from the Lamar Commission, was it Amy Zimmer?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know you had represented that you did not believe it was. I don't know if this is your opinion or the landmark commission, but that the houses on River Drive actually typified Queen Anne. And I'm looking at all the pictures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just as during the testimony, I called up your website, the commission website, and I discovered that the Queen Anne Bed and breakfast on Tremont Street, which is in the Clement's historic district, which is a dominant queen and Italianate style district, that those houses and the Queen Anne bed and breakfast itself do look like all these houses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on River Drive. So I'm wondering why you would tell us that, that you didn't believe that the river drive homes look like Queen Anne's?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. It's possible that the packet you have has been updated since the one that we were presented at our landmark hearing. But the one that we were presented with had a number of houses not only on River Drive, which, yes, is many Queen Anne's, but also just around the neighborhood in various parts of Jefferson Park.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they included everything from Denver squares to classic cottages, neither of which are Queen Anne's. And the developer was representing those as examples of Queen Anne's around Jefferson Park, not necessarily River Drive, but around the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fair. Thank you. Because I did drive River Drive during my research into this. And I did know that there are a lot of different styles on that street, but there are certainly a number of Queen Anne's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, there are. Queen Anne's on River Drive. River Drive is not designated historic right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And what impressed me about that was that these all look more like Queen Anne's than the William Anderson House.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The the commission did determine, including the expert advice or opinions of the architects and the historians on the commission, that the Anderson House is indeed a Queen Anne style. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And do you know who Queen Anne was? We've been talking about it all night. I just thought maybe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. A somebody who has absolutely nothing to do with Denver. Okay. I just another name on the stuff. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Thank. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Councilman New. Amy, could you let me ask you one question, please? A reverend I represent over.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Represent Denver District ten, and we have just the largest percentage of historic homes and districts in all of Denver. And I all during my campaign. And I just had the wonderful opportunity to travel and walk through all these neighborhoods and talk to a lot of the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And they convince me that their property values were significantly enhanced by historic preservation designation and it did not decrease. And I just wondered if that's the experience that the Landmark Commission has. That historic designation does increase property value and does not decline in property value.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, that is correct. We have found numerous examples where the historic designation does indeed increase the property value. This covers for several reasons, including the cachet of having a landmarked structure, and also because the error also occurs because designated structures or structures that are contributing to historic districts are required to go undergo design review under the Denver'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Landmark Commission. And this often results in them having better design and design that that is often more better thought out than properties that do not undergo that design review, which can add to the property value.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'All right. Thank you. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman. Any other questions from the council? Seen none. That concludes the public hearing. Now, moving on to comments and I will just say, colleagues, recognizing that we have another public hearing and a impending blizzard coming. If we could just take the opportunity, if you could be succinct, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If not, feel free. It's your privilege. I just want to put that out there. Councilman Flynn, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We could filibuster and wait out the blizzard if you know, that could be another choice. Thank you. I think by far the most interesting thing that I learned through all this and is that no one ever told me in my 35 years as a newspaper journalist that I could shoot an editor and be acquitted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I see John Murray furiously taking notes on that. But other than that, I have to say that I am I am completely unimpressed with the case for designating this property. I believe that it fails on both criteria that the Commission recommended.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The facts are that this House, not Mr. Anderson, but this House and Mr. Anderson, in fact, has they have no direct or substantial association with any person who had any influence on society at all. Mr. Anderson was not Alfred Packer's lawyer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He was a 48 hour fraud down in Canyon City. He never filed a document. He never represented Mr. Packer. None of the events in the story. Very interesting story. None of the events took place on his property. It's interesting to me that if that if Mr. Anderson's house is worthy of landmarking because of this episode, this brief'",
        "'speaker_2': 'episode, Endeavor's history, the home of the key figure whose being shot gave rise to this. His house still stands and his house is not a Denver landmark. Harry Tavern's house still sits on Humboldt Street. It's in the Humboldt Island historic district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it itself is not a a landmark. The house next door is but not Harry Truman's house. Why are we designating the house of the man who shot him when his house and he's a much more important figure in Denver isn't designated the support for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just think it's exceedingly thin. It doesn't make it on architecture either. It is not even a remarkable example of Queen Anne's style. I struggled over this because it was it might be well known that during the campaign I had taken a position that I would be very reluctant to do to approve a designation of a landmark'",
        "'speaker_2': 'property without the owner's consent. And even though the ordinance doesn't require it, I personally would have a higher bar. I'm very relieved, learning that the ordinance doesn't establish that as a basis that I don't have to rely on a higher bar at all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If this were an application filed by Mr. Sun Lightner to designate his own House, I would be voting no on this. I just don't find that it that it meets any of those criteria. If we relied on the stories we heard tonight, there's probably no 30 year old structure in this city that we couldn't find some connection'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to somebody who lived there once who did something remarkable. Maybe even my own house, which is over 30 years old. So I think the best reason of all that the council has to back away from this dispute in North Denver, which I think goes beyond historic structures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those issues has been given to us by the broker who found another potential buyer. Because there is. Allegedly another offer on the table and that there is no condition on this. It is not contingent on achieving landmark status.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the best course of action for the Council is to turn this down and let the market decide, let the owner decide between these two between these two offers. I think the second offer definitely shows that Mr. Swan Leitner has choices and it's not dependent on landmark designation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the other hand, if we approve the landmark designation, we are making that choice for the owner. We are telling him he cannot accept the first offer and he has to go with the second offer or look for others.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't think the strong arm of government should be used in this case. And with that, Mr. President, I think that's the summation of my remarks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you. Councilman Flynn. That's an interesting take on on the second offer. I, too, am not particularly impressed with the idea of this hostile designation, as I had mentioned in committee. It's interesting that we want to designate the home of somebody who I now learned wasn't associated with a cannibal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Probably, but certainly that was associated with an attempted murder and. I think it was Mr. Soderbergh who mentioned very discreetly that we've had a lot of interest. We've had a lot of issues with shooters that are really very tragic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the idea that we would historically designate the home of a shooter doesn't doesn't feel right in that any sense to me. We do designate the places where people were shot. I mean, we have the San Creek massacre.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't honor the home of the people who shot them. We honor the place where they died. The Ludlow Massacre. I think Mrs. Thibeault mentioned the Ford Theater, the places where people might have died. When I mention this question committee, the city person said, Well, he wasn't successful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I thought, Well, is that the new criteria? We can designate the place of a person who tried to shoot somebody but wasn't successful. It just didn't seem right to me. And what else does it seem right to me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I have great respect for the Landmark Preservation Society in the historic Denver Historic Society, but actually learning for the first time tonight that the connection with Alfred Parker is unknown and kind of loose and not too sure and maybe could make.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yet, in the document that the LPC recommends for historic status, it says, Let me just try to find this. Anderson's association with Alfred Packer is interesting and significant historically. It seems like if it can't even be discerned what his relationship was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A little bit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Overstated that it was significant historically when we're not even sure what the what it was. I heard so many people tonight speaking very passionately about historic pieces of property, and I understand that. But I heard more often a fear of development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it it also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It it resounded with me. That historic designation is important, but it shouldn't be done just to keep development out. That's why I was going to ask Mr. Garcia the question. I'm sorry. I just wanted to clear up. But he did say that he'd lose parking for his property if this project were to go through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I wondered, is was that the reason why he became one of the people who filed? He even said at the end that he was against this project, which was a little unclear to me. But I assume that what he means that it was against he is against the development but did not speak at all about the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'his history. I heard people say often that they spoke against development or neighborhood is overrun with developers about how much money is happening. The neighborhood is under siege by developers there. It was a recurring theme that I hear and I can understand that you might want to unite, not want to lose something that you feel is historic'",
        "'speaker_3': '. But I didn't hear that as often as I heard. We just didn't want this one this place developed so the are and they again though I think Councilman Flynn's idea that the offer is an interesting place that whether we designate it if we don't designate it, the owner can choose between the two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was it was difficult for me to hear sort of real estate negotiations, which seemed to me to be such private matters, to be a matter of public discussion about what I will buy, what I won't buy, or whether I should take the offer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My neighbors think I should take this offer. My neighbors think I shouldn't take that offer. That just made me itch that my neighbors would discuss real estate negotiations that I was having at a club in a public forum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will be voting against historical designation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I really appreciate it. Some of my colleagues comments. But I, I think I want to go to the statute. My my former colleague, Jenny Raab, taught me a lesson, which is to always go back to the statute.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I want to be really clear about the criteria I think we're evaluating before I comment on them. Folks have raised this word significant, and I just want to be very clear. The ordinance does not require that the individual have a significant influence on society, only that there's a substantial association between the person and the property'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Right. He lived in the house for many, many years. He owned the house for many, many years. So substantial association, I think is fairly established. The question then is with a person who had influence on society, that part of the ordinance does not state substantial, just says influence.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So an influence doesn't even say positive, could be negative, could be questionable as we're experiencing tonight. So so I just want to be really clear that the ordinance doesn't require that there be a substantial influence. And I feel like many of the speakers tonight imply that that was a criteria.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's why I went there. Secondly, distinguishing characteristic of an architectural style doesn't say extraordinary, doesn't say best in class. So so I think the ordinance sets a little bit lower bar than I heard, with all due respect.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I heard my colleague evaluating it and then I heard some of the speakers wanting us to evaluate it on. So then my question becomes, does it meet those criteria? And then there's the question of taking into account the owners views.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, so that's where I'm at in terms of the bar that I think is set. And in this regard to me, the case has been made that we really do have a case of an distinguishing characteristic. And one of the things that's interesting about anything historical is that the fewer there are of something, even if it was'",
        "'speaker_8': 'once ordinary, the more special it becomes, right? So there are many, many things at a certain point in time that are very typical. And then as they disappear, the few remaining specimens become more special to us in terms of their importance to reflecting a time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So for me, in fact, it's ordinariness or vernacular is is not at all a counterpoint to the potential that it is distinguishing characteristic style that we don't have everywhere all the time in Denver anymore because of change. I will say that although I did hear a little bit of anti-development sentiment tonight and I'm not one to I'",
        "'speaker_8': 'don't think anyone's really ever called me anti-development in my term here in the council, I tend to be pretty supportive of change. I tend to be pretty supportive of density. So but I the fact that I may have different views about development with some of the folks that are speaking or in the audience tonight doesn't mean that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I change how I evaluate the criteria. So so for me, that's how I'm going through these standards. The last piece that I, you know, in terms of weighing this against the views of the of the owner, I do like Councilman Flynn mentioned, believe that there is a higher standard when you're dealing with someone's home.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The last designation we had before us was a church, which I think is a different piece of civic, civic fabric. But when you're dealing with someone's home, I do think that it requires a higher standard. So, you know, looking through the materials and hearing the testimony, to me, what I did not hear is that this is an'",
        "'speaker_8': 'economically infeasible property to redevelop, and that is the language the ordinance use uses in other areas. It asks. In the review process. Is it economically infeasible to redevelop or reuse? And I did not hear either in the written testimony or in the spoken testimony tonight that it was infeasible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I regret the burden that that it's going to place. And I acknowledge the burden. But I also believe that there is this ordinance exists for the preservation of historic fabric in the city. So weighing those criteria, looking for, you know, a case to be made that it's not economically feasible, I did not find that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so on that basis and and actually without considering the counteroffer, that's not in my opinion, that's not a piece of this right. Analysis. So that was not just for the record, not a part of my analysis. I will be voting to support designation tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman and Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I believe in historic preservation. Many of you may remember the magnificent Republic Building downtown. My grandfather was a dentist there for many decades, and that was a tragedy when that beautiful building was torn down.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thankfully, historic. Denver Dana Crawford. All the preservationists have worked hard to save some of our buildings, and I really appreciate the work they've done. But at the same time, I do believe in private property rights and to designate a structure without the owner's permission, I do believe a higher hurdle has to be cleared.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The landmark preservation looked at the Andersen house and evaluated their criteria. We just learned that the ordinance charges City Council with the additional criteria of considering the owner's wishes. So in this case, the owner is opposed. And in reviewing the other criteria, I don't think that a strong case has been made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I, I agree with Councilman Flynn on that. The occupant did have some notoriety, but he didn't have an influence on society. And nothing significant happened in that house. I don't think it meets the higher hurdle that a hostile designation would require.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm very sympathetic to the residents of Northwest Denver and their efforts to preserve this house. I think it would be great if the house was preserved. I understand their frustrations with the great changes in their neighborhoods. I've received dozens, I don't know, maybe hundreds of letters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I've listened to the comments tonight. And as Councilwoman Sussman said, many of them have expressed their unhappiness with the development, but that is not a criteria for designation. Many of them have stated that the owner will not be harmed by the designation and that he will win no matter the outcome.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't believe it's the community's role, nor the City Council's role to speak for the owner or to decide if he will be harmed or not, or to influence who he chooses to sell his property to. Many reference other successful landmark designations like Lower Downtown and the Molly Brown House.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just think the Anderson House dims in comparison and to curtail the owner's property rights. I think that the historical significance should be extraordinary, and in a close case, the owner's wishes should prevail. As council members, again, I think we need to be very careful about placing restrictions on private property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I am in favor of historic designation, just not the hostel's designation of this property. And no matter the income, the outcome tonight, I do hope that the House will be reconsidered and that the new owner will reach out to community members.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Black. Councilman New?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. I'm neither a trained architect or a historian, and I really appreciate the professionalism and the talent on the landmark commission. And I really have to respect their work in upholding the ordinance on historic preservation. So I appreciate the three and a half hours that they do do due diligence for this application.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think that speaks highly of the professionalism and making sure that all sides are heard on on this important decision. I also have architect friends and a respected developer who I listen to as well, to have seen this house who understand the historic value of this house.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I do respect their professionalism and an opinion about this house. So to me, the historic story is interesting but is secondary to preserving the historic value of this home and a history of Denver. So I will support this designation.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Tonight. And I think that there's what I've heard there can be a real win win situation with the homeowner and any new developer or this developer. I don't think the historic designation will erode the economic value of this home, and I think there will be both a win win situation.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you both.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman there, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think I'll join in those that feel like the history of this particular designation is a tad thin. It's not the monumental story that would make this very simple. Let's see. I'll trust CPD's interpretation of the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That this property can be adequately developed. While it may not be a spectacular queen and mansion of some sort. I don't think that we're here to worship extravagance or the wealthy. But to maintain a healthy connection to our past, I think is the purpose of this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I certainly expect that. What is there now at 2329, Elliott is probably a better representation of our past, far better than what will be developed without it. I'm not happy to hear, you know, with preservation of our past so important, such a critical element, no matter how you feel about this particular piece of property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm disappointed to hear that a developer was unwilling to sit down with historic Denver and fully discuss what options might be available. So I'm also comfortable while recognizing the importance of this property to the owner. I'm comfortable that there will be a positive outcome for the owner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll be supporting designation as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",

The fact that historic properties and I was involved with, you know, the the Baker historic designation, the Jefferson Park, I mean, Potter Highlands historic designation, the lower downtown historic designation.'",

And we have seen that happen with other single homes that have been done in various communities across the city, including many of our school buildings that this body had been asked to to preserve'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and protect. And, you know, notwithstanding all of the testimony that we had tonight, I do want to thank everybody for coming and sharing their point of view on all sides. I think this designation is warranted. I will be supporting it tonight and appreciate the work that everybody has done on on both sides to share your thoughts and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'comments via email and just by being here tonight. But I think this is one where, as someone said, the neighborhood plan speaks to the internal fabric of the neighborhood trying to be preserved. You know, this neighborhood has seen significant density increases on the edges of the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I have seen the Jefferson Park community embrace that development that has come in. And it has created the opportunity for some additional amenities to be added to the neighborhood. So the fact that the opportunity still exists for development to occur, I think, again, this can be a win win for both sides.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilman Lopez, I don't see your name up, but this point you want to weigh in?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think there's a conspiracy. I kept pushing. It doesn't show. Go ahead. I'm just kidding. I first of all, I wanted to thank folks for coming out tonight. You know, I think we've seen times where you've seen these chambers completely lopsided or absolutely empty.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When you see something like this, I am going to also are in the side. I think this is this is kind of a stretch when we're looking at the historic designation. And in it it sucks because I'm very, very familiar with a lot of the challenges in Northwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilman Espinoza and I share a boundary on Colfax, and I travel up Irving and I see home after home after home for sale. And in their stead, I see shoeboxes, gray shoeboxes, with maybe a little splash of blue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they are indeed very concerning and they are a threat to the neighborhood character. I do see a redlining of certain neighborhoods where people live. I see a red lining right where you look at demographics, where people of color live and where people of color don't care for folks living where they don't and their property values and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'how they access that. I think that there is a huge problem with an overdevelopment in northwest Denver. And but I don't think this is the tool in which we fight it. And let me tell you why, because regardless of what this house becomes, historic or not, there are still a whole bunch of families who do not live'",
        "'speaker_11': 'in historic houses that can't afford and won't be able to afford to stay in northwest Denver unless they're able to get some kind of loan to access that capital that they now have. Because if they don't, somebody walk in, knocking on the door, offering 200 grand, it's going to look awfully good to pay off all the all'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that debt. So if they did survive the recession and held on to their homes and have lasted as long as they have, they may not have a home that is eligible for historic designation. So what happens then? What happens to those folks?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How we fight gentrification is not necessarily in a historic designation. And, you know, here's here's the issue for me that that that's a big one. And in that and it also doesn't sit right that our colleague who represents this district is an it can't be here and he can't be here for a reason of ethics.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And he chose not to do that. And I honor that. I think there's there's a lot to be said there, however, that cause remains. And I think that we have to address it. This is not the way we address it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it hurts to say that. It absolutely hurts to say that. But to call this house historic is a stretch for me. And also because we have to have a standard in terms of what we're deeming historic. I mean, go on by saying that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do we remember Leonard? Do we remember Chapman? I remember John Lennon, right? I don't care where Chapman lived. I don't care where his house is in Fort Worth, Texas. But I do care about everything that John Lennon produced.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right now, I'm not comparing the two. But here's another problem in how we designate history in our city. We have a whole neighborhood named after a clans leader. That does not sit well with me. That doesn't sit well with a lot of people in this city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But guess what? It's historic. We have streets in this city, in this in this very city named after people who carried scalps of our ancestors down there. And as a matter of fact, the governor at the time that was cool was shaving ten.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The largest mountain we see right here in the front range is named after him. So we have to be very careful in how we honor and who we honor. Now, I don't believe that this Anderson was a revolutionary, somebody that that was worthy of of historic designation, who had a great impact in this city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't. Now, do I agree with yellow journalism and maybe some of the shady things that those characters did at The Denver Post at the time? No. I would name after much after that either. But in order for us to create this this city and and these neighborhoods in something, we have to send a message of what'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we aspire to be, what we aspire to do, and how that history is remembered. I think it's a stretch. That doesn't mean that that the folks who came to the podium and they don't know their stuff or that that for them it's not worthy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's just for me that that that sits really wrong in my stomach. And I think, you know, I think Councilman Espinoza understands the priorities as part of Denver. He is the elected official in this part of Denver. And I think this is a challenge that is beyond.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Like I said, it goes beyond a historic designation on one home. There are thousands if not, I mean, hundreds, if not thousands of folks who are struggling to hang on. And they may not have a house that's historic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think last but not least, I think this. Jim, I your stand up guy is somebody who works so hard. And, you know, if there's anything I can relate to is everything I have, everything I worked for is in my home.'",

Regardless of which side folks fell on, it's it's a pretty close call. And so because you don't have a district councilman here tonight, I just felt like it was important to end this by saying that although designation I'm'",
        "'speaker_8': 'doing the math, it's it's not going to happen tonight. There are choices and I'm disappointed the developer didn't want to hear the choices being presented by CPD.

        "'speaker_8': 'and do a number of units. You could also ask for a variance. So there are paths to still save this house even without designation, and I hope that you will pursue or consider those while maximizing your options. That is your choice when you walk away from this meeting.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'While we're obviously experiencing significant construction boom in Denver right now. Virtually all of the vertical residential that we're seeing in town is apartments, is not condominiums.

        "'speaker_4': 'The client there was a Denver firefighter who end up losing his condo because of construction defects. His condo didn't have a defect. What occurred with his condo complex was on the north facing side. There are some ducts leaking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About 15% of the homeowners had leaky decks that were icing up on the north face. He decided to file a lawsuit. He didn't know about the lawsuit. He wasn't informed about it, so forth. He didn't find out about it until he tried to refinance back when the market crash was occurring, he found out he can't refinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The proponents are the people that are against this ordinance won't talk to you about is the impact of war instability. When a condo complex goes into a lawsuit and litigation occurs, it's no longer warranted. Wolfer for lending. Okay.'",

So in his case, since he wasn't able to refinance, we tried selling his property, we tried short selling it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Reason we had a short sell. It was because his property value overnight dropped by 50,000. He owed more than what it was worth. Okay. And ultimately, he ended up doing a strategic foreclosure on that property lawsuit wise. No one in that in that complex could have been able to refinance or sell their property unless it was a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cash investor or someone doing a portfolio loan. What is important about this ordinance is it speeds up the process. A lot of this litigation goes on for five, six, seven years. It gives an opportunity for the builder and the homeowners to come to the table and work it through arbitration.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The other aspect that's important about this ordinance is proper notification. Why not give the homeowners a right to vote on this versus leaving it to the board of that homeowner's association? I'm more than happy to provide other stories or answer any story questions later on.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. My name is Ashley Douglas and I have worked for reconstruction experts for the last six and a half years. Over the last six and a half years, I've interacted with many boards of directors and community members who are dealing with construction defect.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I know firsthand the devastating and severe impact that it's had on their lives. I have a few stories of some specific people that I've gotten to know. First would be Lorna, who loved to spend time on her patio.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and for the last few months of her life, she did not get to enjoy her patio because it was condemned as unstable. Next would be Nathan, who felt a tremendous responsibility as a board president.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He lived in a community that housed mostly active duty military, and he knew that these people were living in homes that had firewalls that were inadequately rated. And he just he knew that he had to protect them in some way, and he wasn't able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then any moment the unthinkable could happen and put these people in harm's way. Lastly would be Jerry, who called me in tears as a waterfall, cascaded down her down the walls of her home. She experienced five water losses in a period of two months due to improper grading and drainage in her community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those in support of this ordinance are putting a limit on a homeowner's ability to file a frivolous lawsuit against their builder. But are we saying that a structurally stable patio, adequately rated firewalls, and properly graded and drained communities are frivolous expectations of a homeowner?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As is written now, this ordinance makes it nearly impossible for an H way to hold their builder accountable for serious and legitimate construction defect. So much money and time is being spent on getting this ordinance to pass. But where is the conversation about holding the builder accountable for proper means and methods of construction?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What are the processes and procedures that are going to be implemented going forward to make sure our homeowners are buying products that are not defective and potentially life threatening to live in the current inspections and quality checks process has failed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the answer is simple build it right. Thank you.'",

And then an additional assessment along Brighton Boulevard, specifically for capital improvements in partnership with the city for the $26 million investment for Brighton Boulevard.'",

So as part of Keeping Rhino Wild. We are planning on rolling out a number of strategies beginning next year that specifically target affordability in the district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as you know, affordability is a very complex issue. So we're trying to figure out, you know, what different things can we put in place to impact that? That looks like we're looking at a low interest revolving loan program for small businesses.'",

For the bill in question, it's become clear to us that there are a number of people not only in Denver, but specifically in Rhino, who were there. Condos available would purchase those condos as a first entry into ownership or potentially as a second home.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And right now, because they can't, the it artificially increases the price of apartments and single family homes. So we feel like there's really pressure on these different aspects of the homebuying market and that are negatively affecting affordability and rhino.'",

And I was retrained over retained over a year ago by build our homes right to do housing market analysis which I as to my understanding most of the members of the council have received a copy of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it. What I'm going to say here tonight is basically what I said then. Markets work. Economists do believe markets work. The housing market is working in the right direction. The data is indicating that 22% of the new multi-family applications within the city of Denver have been identified as for sale properties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is without any change in the ordinance as 22%. The data also shows in Lakewood, which was the first, to my understanding, municipality to pass an ordinance. There have been no new multifamily permits to our understanding that indicate that they're for sales since that that was passed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The basic reason for this is because the market is about supply for and demand of housing. Supply always legs demand. It's supposed to and it should. You can't expect a builder to build a multifamily condominium unit and then wait for demand to come later because they would have no profits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their costs would be eaten up in that. So we expect demand to always be ahead of supply. It's a basic economic axiom. And so then the question is, well, why have there been high rent condominiums or high value condominiums and high rent rentals?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Basically because the market would say that's where the best profits have been. That's in the past few years. That's where the best profits for builders to be and developers to be, and that's where they should be. We don't expect them to build less profitable or unaffordable things at the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'More specifically about what's going on in the market, and we said it before and people and economists are saying that now the market is moving in the right direction. Demand has to be both willing and able. Lending requirements are loosening up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Earnings for millennials and minorities are improving, although not at the levels they were in 2006 or seven, but improving. So they're more able to start buying, and so demand is going up. There are also other societal types of trends.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that millennials have delayed marriage and delayed childbearing and have delayed homeownership. How much of that is a permanent trend and how much is that is simply a trend. A different trend from earlier generations is still not clear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But millennials are beginning to enter the market and they are becoming more willing, as are minorities. Then we turn to supply. What's been happening with supply? What we know about with supply and what we've been able to identify quantitatively.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'We were looking at 170 to $290000 condos. This were condos that what we called attainable housing. These were housing for seniors who wanted to move out of a three bedroom, three bathroom house and move into a condo along a transit line.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Young millennials, who people are quick to say are never going to buy a home. And I'm surprised that the person who spoke before me a year ago actually said that in public that millennials don't buy houses. 80% of millennials plan to buy houses.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'This is my hometown. I don't like what's happening because trial lawyers are shaking down the whole city. The people that work on the other side of the park here, the legislature handed them a bonanza. They are suing everybody I know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I used to be the president of a homeowners association. Townhouses outside Washington, D.C.. We were being sued. No.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Nobody could see us, counsel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry. The point I want to make is this. There are two running stories about Denver. Number one, it's the number one millennial destination in the country. That's wonderful that the best and brightest, young, bright people are moving here looking for occupations, futures.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other running story is that for the last two or three years, we've had the most rapidly increasing cost of housing in the country. Pretty soon those millennials are going to say, I don't know, I guess I'll go to Salt Lake City or Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, Texas housing is cheap there. I can't afford to live with those prices up there in that Mile High City. I'm really worried about what's going to happen here. Mayor Hancock is asking you to do the job that the people that work on the other side of the park won't do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For some reason, our governor has ignored a bipartisan majority in both houses. He won't act. He won't lead. You have to. You've got to send a strong message to those people up there, get on the stick and do this right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the meantime, as soon as you pass this. The trial lawyers will take you to court. They'll fight you for years. And who knows what judges are going to do in the state state justice system? You've got to put pressure on those people to make this law fix it.'",

I'm a retired commercial real estate broker with 30 years experience in the Washington, D.C. market. Colorado Public Radio reported this morning that slow condominium development is not unique to Denver and is, in fact a national issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yet developers have managed to convince our local representatives condo development lags because of frivolous construction defect suits that raise insurance costs as a victim of construction defects and having that many others who've had the same experience, I can assure you these lawsuits are anything but frivolous.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While your desire for more affordable housing and entry level condos is admirable, I question why you support an ordinance that does not ensure this will happen. Have representatives from the insurance industry assured you their rates will drop? Upon its passage, this ordinance requires owners to prove the defects were not built according to code.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If code requires, windows must also be installed according to the manufacturer's specifications. How did the 1000 windows in my community meet code? How is the certificate of occupancy granted? The window manufacturer and architect warned our developer by not following their specs it would lead to leaks and condensation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure enough, we heard. Excuse me. We had leaks and condensation. We only learned the developer did not follow the specs or adhere. Of those warnings through discovery, which may not be allowed in arbitration if this ordinance passes. This ordinance allows a developer to write into a condos declaration, an arbitration clause, where he can choose the arbitrator.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He can prevent discovery, and he can forbid the owners from amending that article. He holds all the cards. All this ordinance does is bind the hands of your constituents by forcing them into developer controlled arbitration and removes our right to a trial by jury.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This ordinance does nothing to require developers to build it right or hold them accountable for bad construction. I leave you with this scenario. Developer builds two buildings identical side by side, ten stories, 100 units each building. He sells his condos, building b he keeps for himself as a rental.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A few years after completion, defects start to appear. Same defects, both buildings, leaky windows being one of them. With this ordinance, the condo owners may not sue the developer, but the developer may sue the contractor for his rental building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So now you have created two classes of citizens, those who have access to the court system, but and those who do not. The developer wins millions to make repairs. But because of the restriction the developer wrote in to the arbitration clause, condo owners can't get it for first space passed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Where is the justice in that? Arbitration creates an alternate system of justice. What is the old adage? The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Please vote no tonight. Do not pave that road. Thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'market driven smart growth and higher density mixed use at the transit stops. That was a precursor to fast tracked. The tragedy now is there's about $7 billion of light rail construction and 52 stops where I don't think there's any condos for sale that are planned on the books.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We think that's that's a bad, bad thing for Denver. Our company is very concerned about affordable housing. We will deliver 400 over the last four years, 400 affordable housing units in in the in the Denver metro area, the largest in the state that a private company delivering.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Every one of those is rental. None of them are for sale. Three of them are at transit stops. All of them are our rentals. We're not interested in building condos. What you'll hear from the opponent, the opponents is, first of all, it kind of bothers me when the premise is all builders are bad.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those of us that are local and work hard, we take pride in what we do and we try and correct our problems because they do happen occasionally. They also say this is simply there's just simply no demand. I don't think you can prove a negative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'll tell you the flip side of reality. I've already told you we will not build condos even in the two or three or four transit stops that we're currently involved with. So I think I think what you've heard tonight and what I'll say to you, listen to what the proponents have had to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The last gentleman made some great comments. The fireman story has happened many, many times and has adversely affected people who owned condos and were had tainted title by virtue of the fact that there was a lawsuit that had been filed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I ask the city of Denver tonight to join Lakewood, Aurora, Commerce City and the others to send a message across the way that this is a problem that is in need of a solution. I greatly appreciate Mayor Hancock, David Broadwell and the rest of the team for doing what they've done to move this along.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I strongly urge you to support this effort tonight. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bruce Lakoff. Thank you. Members of council. I'm. My name is Bruce Lycos, and I've been a resident of Denver for 40 years. I strongly urge you to pass this bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Really? Take a look at who the burden of our housing crisis falls on today. Frankly, it falls on young folks. You know, we call them millennials. They're not all millennials, but they're looking for their first opportunity to buy a house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It falls on empty nesters, frankly, folks like me. I'm really tired of raking leaves. I was raking him this past week and I'll be raking them again. And we have virtually no empty nester housing in Denver. And the alternative for folks who are empty nesters otherwise, frankly, has Arizona, Florida and empty nesters are an incredibly valuable commodity'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for our community. In addition to their experience, they pay a lot of taxes and they demand very little in services, particularly in the schools. It also falls particularly heavy on members of our society in our city of color.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Getting housing is the very best chance to get your foot on the ladder of wealth building that we have in this country, thanks to Congress. But those are the policies and we don't have that opportunity in our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And frankly, it's also falling on our merchants and restaurants and the like, because with the incredible increase in apartment rents, we have loads and loads of people paying way more than the recommended 30% of income on housing. That means less dollars available for restaurants, merchants, cultural facilities and the like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, the money's, you know, coming out of somebody's pocket. The other thing I would point out is that Denver isn't a competition. Our friendly neighbors to the east and west, both of whom are in light rail lines, have already adopted these ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one thing I can tell you, because I've represented developers for most of those 40 years, is they're pretty smart people in figuring out opportunities. And so if they're looking at sites, for example, on the west side of Sheridan Boulevard and the east side of Sheridan Boulevard, and the primary difference is that on the west side of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sheridan Boulevard, their risk of getting sued and losing millions is a lot less. They're pretty smart. They're going to figure that one out quickly. The other thing I'd like to mention is a few things you heard tonight that probably need a little clarification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You heard earlier that there has been a substantial increase in applications for permits for multi-family housing. What you didn't hear is that those are virtually all townhomes, not condos. Townhomes are lovely. It's part of our mix. We need it, but they're not very dense and they're not going to house very many people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You also heard that Lakewood passed an ordinance and they haven't had any condos built yet, which may be true. But I can also tell you from personal experience that developers are at least talking to Lakewood about projects. I can't promise any of those will happen or when they'll happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if you don't open the door for developers, nobody will even be talking to Denver. And the last thing that I want to comment on is we heard a few minutes ago that under the current system, developers can select arbitrators with a suggestion that they would automatically be unfair arbitrators.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, the ordinance you have in front of you tonight would require that any arbitrators be third party impartial neutrals, which is actually a very protective approach for consumers. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, John Stovall.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. President, council members, thank you for taking time to to listen to some opinions tonight. I'm a real estate broker, have been in Colorado for 42 years, a realtor for most of those years. I actually succeeded in retiring from that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now I'm a resident in a high rise condominium in the tech center area, 266 units. In fact, Miss Livia is the president of our association and I am the Treasurer. Our building is one that definitely was impacted by construction defects and not just a few windows on one side, but every unit in our building had construction defect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'repairs that were needed in the unit. So it is something that is of serious interest. And basically the the problem of affordable housing is a totally separate problem. It is a problem that needs some solution. But this isn't it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This isn't what's going to make that happen. This bill seriously erodes a basic right of our citizens, and that is to take their grievances to court. It made a big difference in our situation. Just let me mention a couple of things that were in our original declarations, which, under this ordinance would become extremely difficult to alter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our original documents required that we had to have permission from the developer to sue the developer. Not likely. Oh. And as long as they had one unit in the property, they had absolute veto. They just say no. And that, by the way, would apply to arbitration as well as it would to litigation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even with the developer's permission, it would have required 80% vote of the owners. Mandatory arbitration was required, but they specified that they got to pick the arbitrator. With 42 years in real estate. I've seen arbitrations and I know they can be excellent and I know they can be harmful because the arbitrators go one way or another at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'times. Oh, under the declarations, Discovery was virtually ruled out until we were already into a legal action, and then only with the permission of the arbitrator, we would not have found a number of the serious problems in our building, or at least not the cause for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Had we not had access through discovery to company records from the developer and the builder. Again, this related to windows leaking. Windows were installed so that the manufacturer canceled the warranties for every window.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Sobel, your 3 minutes is up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Please don't pass this ordnance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Joe Rogers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. Thank you. The council president, Herman Herndon and honorable council members. My name is Joe Lasseter's. My address is 1430 Larimer Square, Suite 200 and Denver. I'm the chairman of the downtown Denver Partnerships Management Group.

        "'speaker_4': 'in the Rocky Mountain region. I'm also here as a developer, which I'll talk about in a minute. Last month, the downtown Denver, Inc board of directors unanimously voted to support Council Bill 811. We believe that diversity of housing options and price points in our center city is essential for sustaining this vibrant 24 seven world class downtown and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'council. Bill 811 will help us achieve this goal. In 2007, the Downtown Denver Partnership and the city and county of Denver created the downtown area plan. This plan was the guiding vision for the next 20 years of downtown Denver and set a goal of adding 18,000 new housing units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where are we with this? Well, in 2007, 112 rental units were constructed and 874 sale units. Now, let's flash forward to 2012. 709 rental units versus zero four sale units. And finally, so far in 2015, 1777 multifamily units have been constructed and 59 condominium units have been built.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with all due respect to, you know, previous people who provided testimony tonight, we have a problem and it is a Colorado problem. And I understand that that this this bill may not be everybody's perfect solution for this, but we have a problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'd really like to see the council provide some leadership with this. Yes, we wish it could be solved at the state house, but we really need some leadership. I'll tell you, as a developer, I can't develop condominiums.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first question my insurance company asks me is Have you developed multifamily residential housing for sale in the past ten years? Are you planning on developing if I answer yes to those questions? They are not interested in providing insurance to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's just simply off the books. My banker wants to know the same thing. And not only will a banker not provide financing for these projects, my banker would would see me doing those kinds of projects are putting me at risk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think it's really important that we provide some leadership tonight. I really hope that you vote in favor of House Bill 811. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we have David McLean.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Members of council. My name is David McClain. I'm an attorney in Denver, a resident of District four, and I represent homebuilders. And I am here tonight to talk a little bit about what I've heard from some of the folks that have spoken in favor and against the proposed bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, with respect to Mr. Nash talked about the problem with the existing state law, and I did want to touch on that because there's a component of Bill 811 that fixes that problem and that problem. If you look at the restriction or how building codes can and can't be used in construction defect litigation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Section ten 202 looks a lot like part of the Construction Defect Action Reform Act, and it comes from the Colorado Statutes 1320 804 which is a restriction on negligence claims under sadara for alleged construction defects, saying that you can't have a negligence claim for a technical code violation unless that causes damage to real or personal property or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a threat to health or safety. And the issue with Colorado law is that when that restriction was put into the law in the early 2000s, it was effective. And it was effective because at that time, builders were still able to disclaim implied warranties, implied warranties of the claims that get asserted in these cases that are have been'",
        "'speaker_4': 'likened by the appellate courts to strict liability for construction defect claims. In 2007, the plaintiff's bar passed or had the legislature pass the Homeowner Protection Act. So as of 2007, builders can no longer disclaim implied warranties, causing there to be a strict liability standard for construction throughout the state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So where the legislature originally had a right in including a restriction on negligence claims it didn't go far enough and that it didn't affect other claims. This ordinance does. And this ordinance kind of writes the where the legislature left off in the early 2000s in Sadara and later in the Homeowner Protection Act and I think puts construction'",
        "'speaker_4': 'defects back where it should be, that technical code violations should be a construction defect and should be actionable in situations where it impacts the performance of the House, causes a loss of use, causes property damage, or a threat to life or safety.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A few other points informed consent. There's been some talk that that 51% is too high a threshold. And I just want to speak to that and say that on a firsthand basis. I've been involved in situations where homeowners associations have overcome that and have moved forward with an action.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then finally, with respect to the idea that there's a right to a jury trial, I just want to dispel that and say that that's not true.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. McClain, you're 3 minutes is up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Please support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The bill. Next, we have Mike Cup. And after that last speaker, George Krueger. So you can come up as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the council. My name is Mike Capone, the executive director of an organization called Colorado Concern. Colorado Concern is an A and an organization made of 120 plus CEOs across the state. Our main interests are economic in nature, so therefore we care about a vibrant economic outlook for the state of Colorado, which'",
        "'speaker_4': 'means principally, of course, jobs. And we are seeing more jobs come to the state. But as it relates to the conversation tonight, of course, new job seekers need a place to live. When you step back and you look at the fact that really it is incumbent upon policymakers, in my opinion, to set policy that will encourage things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that are so fundamental to be an American, like the ability to get into a home. So my first point really has to do with availability. Policymakers can make all kinds of policy choices that do make it more difficult to access affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no question about this. Policymakers do it all the time on a range of issues. So for some to suggest that the decision that you make as it relates to construction defects won't have any impact on the availability of housing, I think has is demonstrably true.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fact, what we're seeing here in the Denver market, in the Colorado market, I believe, is you're seeing upward pressure being applied on housing specifically because of the policy that that we have in place now. I think the bill that you have before you is a good one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I thank you for taking it up and I thank you for putting up with a lot of folks to come out on a snowy night to talk about this. Secondly. In the last few seconds that I've got here, I'd like to speak to the issue of accountability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's been suggested that really there are no other provisions wherein a homeowner could have problems fixed outside of litigation. And I would just I would just ask you to think about that statement or that very idea for a moment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How many times in your daily lives do you need litigation to solve problems? There are other mechanisms in place in daily life that work, common sense solutions that work, that help people get through problems quickly. You've got a good solution in this bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ask for your support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And last, Speaker George Krueger.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Good evening, counsel, and thank you for letting me speak. My name is George Krueger. I live on Capitol Hill. I want to make a couple comments here from the bill that's actually come starting in Section ten, does 202 under see says the building codes adopted in Article two of this Chapter ten are intent to establish'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a minimum standard for safe and sound construction in Denver. And that same thing, if you go up to a in a violation of any building code as adopted in Article two of this Chapter ten, or a failure to substantially comply with any such code shall not create a private cause for action, a violation of any building code'",
        "'speaker_6': 'as adopted in Article two of this chapter, or a failure to substantially comply with any such code may not be used to support or approve any construction defect claim, regardless of the statutory or common law theory under which the claim is asserted, except for actual damages or possibility damages to life and limb.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This does not address any loss of value in the property or any insurability. I understand this bill is brought forward to promote condo development and I can understand that we need a bunch of different solutions for people that are looking for housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if the developers no excuse to bust Caldwell there cannot ensure that they and their subcontractors can meet or exceed the building codes. Maybe they shouldn't be built working in Denver anymore. I would have to agree with Mr. Sekou Adam Maldonado and Ashley Douglas that if you want to build the condos, do it right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because obviously all this litigation over the past few years and the fact that you cannot get your development's insured because of past defects, obviously is going to have to take a while to overturn again. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. All right. We got to everyone just in about an hour. Thank you all for that. It is now time for questions. And once again, colleagues, let's make sure we focus on questions and we'll have comments afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I've got several questions. And if other people well, we we have a list here of people waiting. So let me just first ask our city attorney in the drafting of this and the dialog with different parties, were insurance companies part of the folks that were talked to?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And did they if so, did they believe that this language would make any change in their reduction of costs of insurance on for sale units or condos?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The answer is yes. Among the many people we talked to and and pick their brains were representatives of the insurance industry who basically explained to us kind of the reality of a kind of a chicken and egg problem you've got here, where the problem with the lack of availability and affordability of insurance is driven by claims history'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in the past under prior law, and it reaches a certain critical mass where certain insurance underwriters choose to leave the market, are priced their products at a very high level. The problem, as we talked about it in committee, is that there has to almost be a new paradigm established on the ground where you've got new construction occurring'",
        "'speaker_10': ', where condos would again resume to be built. And then you'd have to see what the new claims history is related to them and how these laws play out over time in terms of whether or not it's going to have an effect on the overall availability and price of their products there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To get to this specific thing, I think you're asking. No, there is no definite answer that this bill solves the problem in terms of the lack of availability or affordability of insurance. This bill, the feedback we get in the way we've gotten is may help, may help, but no absolute assurance that it's a silver bullet.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as some of the speakers acknowledged, it probably has to be a combination of some local action as well as state action over time. So there is no definitive answer to that in terms of saying that this this will solve the issue and cause the floodgates to open in terms of new construction from their perspective.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So another question, in looking at the drafting of the language, did the issue of trained workforce come up as part of the sort of the big picture equation because. I think that plays a big role. There's so much construction going on in this city that we've had.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People reach out to my office where there are builders on a particular project that are being bringing people in from other countries who aren't necessarily the skilled workers that are needed. And, you know, I don't know whether that plays a huge role in whether those folks know exactly what they're doing, that they can read the plans that'",
        "'speaker_5': ', you know, they've got the math skills to measure things adequately, etc., etc.. So did that come up at all in the conversations?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The availability of trained workforce was never mentioned to us by anybody as part of the problem. There is obviously substantial workforces out there building things. A lot of things are getting built. They just don't happen to be condos.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But but no. It really has been a part of the conversation to date or anything. We've heard from anybody as being part part of the explanation for why there may be a lack of condo construction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'David, one other question about the role of our inspectors. So I don't know today if our inspectors are cross-trained to be able to go out and inspect roofing and, you know, or if we have specific trained skills for the different sectors of the construction industry so that when they are doing the inspections, they're not all cross-trained and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'just know a little bit about each category versus people who are experts in their in their own field. And I'm just so so that's one question. What are what is the level of of our inspectors? And then tied to that is if we're not doing adequate inspections and we're approving work that is found to be not correctly'",
        "'speaker_5': 'constructed. What is our liability?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Sky Stewart Mayors Office, I'll start with the beginning of that and happy to get you more specific information. Our inspectors over the last number of years have had the ability to be cross-trained. I can't tell you on the ground if everyone is out there doing various inspections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We do have a system set up where they could do that. But our inspectors are professionals who are trained and certify work to be code compliant. So I can't say that I believe that there's a case out there where somebody's a certifying work that is not code compliant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's their job to certify that work as code compliant or two sided if it's not and have that work corrected. As far as liability, I'm going to turn that over to David.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The the liability issue from our perspective. On any regulatory matter, governments enjoy a high degree of governmental immunity in terms of our we pass laws, we do inspections, we do the best we can. But given the color of Governmental Immunity, Act explicitly says that failure to adequately inspect is not a cause of action for a claim against'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the government itself. That's why all of this is fought out between the private parties versus the homebuyers and the home builders and the design professionals and so forth. You know, obviously, even though that's the pat answer from a liability standpoint, the city strives to take seriously the laws that pass passes and staff up and do adequate inspections'",
        "'speaker_10': '. But certainly some of the stories that are told by folks who've had claim situations in the past have to do with potentially a failure by both in both the construction site and the inspection side. Those things in the imperfect world we live in obviously happen at some time and on some occasions and are actionable when they do'",
        "'speaker_10': ', but they don't tend to be actionable back against the government for failure to adequately inspect. One of the things that you all of which have provided budgetary support for. We are trying to staff up more. Our building inspections office overall because of the sheer level of activity in town.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we're probably going to be approaching record levels in terms of the commitment of resources to that. But but yes, it is definitely imperfect, but when it is, the claims tend to be fought out between the private parties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. President, you want to just put me at the end because I do have other questions and I know my colleagues do as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilman, new.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Question, dave broadwell as well. David, i heard concerns tonight about problems, defects that are related to violation of the building code or the manufacturer's recommendations or just really a general lack of quality workmanship. You know, there's nothing in our ordinance that prevents an actionable action against the correction of any of that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'In our audience at all, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah, that that's correct. And I try to emphasize that point in my introductory remarks. There are basic avenues to redress where you where you have a defect resulting from a CO deficiency or for some other reason, where you have a defect that causes damage and is traceable to negligence or traceable to some fraudulent misrepresentation by the builder'",
        "'speaker_10': 'or the seller of the unit. Though those statutory causes of action remain fully actionable, notwithstanding anything in this ordinance. So, you know, and I would say as your attorney, we we we couldn't give any different answer than that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city doesn't have to have the ability to take away the basic redress that plaintiffs are guaranteed under state law.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so the state law applies. We have minimized any any protection from the homeowner by state law.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In my opinion, this ordinance does not.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. New Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Ashley Douglas. I don't know if you want to come up, but when you came up, you mentioned three specific situations an unstable patio, inadequately rated firewalls and improper grading. I don't know the specifics on the unstable patio, but I can tell you that inadequately rated firewalls is a code defect, meaning is a code non code compliant'",
        "'speaker_4': 'situation. Now, does our new ordinance, as I understand it, prevent that from happening? No. Does it make it against the law? Technically it already is because it's non-compliant. And so the time to address that is during the construction when that's spotted, because you're not going to spot it after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, you could spot that, something like that after the fact, but then it's still not defective because you don't know until you have an incident whether it's going to breach or fail or whatnot. You may have a reasonable reason to fear, and that's one of these sort of caveats that you guys can litigate later.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But an improper grading is a code, is noncompliant is a code. So there's certain things that if you have water intrusion from, you know, you have the loss, this law protects you. You know, that's that's the whole point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I guess I won't ask the specifics on the unstable patio. It's just that it's not you cite these instances that are that are definite issues that you know and have ramifications. But if there's a loss, this law protects you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, it's not those were not code compliant installations. So the combination of both the non-compliant installation or workmanship and the loss would make you want to put you in the avenue for recovery in. So, yes. Now you get into the other aspects of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to make sure you have a question. I'm just watching the minutes tick away, and I haven't heard a question yet, so I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Haven't gotten to speak all night.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we're still in a good time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right, then. No, I do have a question for both Pat Pacey and Mary, Latvia. So, yeah, I just but it's worth pointing because these things come across and they sound like they're they're they're issues, but they're not issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So for Pat Pacey, the 22% for sale multifamily is that what is the breakdown of townhouses versus condos not present? Okay. That is a question I've asked and I would really like it answered.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not here. She's not here. She is not here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mary, Latvia. Lithuania, Latvia. You had stated that rental owners can sue, but condo owners cannot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I didn't say rental. Well, yes, the developer can sue for construction defects in his rental property, and I cited the two buildings side by side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the condo owners under this law.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Have to go through arbitration. They don't have access to the courts. And how the developer rights that arbitration clause is can be very controlling and make it extremely difficult for the owners to to win an arbitration. Whereas under if they go to court under the existing laws, they have discovery, they have many more means available to them'",
        "'speaker_3': '. How are how how are homeowners, especially in affordable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Housing, going to pay for all of this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would arbitration have prevented you from finding resolution on the matters that were present in your property?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, because through arbitration we wouldn't we were not allowed discovery in. It's in discovery. We found the emails from the architect and the window manufacturer outlining everything they were doing wrong and what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The developer did. He fired the architect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that wasn't that couldn't be discovered forensically.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If the developer chooses to write in the arbitration clause that discovery is not allowed, we will be bound by that. And he can do that through David.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We repeat that nothing about this ordinance stipulates any particular format for arbitration. The principle of the ordinance is to say when people have bought into a community where arbitration is in the covenants, the city law supports the viability of that contract.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right now, the we've we've built in specific things to say, but city law supports arbitration clauses with some prophylactic claims, we say, but only if they have a neutral arbitrator who has to give full disclosure that follows the substantive law of construction defect claims and happens in Denver, Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so we've we've said we honor and support and reinforce those covenant clauses if they have that minimum level of protection. We don't talk about discovery. We don't talk about any other details in terms of what would have to be in the covenants for Denver law to reinforce and support it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So there may be a myriad of things that might be in the covenants that are that aren't addressed in our audience at all. But again, the basic principle is to say that if it's part of what you bought into and it's in it's hard wired in there, it can't be taken away later.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Those are the terms and conditions under which claims in your community will be arbitrated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I mean, that seems it seems sort of you know, you can't if I'm understanding you, right, David? Again, this goes back to the first part of this law. So basically, if if this if this if this non discovery component was there and they purchased under with those in place, at least they knew about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's that's neither here nor there, in my understanding that that's I mean, it's certainly within their right. But it's the buyers. It's it's the buyer. It's it's in that contracting process that they are both made aware and assuming that that covenant or clause.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That that's the principle underlying the ordinance said that that is correct. Now, let me just point out that and there's also a cross-reference to the uniform arbitration law, the Colorado State Statute, which does contemplate describe discovery and arbitration proceedings.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. The witness is giving an example of where it was taken out in the arbitration clause in her particular covenants. But I'm as I'm saying, it's not inevitably that way. There may be discovery. There may not. It just depends upon the details of the particular covenants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what developer wouldn't write that into his declaration in order.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To protect himself seriously?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, you know, but again, then you have to, as a buyer, have to choose.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To be where. And you're talking about affordable housing. How many people read those documents and understand everything? So once again, the onus is put on the owner and I'm sorry, I why not build it right? Why not just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Build? And that's actually where I'm that's where I'm actually going, which is what is build it. Right? Is it is that code compliant or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Build it right is to take extra time to ensure that when you mix the concrete it's not over mixed and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It to to meet code or meet some higher standard than code to me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Code. Well, to meet code because.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's all this law is saying is our expectations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For this meeting. I mean, you know, our windows met code, but no, they didn't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've now reviewed that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so at the time our building was built, it was code. It was code. And then when the developer was warned, he not only fired the architect, he he, the window manufacturer, wouldn't provide a warranty. And we never knew about that until we got to discovery.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So, you know, I mean, we're pro-development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're not anti-development. But I don't my my cost alone would have been $24,000. You go to affordable housing and you say to somebody, you need to come up with five grand to file this claim and then maybe they'll win something.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But then you need to come up with 10,000 more to make up the difference. How many people in affordable housing are going to have an extra $15,000 laying around? So what happens? A third of them can't do it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The other two thirds have to pick up the slack. It they can't do it. First thing they do, they cut back on maintenance on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Figure out a way to sort of not get into this sort of endless spiral of litigation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, it goes on. So it was built right to begin with. If they would just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Write code compliant?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not necessarily. I don't think so. But how do you prove it? You know how we would approved. Ah, we had to inspect every window. They weren't. There was no thermal brake. Do you know how much money that cost to inspect a thousand windows?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Speaking in the spiral. Councilman Espinosa, I just we appreciate the dialog between the two of you, but I think there's a back and forth versus do you have any more questions for Mr. Villa or for anyone else currently answering?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ms.. Livia and I thought I had one more for David, actually. Go ahead. I missed it. If it's in there, the the American Arbitration Association, is there is there a reason why we don't why we put why we put the arbitration language in a way that I mean, why we don't actually just say that it has to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'go through an independent third party rather than sort of let the two parties work it out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, there is the reference to the fact that the Denver law supports only the use of neutral arbitrators. But but if you're asking, you know, why the ordinance doesn't list a particular organization, for example, to provide the arbitration services.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And in general, my recommendation as a city law, I shouldn't do that. Contracts, yes. And contract drafting. The parties may agree this is the place will go to get the arbitrators to use in the event that there's a dispute under the contract.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But generally, my view is it's not proper in a law to name a particular private organization to provide a particular service. But but the concept of using a neutral arbitrator who must make full disclosure and if he's later found to have a conflict, can be basis for reversal of his award.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. Those those key principles are built into the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, we do review the code on a regular basis, as there may be an avenue there to sort of address that in a more fluid manner.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Which code would that be?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The building code, the one that basically this then rolls into as a standard.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of you, Bill, you will be reviewing all the all the that the new code adoptions early next year and there may be some additional part of this discussion you want to have at that time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just to be clear on that last line of conversation, I just wanted to be clear. Mr. Brouwer, also in this process, just to be clear, who selects the arbitrator? Is it the developer alone? Do they set the rules or is it is it both parties?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This ordinance doesn't dictate who selects the arbitrator. That, again, would be one of the myriad details that would be addressed in the covenants, the covenants. We'll talk about all kinds of details related to the arbitration process that aren't dictated by this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, the principle is if it was buyer beware and someone bought into a community that had an arbitration clause that we intend to support that as the contractual commitment made by the parties, whatever the details may be. So in science, in some in some examples, maybe in most examples, the neutral arbitrator will be selected by the defendant'",
        "'speaker_10': 'or by the by the builder. But you just don't know. It depends upon the details of the covenants in question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Would we have the right to dictate those terms, as in the audience that the arbitrator selected by both parties?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, there's an enumerated list that I've summarized just a moment ago of. At. At Page nine of the bill that does what I described a moment ago that says the city supports the inviolability of these arbitration clauses as long as they contain these basic elements.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If you wanted to add a longer list of things, the covenants would have to include to have the support of city law. Then that's where it would be. This represents some of the key concerns we've heard and also reflects a little bit Senate Bill 177, which passed the Senate earlier this year in terms of just not any'",
        "'speaker_10': 'arbitration clause, these basic elements of fairness. But we don't attempt to start getting into further micromanagement of the process beyond the elements you see listed here on page nine.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And one final question, Mr. President. This is something that I you know, in looking at I mean, what I need to do in this committee work on the floor. But, you know, when when I was looking at the different things that were changing, one of the things that really stuck out was, I think this the notification'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and the idea that 51% of the tenants or owners would they would be the decision maker. They'd have to have 51% of those owners or tenants. Right. To decide whether to pursue any kind of legal remedies or not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Here's that here's the question I have. I know. Mr. Braswell, maybe you can you can help me think through this real quick or just like. Yes, the question I have is that 51% of what is it, 51% of all of the owners slash tenants?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there's a second part to my question. What if not everybody, what if not all of those tenants respond? Does that count against the 51%?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The way the ordinance has drafted the consent would have to come from a majority of the unit owners. Tenants have nothing to do with their agreement. So these are the unit owners, not counting any units that are still in the ownership of the original declarant.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it's intended to be fair. Those have actually passed into private hands. You'd have to have majority consent of those folks. Now, one of the things I had a colloquy with one of your colleagues on on this key point, one thing that is more favorable to the homeowners associations in our proposal is this idea that you can'",
        "'speaker_10': 'take as much time as you want getting those sign offs and approvals from that number. There's no 30 day deadline. There's no 60 day deadline as there is in some of the other proposals we've heard that some of the other ordinances we've seen out there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it's open ended in terms of how long it might take. But you affirmatively need written signoff from that majority in order to meet that threshold and go forward with a claim.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is there any kind of stipulation that goes beyond that or does it does it are we are we? I guess what I'm running into in my mind is the situation where not everybody who is a party to it or those unit owners actually responds that say the majority of them just don't respond.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And you can't force somebody to say, Yeah, I want to participate. You've got my consent or not. Does that count against you?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's right. The non-response is tantamount to a no vote when a law is written like this. And there are other examples of laws that are written like this where you had to have to achieve a certain target percentage in order to go forward with fill in the blank.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that has to be manifested by written consent in a variety of contexts and other kinds of laws.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And I guess and I'm sorry for having to go down this route. I just want to be clear. If there are multiple owners, let's say there are two owners per unit, it's those both of those owners individually as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It depends upon how their ownership interest is characterized. But again, the denominator in the numerator are units. So you have so you have to have a certain number of the ownership of a certain number of units can consent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And in some cases, depending upon if there's joint or mutual ownership, it may be both of them or and maybe one of them that would have to give that consent, depending upon how it's set up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Brown. Mr.. Mr. President, I know that there are other folks that are in the queue. I think my, my, my concern is the lack of participation probably by some folks. They just don't want to respond.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think what that does is that. Makes it even harder for someone to get that consent. And anyway, I'll bring I'll bring that up later. I do have issue with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Catherine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. David. My understanding that the ordinance that we're proposing does not talk about right to repair. Is that correct? The state law does, however, does it not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That our ordinance, unlike most of the other municipal ordinances that have been adopted, does not address right to repair at all? We have there are a number of reasons, both policy and legal, that the mayor chose to not try to tackle that issue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But but to respond to the latter point of your comment. Not right to repair, but opportunity to repair is written into SADARA the Code of Construction Defect Action Action Reform Act in the sense that the very detailed like cookbook type procedures that define the notice of claim process under that statute.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And at one point in that process, the builder can offer to repair, but the homeowners association is not compelled to to accept it or to allow the original builder back into the project to do the repairs. So there's a definite procedure for offering, but no obligation that the offer has to be accepted on the other side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some of the other municipal ordinance ordinances that have tackled this subject kind of flip it a little bit from the standpoint of giving the builder the opportunity to offer and require, and the homeowners association would be required to allow them back in.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But one of the main policy reasons this wasn't included, as we know, this is a very incendiary issue among the homeowners associations who, if they feel aggrieved at the defects that they believe were caused by the original builder, they may not necessarily want to deal with the original builder in terms of being forced by a law to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'require the original builder to come back in. So we knew it was very controversial from the homeowners perspective. But but also, as I said at the top, we're trying to stay away from altering or conflicting with any of the details in the notice of claim process and the state statute itself in terms of the the philosophical approach'",
        "'speaker_10': 'we're taking in our ordinance. But but it's an often asked question because everybody kind of knows that it's a part of the mix of the debate out there. That right to repair is seen by some as being kind of a key to all of this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But we just don't go there in our proposal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. One more question, which I was going to ask you, Mr. Coble, if he's left of any of you out there who are hoping that we pass this ordinance. I'm wondering if it passes, what specifically in this bill would cause you to go ahead and start building condominiums?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Anybody out there?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please come to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bike and come to Michael.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. The rest of you are cowards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. I guess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You say your name for the record again?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Aaron Foy was full of our builders, and. And I think by mine, the one thing that. That sticks in my mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is this majority vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Before I became a homebuilder, I was an attorney for ten years and and did some defense of home homeowner cases against builders. And. And in my mind, if there's something wrong, it should.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Get.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fixed. The issue is that relatively minor problems turn into major lawsuits, and issues that could get fixed are not allowed to be fixed. And I think having.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A majority vote of all members of the association really.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Slows down the process so that someone can come in and fix it. And in my mind, that helps us tremendously. And as I said earlier, we've got investors and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Banks who are scared to death of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Stuff. And anything that we can give them to make them feel more comfortable helps us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. And the other question again, anybody. If it's you, what what I'm wondering about so it's I guess everybody's guess that if this passes tomorrow, insurance rates don't drop. They may down the line. My guess is by the time they drop that the economy will have changed and will be tough to figure out why they dropped so'",
        "'speaker_6': 'today. So you're going to build a $200,000 condo with the higher insurance rates. What's the price of that condo? Is it 230? Is it 410? I mean, I'm trying to get an idea of what the scope is. I think.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think this helps in a few.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ways.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One is is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As I said earlier, we're building a three story, you know, buildings in five story zoning. If we're able to build five story buildings or can convince investors that it makes sense to do that, we get more density. The relative cost of our land purchase goes down as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We will still have to pay our insurance and it does increase the cost of building. But it's not that 200 to 410. It's these other things like land cost. It's things like like who we need to get money from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can't go to a bank and get a get a 4%, four and a half percent construction loan. I need to go to two groups that are a little more risk. You're willing to take the risk, but they charge us more for their money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So all of that adds up and and makes it difficult to build that $200,000 or $230,000 condo. But if we're able to convince those groups that the risk isn't that great and these types of ordinance help us do that, then we're able to to get to that sort of price point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman and Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Is John Stovall still here? John. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you, and I put you on a spot. Maybe you have the silver bullet. Because I think you said that you recognize that there is a need for some changes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was wondering if you knew what they were. Oh, despite all of my glorious experience. No, ma'am, I do have it. Do you have any suggestion for changes that ought to be made in terms that aren't in this bill, in terms of affordable housing or accessible housing, whatever you want to call it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Probably the only answer in our current kind of market, which is so hot, is indeed public support to the builders, meaning subsidy, a subsidy of some sort to the builder to to get that 300,000 down to to 75 or to 75 down to to 50.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, it isn't. And the degree of that is a matter of the ability of a community to step up for that. There are a fair number of subsidized projects in the rental business, but we see almost none of it in the ownership business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, David. I had thought that I came out of the committee meeting on this a few weeks back with a pretty good understanding of the neutral arbitrator provision. But I'm hearing something different tonight. And so maybe it was my misunderstanding, but the selection of a neutral arbitrator is not actually spelled out here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's spelled out in state statute. We just require them to follow the state law on. Arbitration. And what I thought I heard you say tonight was that A the developer itself could select a neutral arbitrator. Is that because in my mind, that's not a neutral arbitrator?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well well, there's got to be some sort of selection process. Right. And, yes, that's possible. But the. But the way neutral is defined in the Uniform Arbitration Act means no affiliation and no predisposition with with the developer. Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so that selection could occur. And I guess the premise of your question, they inevitably then they're prejudiced toward the person that selected them. But the definition of neutrality means they cannot have any any intrinsic business interest or relationship with whoever has selected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Between tonight and next week on final. I would like I'm going to look at the state statute a little more and maybe I maybe I'll send you some more e-mails over the weekend or something.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a fact, and I'll be happy to send you that. What I was just quoting and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That would be a lot easier than some of your other questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm sorry that Miss P.C. left because I wanted to follow up. She wasn't able to finish her her presentation on her economic study. But we I think it's been granted. And David, I think you said in your presentation that this isn't the only factor that is causing the lack of construction of for sale, multi-family units'",
        "'speaker_2': ', condos. What are some of the other factors?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'She definitely would have been the best one to ask. And you may others in the room, may, may, may, may have some perspectives on this also. But you all have probably heard and this is addressed in her extensive study that they published in the last year, that after the recession and the foreclosure crisis, there were major changes'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in terms of qualification standards for for for financing, for home financing. And that changes the market dynamics right there in terms of who's able to to afford and get into any kind of for sale product, including condo products as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think we all know that. And I think one of the speakers alluded to this is that is that, you know, undoubtedly there are overall market forces that drive up the cost of everything because we're so cool and so many people want to live here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And so there are basic land economics that make things more expensive in Denver that are beyond the insurance issue. Right. And that and that affects everything in terms of the affordability issue. But but others have commented on some some more some some tangential things about the the level of college debt now, which certainly didn't exist in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'our generation. And that causes people perhaps to delay their home purchase decisions until a later time. And so there's a lot of theories out there about what what changes there have been in market forces, such that the kind of very, very, very low cost condos that were so common back around 1980, for example, even if condo supply'",
        "'speaker_10': 'resumes, it may not tend to be at that really low price point because it's a different world now. Condo projects tended to spread out more, and now we're more into an infill mode in intrinsically expensive locations, in urban environments and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So a lot a lot of factors like that. So what we're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Doing is we are we're just taking a bucket of water out of a bathtub or out of a larger vessel or out of an ocean. We don't really know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And again, others may want to to add to kind of my recollection of some of the other things that have some credibility in terms of affecting the issue to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I don't really know because of the hour. I really do want to explore this fully because this is a this is a very serious issue. And there are well-meaning people on both sides. I just want to. Sure, I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going to try to go quickly and maybe keep answers short. But I'm I'm a little concerned about one of the clauses on page seven. I'm sorry, page nine. No, it's seven. I'm sorry. B, paragraph B, majority consent of unit owners required.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what I read in here is it says that the written consent from owners other than the declarant of units to which at least a majority of the total votes are allocated. Does that mean that in the covenants and this is based on something you said earlier, can the builder require 80%?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can the builder require more than 50% plus one? Can the builder require a 100% consent before a claim can be pursued under this?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is an example of where the ordinance itself is dictating the threshold and it is 50%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So the builder and under our ordinance a builder in Denver cannot in a covenants require 60% or supermajority. If 50% plus one signed on, then they can file a claim.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I confess I haven't thought of that question or the answer is at least that through about whether someone then would by covenant require some greater level, that this ordinance just doesn't address that at all. This ordinance says the the policy decision of the Denver City Council is that future claims and future common interest communities should be preceded'",
        "'speaker_10': 'by majority consent. That you're imposing that as a requirement of city law. Right. But it does it doesn't prohibit or dictate one way or the other whether some other arrangement might be made by way of covenants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So you're saying that it is possible or it is not for a builder to require more than that? I'm just thrown by the at least a majority because we're setting a threshold, but not a ceiling.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I guess it's possible again, the first time I thought of that question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. This was confusion by the name of by someone who said that a builder had required maybe 80%. At one time. I thought, well, we're taking care of that. But when I saw this, at least I thought maybe we're not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But our intent clearly is that if you hit 51%, then it's valid, not higher. Okay. That is our intent. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our intent is Sky is saying yes. I'll accept that. I'm a little disappointed that that both sides in this issue pushed back on the right to repair. We've gone over that extensively already. So I don't want to re re plow that ground.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I am disappointed in it because I see the end game here as being taking care of a problem. And it seems we're doing everything we can to stand in the way of taking care of a problem as Jason perched on her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He just left.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He just left. Oh, Lord. Okay. I wanted to ask him, is there another realtor here still who can answer a question and follow up on? He had said that he can't he couldn't sell that firefighter's condo B, because the the association had filed a lawsuit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I wanted to know, could that have been different if the association were merely in arbitration because it's still a claim? Does that does arbitration affect the financial ability or sale ability of of the condo as opposed to being in litigation?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if you can answer that, could you come to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Microphone and come to Mike from.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In my experience, it does exactly to the same degree as litigation. Okay. They simply will not look at financing. I will also tell you that in our project, during the litigation process and in the two years subsequent, we have been selling and financing units and we helped people find sources of portfolio loans, not hard loans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Yeah, because it only affects some of the financing, not all of them. And then finally, regarding David, what you and I went over this on email, but I just wanted to get it out on the record. But regarding the provision, require majority consent of all unit owners in a case where a construction defect impacts only a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'few of the buildings I have a development in my district, for example, has about 30 separate buildings and where you might have a say, 500 units. I don't know the exact number, but if there were a defect that affected only three of those buildings at the low end and there's a drainage problem doesn't affect 27 of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'buildings. There's obviously not much of an incentive for the owners, as Councilman Lopez was getting at, to sign and intend to sue. And since we're codifying the finding of the Velasco case that if there's an arbitration clause, that's what you must use, you can't remove that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is there any way that this could be fashioned so that it's we're trying to steer people to arbitrate, to get to get settlements faster? Is there any way that this could be could consider an avenue that if you go to arbitration, then the board can do it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You don't need 51%. Would that change anything? Because I'm concerned about the ability of people who have a genuine issue in one or two buildings to be able to get consent from from 30 other buildings.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Certainly, it could have been written differently, but the mayor's proposal is very consciously designed to say the 51% is important, whether it's arbitration or litigation. And in fact, the last comment you just heard proves the point is that both going into either route for resolving a construction defect claim has serious implications for the entire community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so and so it's consciously written this way. And and that's the proposal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Mr. President, I think that's all I have right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Flynn. We're back. The council members are taking Espinosa for round two. I just have one quick question about the majority, David or Sky, any up? Are there any requirements currently in state law that require a majority?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because it seems that some council members are alluding to the fact that that's a huge threshold. So I'm just curious, in current state law, are there any mandates now for a majority, a majority of owners?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, the biggie is that in the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act, to amend the original covenants requires at least 50% and up to 67% of unit owners to do an amendment to the covenants as basically a concept that's hardwired into the law.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's the same thing where where you have to get you have to get to that number in order to achieve something very important. And and and, in fact, that's that's where a lot of the action has been in the courts and including some of the big reported decisions like the ISO is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is where an owner has tried to put an arbitration provision in the original covenants. And once a number enough of the units are sold off, then folks rally to collect up enough votes to take out the original arbitration clause by hitting that number.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. So, so, so that's the outstanding example in terms of where something like this already exists in the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act. But as I said earlier, there are lots of other kinds of laws that require you to hit a number 2 to 2, to take some significant economic action on behalf of a larger group.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Okay. Thank you. So this is that's not new. Thank you. I want to take you back up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have two questions. And the first one is a point that was raised by Liberty Lewis about holes in the code. She used an example about solar panels. I received something in writing that raised questions about, you know, misrepresentation, that there are certain kinds of environmental things included in a in the unit they're buying, but yet they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'find out later that those things were not included. So how do we address these issues where there are holes in the code? So, David, can you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. And hopefully I can say this briefly. I was listening very carefully to her comments as well. And let me just say that the language that talks about the code setting a minimum minimum standard for safe and sound construction, it's it's very it's very surgically written to to say what it says.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Therefore, any particular element.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Feature.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Component or other detail of an improvement or real property that is specifically regulated under the city codes and is constructed are installed in substantial compliance with the codes shall not be considered defective. Now, think about what that doesn't say.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If it's something about the construction that is not a detail that is specifically regulated under the codes, then people can bring to bear on whatever argument they want about what the safe and sound standard should have been for something that's not regulated under the code.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You understand? What I'm saying is that for things that are a gap, that aren't addressed in the codes this language doesn't speak to at all. So you make your argument that that is not addressed in the code. And here is externally from an industry standard or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What would have been the safer way to do it or the safest way to do it? If it's not addressed in the code, it's whatever creatively the plaintiff wants to argue about what the proper standard of care should have been.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. So the point being, this ordinance doesn't address that situation. Plaintiffs are free to make their claims. But if what they're claiming about is a detail that is specifically regulated under the code and it's installed in accordance with the code, then the builder can use that as a defense and avoid not having to pay on that claim'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let me move on. The point is, this was written to acknowledge there are some things that aren't regulated under the code that the parties will continue to argue about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my next question is, I'd like you to clarify that. My hope is that the focus is to try to cure the problem. And I'm not sure if. A person needs to go to arbitration in order to have a problem cured.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can you help clarify the the recourse or the route, if you will, or correcting a problem without having to, you know, file a claim, without having to, you know, go through a lengthy legal process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the short answer to that is, is provided by sadara by per by the state statute, which talks about the back and forth initial sharing of information to see if the parties can can amicably agree to fix something before having to proceed to either arbitration or litigation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That interplay is addressed in state law, and it's not disturbed in any way by this ordinance one way or the other.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I have no further questions at this time, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'David, is there language about the consequences of filing a claim that can be included as a provision under the required notice to the owners?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Could you repeat the question?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there language about about is there language about the consequences for filing a claim that can be included as a provision under the required notice to the owners. So the owners for filing. You know, to to go to the claim process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They are required to get notification 60 days prior. And we have a provision for you know, for. The provision is, where's that language? Now I lost it. The deck in the declaration. So there's a in the purchase agreement, we have a provision that has substantially, you know, takes the following form, and it's the actual language of what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we expect to be articulated. But if there are these actual consequences to the potential that are that are potentially dangerous in the interim, in the claim process, can we make sure that that people that are voting on on whether or not to go to a claim are actually made aware of what that potentially does, how it might'",
        "'speaker_4': 'encumber their property in a way that prevents them from selling, prevents them from refinancing, prevents them through the duration of that process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, the contents of the notice that are enumerated on page six and seven of the bill, I think include the issue that you're address and councilman, particularly on page seven. Number six, number six, the one component of the notice would be until the claim defective construction work is repaired or replaced or until the construction defect claim has'",
        "'speaker_10': 'concluded, the market value of the affected units will be adversely affected and it's also addressed somewhat in Southern as well. So take a look at six and seven and see if they adequately encompass what you are concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when do those get put put in front of the the buyer, the owner? Where am I at?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. This is a notice they have to receive before they they vote to give their assent. Okay. To to filing a claim.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry. Never mind. That answers the question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Good, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hey, Councilman Lopez, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. President, I think mine is more in line of a comment. All right, well, we will. We will.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Get you. Go ahead and chime in. You'll be first to go. Any other questions? 811 CNN public hearing is now closed. Comments. Councilman Lopez, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to really explore that question. I know this is first reading and we wanted to have this on first reading so we can hear from folks and then try to iron out our issues or any other pending questions before the final vote.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I my question remains this and I ran into it because we were trying to rename a street in West Denver and we were looking at as a lot of you know, we were successful in getting a majority of property owners along Morrison Road in favor of of changing it that says it's Chavez Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And although we got the majority over 64%, what the city required was 100% participation. So it was a no by an impossible yes. And having said that, we tried to track down every property owner we could and we couldn't find them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There were some folks we had to track down outside the country and we could never get their response. And because we could never get their response, we failed, even though we had 64% of the property owners along Morrison Road support it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what I'm trying to figure out if that if that's similar and if that applies, that's skip the road and think about a, you know, a highrise with condos right now. Is that 51% requiring 100%, 100% participation in what happens if if some people just do not respond, whether they want to pursue, you know, move forward with'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the lawsuit or lawsuit or not or or remedies or not. And I don't have a problem with the 51% required. And my question is the 51% of what I and that is what's what's hanging fire for me. You know, having been a labor organizer for for seven years and I, I would I'm going to spill the beans'",
        "'speaker_11': 'here. I liked arbitration. Because I knew I knew that if as long as we played fair and as long as that arbitrator was neutral, being that, as long as we as long with the other party were okay with a neutral arbitrator.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For the most part, we came out on top. As long as we played fair, as long as the the level the playing field was level and the rules were the same, those issues would be remedied. Now, I don't like seeing it tied up in courts.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't like the idea of of somebody who is in a project or is in a set of units, has a unit that cannot sell it or refi because it's held up in court. That's ridiculous. I don't like that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Part of affordable housing is preventing folks from losing their homes and that's being able to utilize that capital to utilize whatever tools they can to stay above water. Our market fluctuates. Those of us who were council members during the recession, we saw that property values, I mean, not even as customers, but we all saw that our property'",
        "'speaker_11': 'property values tanked. And then now they're at all time highs. I don't want to hold this up for the sake of that that question. Here's what I will say. I am not in the spirit of 100%. I am not 100% all the way there unless I get those questions, unless I feel I know that that's not a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'yes by an impossible no. But I say that right now. I know by an impossible yes. So I am I'm okay with moving this forward. But I'm not 100% on my final vote. I'm not just saying that to build a suspense is because truly that is an issue for me.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Knowing how hard it was to try to achieve that just on a street renaming in Denver where we had more than a simple majority. How hard will it be for unit owners to achieve that? And that 51% sure we're in the United States of America.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That sounds great, right? Majority. All of us are elected 50% plus one. Right. But imagine if they set the bar and said, well, you had to have so much participation from your district. So that that's just words. I'm I'm mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. For tonight I'm a little I'm a I'd like to get to 100% by next time, but they don't want to see status quo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is a little bit of making the sausage, but I think that's really the entire point of this whole of this whole ordinance is that is that it has to be a higher threshold, a higher bar to to sort of obligate the entire property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you really should have more than half of the owners involved in that decision, not just the minority share. And if you're not going to participate, yeah, you're a no vote until and but there's no time limit. They can keep going and keep going and keep going until they can get it, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's really the intent here is that we don't get a firefighter sort of stuck in a situation where he's been encumbered by a handful of people that were on the board. But my actual back to the six and seven items I would like to see if it couldn't be put to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not plain enough language back to the sort of who who's going to be reviewing this at the time it comes through. It says until the claim defective construction work is repaired or replace or until the construction defect claim is included concluded, the market value of the affected units will be adversely affected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's really not a question. I guess it's comment to my colleagues, which is that that sort of implies that, okay, go fix the problem and now you can sell your unit. But no, the claim is the legal process and you're tied up until that's concluded, which could be settlement, it could be repair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what is the conclusion? Angel You know, so I don't know if I got that, that language in a letter that informed me that this is something that the I mean, the the building is trying to do that you would know that you're actually encumbered.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And item seven then sort of gets into, in addition, certain federal underwriting standards or regulations prevent refinancing or obtaining new loans on projects where construction defect is claimed. In addition, certain lenders as a matter of policy, they don't actually it sort of doesn't still doesn't get to the sort of way that we look at products, you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'know, when we go to the to the bank and ask for this that other clause. The other provision to me is very, very clear in how it delineates what the issue is that I think could could confuse somebody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so where they think they might have an avenue to sort of correct and and move on if their if their building is tied up in an obligation. That said, I understand that the entire intent of the law is to not get to this point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree. I just leave the language as it is and hope that we never get there. But if we do get there, sure, it would be nice that it was clear what the heck you were doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm just thinking about some of the development that we have approved that have come before this body, where we're going to see multiple buildings built on sites like the Gates property, the Denver Post site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the point that Councilman Flynn raised about the threshold being at 51%, where everybody in the entire complex that's part of the highway has to you have to have 51% of everybody, but it's only one building that's been affected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd like to explore some language that really hones in on that one building, as opposed to everybody in the development having to sign on. You know, it ties up the other buildings and all of that stuff by requiring everybody else to weigh in when the reality is it's only affecting one building on the whole site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'd like to explore that with our city attorney between now and bringing the bill back for final reading so that we can, you know, try to correct that problem. We all know this is something that we've been needing to address for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We all would like to see for sale units. I don't know that that means we're going to see affordable. For sale units. I remember when we took a trip to Vancouver a number of years ago with the Denver Partnership and, you know, we all came back, everybody was excited about density.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, if we get density, we're going to see affordability. And that's not what we've been seeing in this city. We're seeing density, but they're not affordable even when we were building condos. And we know that, you know, apartment buildings are very costly now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, I mean, we are putting money into addressing affordability as a city. And, you know, it's a partnership between the city and our development community to address some of these challenges we have with, you know, part of our workforce that can't afford to live in the city and they have to move to the suburbs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At some point, you know, they're going to realize they can find the same kind of jobs, especially for so many that are working in the service industry where they live, as opposed to having to come into the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And at some point we're going to be struggle struggling, trying to ensure that we've got workers for our service industry. You know, so I mean, there's some challenges that that I think are inherent that we're we're trying to solve here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But in general, I think the need to get to a place where we can build for sale units is very important. I'm glad my colleague, Councilman Cashman, asked, you know, one of the builders if this language is actually going to make a difference in whether you all will start building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, I know the insurance plays a role in that and we don't know exactly what's going to happen with that. And, you know, my hope is that we don't go through all of this and we're like Lakewood and some of the other communities where there's still no for sale units being built.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm I'm supportive of moving this forward on first reading. Really want to explore the threshold issue, particularly where we have multiple buildings on a complex that, you know, just ties everybody up. So I'll stop at that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is this is an issue that I've read almost everything that has come our way from both sides. And and we know statistically, we know what the statistic shows about the market in Denver. I'd like to see some information about markets elsewhere in other cities to see if they're suffering the same dearth of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'condo construction as we are. But there's just something about this common interest community that seems to be attracting all this litigation that's not happening with single family homes or with other communities that are being built by the same builders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just as there are, there are examples of attorneys who are not ambulance chasers. There are examples of builders who are good quality builders. And so when I hear Build It Right the first time, I know that that's that sounds really good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do know that there are builders in this market who do build it right. There are good quality builders in this market. They'll build it right tomorrow. They'll build it right next year. They build it right last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they're not building right now. Whether this moves the needle or not is something we can't know. It's I feel a little bit like I'm throwing darts in a foggy in a smoky bar room, you know, am I going to hit the board?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is this the right thing? What other factors are at play? But I do know that as we've talked about financing and down payment requirements having been strengthened since the recession, well, that applies to all mortgages. That doesn't just apply to condos.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So why are we not seeing the condos being built? Those restrictions apply across the market. So there is something going on with common interest communities. Can this solve it? A lot of people think that it can that it can move the needle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was very hard for me to come down on where to where to vote tonight, let alone next week. But just this afternoon, after digesting everything, when it occurred to me that we do have builders that will build it right and they're not building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we need to find a way that helps clear the way to get shovels in the ground and start increasing our for sale supply of multi-family housing. So I'll support this tonight and hope to look more into the the arbitration issue before the final vote next week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Kasich.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to frame this issue, I think, in a. Or a way that maybe some have. I think the goal of tonight is about ensuring that individuals still have redress when there are wrongs in their properties.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it's creating more certainty and more clarity on the process so that the outcomes are a little more predictable. This entire realm of policy, as Councilman Cashman and I were talking about last week, is all about managing expectations and fears of risk.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. That's what insurers are doing when they set rates. That's what bankers are doing when they set insurance rates. That's what contractors are doing when they bid on jobs. And so we can't control this directly through public policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are just trying to create an environment where people feel like they are better at predicting risk and therefore don't overcharge. That's that's the goal. Well, no one's ever going to get a satisfactory answer on how much calculation of risk is going to change the game.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we are legislating in an uncertain environment, but it's one that I agree is necessary. After spending some time talking over several years ago, before the legislative process began with both sides, including mostly the attorneys and insurers, frankly, to cut through what sometimes is an overstated issue on both sides.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so that's my frame for what I think we're doing tonight and what we're aiming to do. And then the question is, are we doing it? So a couple of things in the language that I think are really important to point out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So first of all, where harms occur, there is redress here. And in particular, you know, folks have raised different concerns. But, you know, it's my understanding, you know, as as as a as a non-practicing attorney. But there's there is a strong case law regarding harm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it doesn't just mean, you know, that that, you know, you had a ton of property damage because a window leaked and you had to replace your carpeting. You know, the loss of value of your unit is a pretty, you know, clear area where you could argue harm if you're if your unit value is reduced, for example'",
        "'speaker_8': ', or your enjoyment, if you if you could never use your patio for some reason because it was flooded, those are all things that the common law generally recognizes as harm. So so where there is harm, there is redress in this in this approach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's really important. The next thing that I think is really important is that there is a provision that clearly states that if any arbitrator fails to follow the lives of Colorado with regard to construction defects, there's a redress in court.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think that's one thing that we haven't talked about enough up here, which is that this does not close your door to court. If you have an arbitrator doesn't follow the law as they're required to do, then you can go to court and you should go to court.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that path is there. And that's important for me. If it were not there, I would have maybe different feelings about the balance between these issues. Folks have talked about the right to cure. I would not have supported this ordinance if it had included a provision that allowed a builder to repair something without negotiating.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. That's that's not appropriate. What the current state law provides is a period of time for that discussion to occur. What arbitration creates is a framework for that discussion to occur. And that, in my mind, is important in retrieving the balance that we're looking for, saying that someone could come in and repair your unit even if you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'didn't agree that that was the needed repair. That's not a path I would have felt comfortable with. So I appreciate some of the restraint that the mayor has shown in this approach that I do think is quite balanced.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The last comment I want to make is a little bit of a of a of an in spite of which is that I do not believe that as long as we have buyers willing to pay $500,000 for condos, that the market is magically going to produce 250 or $300,000 condos in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so I think that demand is going to continue to determine pricing. But what I do know is that we have a policy framework in Denver that requires affordability in projects of 30 units or more. I'm not thrilled that some of the folks who asked me to vote for this ordinance tonight were up there asking us not'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to vote on inclusionary housing. And to me to link this argument to affordability while opposing that policy is is one that I'm not happy about. But just look at the prior vote. Just because I disagree with folks on one issue does not mean I cannot agree with them where they have the merits on their side.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I would not be able to support this ordinance if we did not have a framework for affordability that underlies it. So today, that framework is an inclusionary housing ordinance. We've proposed in the future that the framework would be an impact fee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I hope and I expect that the folks who've asked us to support this. Porting the new framework, should we propose one for affordability? And that means affordability to folks, you know, at below 80% of median income. That's not something this market is going to produce with or without this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so because we have a policy framework, though, that says when these projects are built, by definition, they'll be building affordability. I feel comfortable saying that it's in our best interests to produce more condos in Denver because I know there will be affordability.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So with that, I will be supporting it tonight. I want to just signal to some of my colleagues that I'm you know, there's a few tiny details that folks have brought up more clearly delineating that both parties have input into the arbitration selection process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I myself didn't go back and reference the state law in that clearly enough until tonight. So there's a few areas I would be open to. Not very many, but little tweaks like that that if they occur between first and second reading, I would be open to considering.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But fundamentally, I think this ordinance strikes the right balance for the reasons I've described, and I will be supporting it and urge my colleagues to do the same. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Kenney. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm with my friend, Councilman Lopez. I'm not there yet on a yes vote for next week. I think there's enough here that that I'll be looking to move it along tonight. We're doing two things right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I think Mr. Broadwell and the the administration has done a pretty commendable job at crafting something that may move our friends and the development community in a more positive direction towards building the condominiums that we need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not at all sure that it's fairly balanced in assuring homebuyers that they've got the full redress that they need. One thing I'd like to see, and I think Councilwoman Kinney's you alluded to it, but I'd love to see something in the language of arbitration that prevents some of the more onerous conditions that that we've heard have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'been written in to arbitration provisions. So with that said, like I say, I'll support moving it forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman, that's another your backup. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I am curious on what Councilwoman Ortega brought up on the buildings, because oftentimes certain projects will have different contractors working on different phases, different buildings. But I don't know how that works. Will it relative to banks, because they might look at it as a whole one project anyway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if one building is tied up. So I'd look to you guys for some clarity on that. I would also encourage us to maybe include some language that that the conclusion of the claim process be sent to all owners via certified means so that the you know, it doesn't become a problem for the buyer, for for the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'owner when they're moving on to something to have to track down a document that they really their banks are going to their lenders and stuff are going to need. And then I just wanted to say that, you know, there was a mention about affordable housing and accessible, primarily accessible housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we can get some public dollars into any one of those condo projects, that would hopefully get built by that virtue of that investment. Those are then have to be visible and accessible units per the fair housing requirements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so this is a heck of a lot easier sort of product type to get accessible units built into than these sort of townhome forms. You know, because these are ground forming, these are accessed by elevators there. And so I think it's actually an opportunity to actually get more accessible units easier, especially if we start to finance'",
        "'speaker_4': 'them with public money things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Any other comments? 811 CNN Madam Secretary, Roll Call Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I knew Ortega Sussman. Black Eye Clark. Espinosa. Flynn, I Gilmore. I Cashman. I can each. Hi, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Madam Secretary. Please cast Vali Nasr.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Results 12 Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_1': '12 Eyes 11 has been published and final consideration will be Monday, November 23rd. One pre German announcement Monday, December 14th will be a required public hearing on Council Bill 827, changing the zoning classification for 510 East 51st for 80 East for East 51st Avenue 4855 Perot Street 4871.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pearl Street 4877 Pearl Street. Any protests against Council Bill 827 must be filed with the council offices no later than Monday, December 7th. Same. The business before this body. We are adjourned.'",
