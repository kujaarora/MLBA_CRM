So no secret to anybody, unless you've been living under a rock or in a cave, that a year or so ago, the airport, with the approval of this council and the administration, entered into a very complex, important project renovating the great hall that went sideways, creating problems for the city, team travelers, etc. It's'",

And thank you, Councilman Cashman, for asking that important question. We often get that question as well, and I appreciate the opportunity to answer that fully.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So first, I would just like to say, you know, everyone's asking how is tomorrow going to be different than today? And I would tell you right here, right now, today is already different. In the past 90 days, we've accomplished more on this project than what has happened in the last year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To stand before you today with five contracts that we have done through a competitive selection process in just a short period of time, less than 90 days is a true testament to how quickly and how decisively we are moving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to also get to your question, we have also brought on additional resources such as Jacobs to assist on the program management side, to assist with us in keeping the projects moving and holding ourselves accountable, because at the end of the day, the buck stops with us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We acknowledge that and we own that. And we have looked very hard at ensuring that that happens as we move forward. We've also committed, as we talked with you in basic committee, about fuller transparency and what that means for the public and having a public facing dashboard where people can go on fly Denver dot com and see'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the status of the project. We think that level of accountability and openness with the public and transparency will assist with all of this as well. We're also incredibly customer focused. That was something that we want to make sure we continue to carry through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do know to your point that it is burdensome on the passengers and the public who travel through our airport. We want to make sure that they can get to their flights, go to see their families for the holidays in the best possible way possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Earlier this week, we started installing directional decals on the floor to show people how to get to ticketing, how to get to security. We're constantly looking for ways to make it easier for the public. So those are some of the things that we are doing currently to ensure that tomorrow is different from what has happened prior to'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. First, I think the the public should be aware that the principal reason for undertaking this in the first place is in the post-9-11 world to reconfigure the terminal that was never designed for the kind of environment that we're in today that we need to provide a much more safe, effective and efficient and secure'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And we have to adjust to that. And that's the principal reason this is being done. And to Echo Councilman Cashman is the principal reason that we need to get it under way as quickly as possible. Having said that, I share with a lot of the public the same sort of anxiety about whether this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The path forward that gets it done on budget and in less time. I have a lot of confidence in the companies that have been selected. And I would point out all those this will undermine what I just said.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll point out that this is a similar project management structure as that which was used to build the airport in the first place. So as long as we don't try to add an automated baggage system, we should be fine, perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think that going forward with this structure, it and still not knowing exactly what it's going to look like at the end of the day. I look forward to very soon when the next contract comes forward in early next year.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Exactly that, then we will be able to tell our constituents, here's what this will look like. But in the meantime, I believe it's essential, Mr. President, that we move forward with these contracts now so that we can fashion those details and get them before us sometime in January.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So a question for you. We talked I mentioned this in in Biz Committee, I. You as as an airport and as a as a management team have set the bar high for accountability and transparency. And you had a statement that you made about accountability and transparency that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Frankly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Made me not ask a whole bunch more questions. So do you recall that statement?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if you recall that statement, would you like me to repeat that? Yes, please. Okay. Absolutely. At this committee and it was a very great conversation, very thorough conversation by the members on that. I made the comment that we are committed to a level of transparency that the city has never seen before on a project of this'",

The question I want to ask is when? What is the timing? When do you all anticipate resolution of how much has to be paid out to the Great Hall Partners?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because that is key to the scope of work moving forward, because that then determines how much we have to scale the project back and we don't know what that figure is yet. So do you have a ballpark idea?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I so appreciate you asking this because we are working on that as quickly as possible. To your point, it's a very important piece of information that as we move forward, we want to know. So we are really trying to resolve that as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would love to have it wrapped up by the end of the year. But to be safe, we've told people that we were trying to get it done by Q1, but certainly as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To we anticipate that that will be resolved before we do the contract with the general contractor that you will be bringing forward to us next year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would hope to have that be the case, but we're not the only people in that environment to make that happen. And so there's a lot of, you know, it's complicated and so we're trying our best to get that done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The last thing I want to say is. I'm pleased that we have all these local contractors and local minority contractors that are now part of the project moving forward. Some of us wish this is how we would have done it from the very beginning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But, you know, it's it we are where we are. And I think you all are trying to be as diligent and efficient in trying to move the project forward. I know you couldn't do anything once the decision was made until the building was actually handed back to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which was last week, right? Correct. So now that we've got control of the space, it allows us to step in and do the that work that needs to happen. So I know these contracts tonight are key to moving the project forward, so thank you for having done the tour for many of us week before last to help'",
        "'speaker_6': 'us really see some of the challenges that were that were posed to the airport during that whole phase of trying to work with an outside company. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn, your backup.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thing, Mr. President, just stated. I should have added that as a member of this council who supported going forward with a three with the P3 back in 2017 and now being in a position of regretting that given the circumstances of what happened, I think it's very essential that before this Council is asked to support another P3 project'",
        "'speaker_7': ', even outside of the airport, that the airport produce a robust, not just a lessons learned, but about an autopsy, if you will, on what went wrong. And and I would hope that it would examine our faults as well and what we did and how we how we're improving that in this next round.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we'd really at least I think most members up here, probably all of us, need to have a very clear understanding of what happened. Before we will undertake this kind of venture again. I think that's important for many other projects in the city that that be produced.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would ask that that be undertaken. And again, not just the lessons learned, not just a you know, not a not just a 12 page report, but give us you know, let's let's air our laundry and let's find out what did we do wrong and how have we fix that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I appreciate that. If I can just respond to that for a second. And we had this conversation in Biz Committee, and we are certainly committed to making sure that the lessons that we learned are shared throughout the city family.'",

Beth, could you just explain, if you can, this level of detail on the revenues that the difference between the standard zone and the premium zone revenue next year, over this year, there's a there's a additional premium revenue goes away in 2020, and there's standard zone revenue is increased by almost the same amount.'",

What happened it so there's a standard zone which the treatment on the surface of the of the block is sort of minimum and there are trees and street trees and but there are not raised beds or benches, but there is lighting and some other amenities that are in the sidewalks'",
        "'speaker_3': ', in the premium zone. There are raised beds, there are benches and much more robust three dimensional treatment. And so it costs more to take care of those properties. And those properties actually are paying 75, roughly 75% of the cost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the standard properties are paying roughly roughly 25%.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And for those of you who don't know what we're talking about when we say the sign, it's the Cameron Motel is from the fifties and it's right on Evans and I, 25. And it has a very cool old neon sign.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be a nice neighborhood landmark.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. All right. I thought Councilman Cashman was up next, so I apologize. Councilman Kennedy, I'll get back to you. I don't know. We got a lot over there, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So anyone from the development team. So 1008 and 1009, which will be coming up next, are paired together. Was total acreage of the two plots. Total acreage is right around five and a half acres, five and a quarter acres.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And you said 150 units estimated on on this portion. How about on the on the other portion? On the other portion is about 360 units. Okay. So about 500 total units. Do you have any idea have you done any traffic studies as at this point looking at what your development would generate?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're still very early on in the site development plan process and building budget process. We have reached out to the relevant departments of the city and we are advancing those conversations. But to date we have not completed a traffic study, but we do anticipate it being a requirement of the STP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I'm just trying to envision, I believe one of the main access streets would be cherry. Is that correct? And let me ask my client, Cherry Street's Cherry Street Dead ends at a at the highway. Right. The main access point is off of Claremont, North Side.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And one of the things that we've discussed with the city and staff up until this point is ingress and egress off of Claremont and what the potential options of those are. While those have not been finalized at this point, we have been in discussions with city staff about what those options could be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I'm trying. Regardless of numbers of units or whatever, I'm trying to envision how you would turn left to go westbound on Evans out of that. I don't I don't think that would be possible. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The idea we envision is that you would actually get a bird such as a light protected light and take a left there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You you'd go over.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you would take Warren over to Birch north on Birch, and then take a left or west on Evans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Okay. Thank you very much. That's another question. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman, Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But thank you, Mr. President. I also have a question for the developers. You decide. Pick your favorite.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll take. We'll talk to you. Okay. So there are 150 units.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In this and this section in Bill 1008. Correct. Housing units under 50 on the North Parcel we're talking about now and 360 on the southern half. Okay. And 10% affordable housing as I. Right. So 15 on this, uh, this this parcel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's right. And 36 of the other. And will the affordable housing will there be on site four. Is that is it in this industry exclusionary affordable housing within the projects we're building? Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman each.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. I just kind of thought that maybe Melissa Teddy is the one to ask about this, but is there a parallel build, alternative plan or development agreement? So I just want to clarify. I heard that there is a good neighbor agreement and that the affordable housing is in there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that's we're not it's not in there. Oh, okay. So let's I just want to clarify which city, where, what the status of any city applications or agreements are regarding this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Melissa Tardy Department of Housing Stability. We have an executed development agreement which solidifies the affordable housing commitment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that development agreement is not being submitted to council because it doesn't meet the thresholds for council approval. Correct. Okay. So there are no vested rights in that development agreement then than that? Correct. Okay. And then can you just remind us again, even though when we have these units created at 80% of AMI our law and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'regarding source of income nondiscrimination in voucher holders, can you just talk about how it is that units at this level might be occupied by families who are lower income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For a deeper affordability or at the 80%?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, how they would how how a family with a voucher might might be a lower income than 80. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So various organizations, but especially the Denver Housing Authority, administers our housing choice vouchers, which are what we call tenant based vouchers. So they travel with the tenant. So, for example, a family who has a 0 to 30% AMI may carry a voucher with them to this project and could live in an 80% or below in my unit'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Additionally, there is a source of income, nondiscrimination or anti-discrimination ordinance which says that landlords cannot discriminate against tenants based on how they pay their rent. So if someone came with a voucher, that would need to be accepted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And can you just refresh us as a family at 30% of AMI, as a working family often, what is it that they're earning at that level.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And have to look it up? I pulled up the 80%. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's would it be fair to say they're like minimum wage workers in that range? Yes. Right. So these might be service workers. Yeah, it could be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, to single are two parents, both working full time minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Thank you. And then can I just speak to the developer team for just a second? So you have executed the development agreement, so there's a binding city ability to enforce. This is in lieu of your linkage fee payments?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm guessing so. And you're aware of the need to be nondiscriminatory in advertising these units and making them available?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And you will be operating these units, not just will you be developing and then maintaining ownership or you'll be selling?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is correct, that we don't know for how long or when, but the idea is to develop and operate it and also manage it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, then I would ask for your commitment to make sure that if you are passing on ownership of this, that you make sure that any buyers are on notice regarding Denver's laws and regarding I know that they're bound by the development agreement, but just making sure they're aware of the need to advertise nondiscrimination in their in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their in their advertising.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We certainly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will. Okay. Thank you. And your management company, I guess in some case, you probably won't be managing it. All right. All by yourself. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. All right. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing from counsel Bill 1008 is closed. Comments by members of Council Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to our neighborhood leaders. Thank you so much for coming down here and really for doing such an incredible job for your neighborhood. They have spent hundreds of hours working on this and advocating for their neighborhood and talking to a lot of different people who have a lot of different opinions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much for your leadership. And I also want to thank Chris Nevitt, who I didn't call up to ask. Questions of. But Chris Nevitt is our toddy director for the city and he was very much involved along with Scott Robinson on this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is in a very central location in Denver, directly across Evans from the Colorado Light Rail Station. And it is one of our goals in our city to direct density to our light rail station so that people will take the train and not drive their car.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so this is meeting one of those goals currently, that edge of the neighborhood, the edge of their neighborhood that's closest to Evan, has just a strange mishmash of random zoning that there's really no rhyme and reason to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Paul Cashman and I, I think as far back as 2015, met with our community planning and development director and staff, begging them for some kind of plan for this neighborhood because we predicted what was going to happen. And that is exactly what has happened is now there's lot homes and one really big apartment building that everyone hates'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and a lot of other stuff. And so it's really unfortunate that they did not listen to us, but I'm excited to say that this section of Evan's will be part of our next neighborhood planning initiative starting next summer, and that public works is working very hard to get an Evans Corridor study funded, so it will coordinate with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that neighborhood planning initiative. And then we are also working with Stantec to do sort of a mini neighborhood generated little neighborhood plan so that we can have some more weighty discussions with anybody else who who comes forward. So a couple of the big benefits to this program is the open space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Chris Nevitt and his team negotiated with them for that which was much needed. And believe it or not, in this part of town, we have Hollywood sidewalks and initially public works was just going to let them put in Hollywood sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But thanks to Chris, they are not. And so, yes, wow. Imagine that we're going to have real sidewalks. They can walk to a light rail station. So I'm very happy about that. And as I think everyone knows, earlier this year, the city purchased almost two acres for a neighborhood park, which was greatly needed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So good things are happening. We need to remain vigilant and we need to hold the developers accountable and make sure that the good neighbor agreement is enforced. I'm really excited. You're going to give people light rail passes. That is exactly the kind of thing we need to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So again, thank you to everyone. I will be supporting this. The final thing I'm going to say is to public works. We need to make these streets around the light rail station more safe and more walkable. Bucktown, Colorado Boulevard and Evans, they're not safe to walk across.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we need to keep on that. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. So I've had two concerns about this development, one being traffic, just knowing the area. They're having a hard time envisioning the access and the egress. The other concern that I have is and this is not particularly this development, it's how it's our approach to affordable housing period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think we can raise a flag over 10% affordable housing. It's not going to get us where we need to go. However. I believe the proposal meets the criteria that we're asked to assess. I have COBRA no precedence here supporting the development and I have nobody here raising their voice against it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll be supporting this this evening while maintaining those concerns and hope they're well addressed along the way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank all of you for all the work that you've done for this for this project. I also want to thank Councilwoman Black for her lifting up the replacement of Hollywood sidewalks for the sidewalks that people can actually use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to thank you for your commitment. You know, it's important for us as a city to to get beyond a car centric society. 75% of Denver ites commute to and from their work by single occupant vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's partly because 10% of Denver has no sidewalk at all. Another 30% of Denver has sidewalks narrower than four feet wide, like these Hollywood style sidewalks. So this is part of the part of that all hands on deck on you know, I mentioned climate change earlier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, helping us protect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our planet means that we need to get out of our cars. And and the way we do that is to make sure that we have the freedom to get from A to B and feel safe while doing it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for for being willing to to put in real sidewalks there and and to put in and to provide bus passes. Thank you, Honorable Nevitt for for all your work as well making sure that we that we continue to push this and so I will be supporting this this evening as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Kelso. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have to just second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Cashman's comments. I think that, you know, we have Arnaud.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Presidents here who are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Supporting this. And I think that that is fantastic. And without anyone here from the neighborhood who is speaking against it there, and it's clearly fitting into the criteria, there's really no reason for us not to support this. But I definitely don't think that 15 units is getting us anywhere near where we need to be with our affordability'",
        "'speaker_1': 'goals. And that is a shame because there's a real opportunity here, especially this close to transit, for us to really achieve some much needed affordable housing. So I just want to put that out there. And, you know, I wish that there were a way for us to achieve some.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To make a real dent in our affordable housing needs in this. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Counsel. I'm sure seeing no other comments on this item. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Black I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Flynn. I Gillmor. I Herndon. I Heintz. I Cashman. Kenny Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sandoval, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sawyer, I. Torres. Hi. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close the voting in the results.'",
        "'speaker_4': '12 hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': '12 hours counts. Bill 1008 has passed. Councilman Kennedy, will you please vote counts? Bill 1009 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Mr. President. This time I'm going to move that council bill 1910 zero nine, be placed on final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill 1009 is open. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you. Scott Robinson again with community planning and development. This is a request to rezone 21, 35 and 2175, South Cherry Street, 21, 76 South Claremont Street and 4501 Warren Avenue. From Jim, you three and PD to 77 to see Annex five again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The property is located in Council District four in the University Hills neighborhood and again just south west of I-25 and Evans Avenue and just south of the previous rezoning request. This property is about 1.3 acres and again requesting the rezoning to redevelop the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The existing zoning is GMU. Three and 277 with single unit zoning just to the south, CSX five to the north and east and GMU three to the west. The PD comes from the eighties and allows basically what is there now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The existing building and a fairly limited range of uses are allowed under the existing beauty. Property is also part of the Colorado Station General Development Plan from 28. Also in the secondary GDP area development area one, which calls for residential transition between intensive office development and lower density, uses south of Warren Heights generally 1 to 4 stories'",
        "'speaker_5': 'mixture of housing types. Also calls for that open space if development allows. And again, does not specifically allocate use height or density. And those can be changed without any amendment to the GDP. Existing uses are residential on the western portion and office on the eastern portion of predominant primarily residential, south and west and commercial north and east'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And again, you can see the subject property and some of the surrounding properties. This is subject to the same development agreement that has been signed by the city and the property owner, which again includes the voluntary affordable housing commitment of 10% of the units below 80%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ami for 99 years, 25% of those units, two bedrooms are larger and units that will be built as part of the first phase. The open space commitment for 30,000 total square feet with at least 20,000 square feet of that in one pocket park with an open space easement and the streetscape commitment to build the detached sidewalks with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the tree on. This also went to planning board on September 18th, received unanimous recommendation of approval. Two members of the public spoke and also in your packet is the letter of support from the University Hills North Community. With that signed Good Neighbor agreement in order to approve a rezoning of city must find that these five criteria have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'been met. The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans. There are four plans that apply to this property. First is Comprehensive Plan 2040. As described your staff report, staff has found the proposed rezoning consistent with these ten strategies from comp plan 2040 relating to equitable development, providing additional housing and affordable housing near transit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Providing additional open space. The second plan is Blueprint Denver from 2019. The context designation for this property is urban center consistent with the proposed Cn-Kcs five zone district. The future place designation is a community corridor which calls for a mix of office, commercial and residential uses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Heights generally up to eight storeys, which again is consistent with the proposed K'NEX five Zoning and Claremont. Cherry and Warren are all on designated local streets providing connections to Adams, the arterial to the north and east. The Collector to the south.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it is part of the community centers and corridors growth area intended to accommodate 25% of new housing and 20 20% of new jobs over the next 20 years. And there are additional strategies within Blueprint Denver that this proposal is consistent with relating to concentrating development around transit areas, providing affordable, affordable housing, providing additional open space, and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'bringing properties out of old code zoning and custom zoning. So bringing the pad into the Denver zoning code from 2010 is also consistent with the blueprint Denver so staff finds. The proposals are consistent with Blueprint Denver. The third plan is the Colorado Station General Development Plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The intent is to provide the transition from higher intensity long ovens to low intensity south of Warren. Again, heights generally up to four stories, but the GDP does not actually control height, and that can be changed without any amendment to the GDP.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we are getting the recommended open space. So staff finds the proposed rezoning generally consistent with the Colorado Station General Development Plan. And the final plan is housing an inclusive Denver, which again calls for providing more affordable housing throughout the city, which we are getting through the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So staff finds the first criterion met. The second criterion is uniformity of district regulations that finds the proposed rezoning would result in the uniform application of the CMC's five zone district. The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staff finds the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adopted plans and again providing that a pocket park in that mixed use development, creating a more walkable and healthier environment. The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff finds the proposed rezoning is justified by the change in changing conditions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are new development in the area, changing the character of the area to be more consistent with the proposed next five zoning and then also a portion of the site retains that old code. Former Chapter 59 Community Zoning sought to bring that into the new code is also a justifying circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The fifth criterion is consistency with neighborhood context, district purpose and intent. Staff finds the proposed rezoning would result in development consistent with the urban center neighborhood context, description and the purpose and intent statements of the CMC's five zone district, which is intended for areas or intersections served primarily by collector arterial streets where a building scale of 1'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to 5 storeys is desired. So again, Evans is an arterial just to the North Island. As a collector, just to the South City, the area served by arterials and collectors. And Blueprint Denver calls for heights generally up to eight storeys as a five stories here is appropriate staff finds all five criteria have been met and recommends approval'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I see three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People this time. I'm wondering if you guys are also going to talk on this one. No. All right, then it looks like we have three. First up, Jesse Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Jesse Parrish, represented for Denver Homicide at Low Black saw a movement for self-defense, positive action coming for social change as well as the upo universal African People's Organization and Unity Party of Denver. And I'll be your next mayor in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have the same questions. What is the guarantee that this is going to remain affordable at 80% AMI until 2118? And who is going to enforce this? The city is going to enforce this is to perpetuity. Do we have this all completely in writing?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to know for sure, for sure that this is going to be guaranteed affordable housing for the next 99 years. And also how many units? Because I'm confused. Is it 360 is a 350 and how many of those are actually going to be affordable?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. So what's the timeline for this? When will construction begin on this and when will it be completed? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Elizabeth Davis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks again. My name is Elizabeth Davis. I live at 2575 South Cherry Street, and I'm the co-president of the University Hills North Community Registered Neighborhood Organization. And I wanted to let you know that the board is in support of this request as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, contingent on the things captured in the Good Neighbor Agreement. And if it's okay, we'd like to request that the previous statement that we read be applied to this as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we need the statement to be ready in time?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kirsten Crawford Legislative Counsel I think it's fine just to put the written statement into the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Thank you. Jennifer new helping.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Same as with Liz Davis that what I read was the completion of the statement that Liz started. So I'd like to make sure that we'll give you a written statement for the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And do we did you email a copy of that statement over that we have? If not, could you just deliver it over to the our secretary over there? Thank you. All right. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have two questions for Mr. Hill, if you wouldn't mind coming back up. So, I mean, you guys are the same developer on this site as well? That's correct. So has the Good Neighbor agreement been signed between both parties?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It has. Yes. This is Chase Hill with Cypress Field Advisors. And both the good neighbor agreement and the development agreement have been fully executed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then do you all intend to apply for low income tax credits for either one or both of the projects?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Currently, we're not intending to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're not intending to. So the only affordable is are the ones that are already spelled out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That 10% of inclusionary affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Scott.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Could you explain a little more, first of all, how many units are on this site? And then how did we arrive at 10%? Because this close to a transit station, I would think that we would try to leverage more affordable units and deeply affordable units than ten, just 10%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So the my understanding from the developers is they plan about 360 units on this site. They can talk more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'About as opposed to the other one, which was 100. 150. Yeah. Okay. Three. How many?'",
        "'speaker_5': '360 is.'",
        "'speaker_7': '-60. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the the amount came through negotiations with the developer. And again, this is entirely voluntary on their part. We have no requirement that they provide affordable housing, just that they pay the linkage fee. Right. And so this is more than what the the linkage fee built out alternative would have resulted if they had just decided to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'build. What would.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Been? I don't know. Off the top of my head, we can do the calculation. Okay. But I know I know we are getting more than we would have under just the the like actually build alternative. And so it was a series of negotiations over months with the developers over what they could give and still make the project'",
        "'speaker_5': 'work for them. And you're right, we always want more affordable housing, deeper affordability, longer times, larger units, all those things. So they were all in play and this was the the deal we could get.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How did we arrive at 25% of them being two bedroom as opposed to one? Are the others one bedroom or are they studio or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the way that a good neighbor agreement and a developing agreement is drafted is that it's proportional to our unit mix for the market rate units. And it's currently contemplated that 25% of our market rate units will be two bedrooms above the remaining 75%, 60 or one bedrooms, 25 or 15 or studios.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the development team. If you could come up to the mic, can you talk to us? Can you talk to us about that, the the right of way that you're vacating?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I asked this question in ludi, but I just want to make sure that it gets on the public record because right now, ingress and egress on ingress and egress on cherry seems super challenging. And your rezoning from an approved new zoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So can you just talk to me about where you are in that process and where you are in this site development process?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you. That's a great question. So we have now officially vacated Cherry Street as of two weeks ago. So the section of Cherry Street that bifurcates our site into two east west halves has now been fully vacated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Cherry, she will stop at war. And then we are introducing a new east west private road that will split our site north south that is actually in the GDP plan to eventually have those east west roads. So we're kind of the first domino in that plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that road will also allow access out of our property over to Claremont. And we have a second point of entry which is wanting the neighborhood wanted out of our project under Warren. So you can access you can get out of our garage to the north of the new east west road or to the south along Warren'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And talk to me about the when you vacate, will you have sidewalks on the front going east west now or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So the new private street, which it's not going to be the city right away, it's private road that bifurcates are phase one and phase two. We're talking about phase one currently. That is merely basically a fire lane for primitive fire access.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The sidewalks, which are detached sidewalks, not the Hollywood sidewalks, are running along Claremont and Warren.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Perfect. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. May I ask Mr. Robinson to come up? The developers are really kind to stand there. So the question that I have so we had a couple of concerns about the percentage of affordable housing in the last the last rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And your comment just a minute ago is we have no requirement for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I think I know the answer to this, but just to the public knows, can you explain why we don't have a requirement for affordable housing yet? We clearly have a need for affordable housing. Yes. So what we have is what's called a linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we my understanding is we went with the linkage fee and replaced our formerly former inclusionary housing ordinance because we could not require of inclusionary housing. We could not require developers to build units when those units were rental because of state law and state Supreme Court decisions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So under current state law, we can't require a developer to provide affordable housing as part of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rental project. And so we have the linkage fee instead, which does not actually require developers to build any affordable housing units. And does that court decision, this state Supreme Court decision, have a particular name or the it's known as the Telluride decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. All right. See no other questions. Public hearing for accountable 1009 is closed. Comments by members of Council Council Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I don't have much to add other than to just clarify that there are. If they build what they are proposing to build, there will be at least 50 units of affordable housing, which is far better than paying the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just wanted to clarify that and also just to personally make the pledge that I will make sure that they comply with the development agreement and the good neighbor agreement. Personally, I've lived in near there almost my entire life, and so it's very important to me and to my constituents who are in the back of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'room. So I will make sure as I am able to hold them accountable. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Joyce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Thank you so much. Just wanted to mention piggybacking on Councilwoman Greenwich's comments about voucher holders being able to access these particular properties at 80%, but still only paying 30%. It's a it's particularly important because not even a year ago, a lot of voucher holders were leaving Denver with their voucher because they couldn't find those units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate you including 80%. And we just want to make sure that those voucher holders are aware of what they qualify for. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Torres. See no other comments. I'll just add again a thank you to staff for all your hard work on this. Putting together the report today and the staff report in our packets, I think it clearly demonstrates that this meets the criteria and I'll be voting yes this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Black I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Flynn I.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Sawyer I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Torres, I. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, Madam Secretary. Please. Before the voting announced results.'",
        "'speaker_4': '12 hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': '12 hours. Council Bill 1009 has passed.
