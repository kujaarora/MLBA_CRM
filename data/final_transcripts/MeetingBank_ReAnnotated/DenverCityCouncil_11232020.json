        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. We have Councilman Flynn. You're up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to point out that under the charter, 7.2.1, this annual appropriations ordinance must be passed. It's our role here is similar to today, what we witnessed in Michigan with the state board of canvassers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is the annual appropriation ordinance that fills in the budget that was passed last month. And there have been times when I have voted against the budget, but once it is passed, it has to be appropriated. So I urge my colleagues to vote yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I have two specific questions and I'm sorry I didn't give the agencies a head up. I wasn't planning to call this out, but then when I saw it was called out, I wanted to ask the questions. There are two items in the long bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One is the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment is. Allocating. It's $1.6 million. And I was it's it's for the relocation of the medical examiner's office. And it wasn't that long ago that they relocated to a site that used to be on the Denver Health campus, and they're now just south of Sixth Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I wasn't aware that they were moving again. So can you talk a little bit, Will, about what's going on with the medical examiner's office?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Here's. Here's what I'll say about about that office. I mean, you know, to be true. Just from seeing kind of monthly reports from Dr. Jim Caruso, the medical examiner, we you know, throughout the year, this year, we've seen an increase in, you know, all types of deaths and their their office because of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the nature of the work, because of the medical certifications and the different folks that they're required to hire. They've had a hard time kind of attracting and, you know, and keeping the best folks. And they they do they do put a lot of effort into hiring the right people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what I know is that what I know is that their office, not just this year but has seen a large increase in their work volume.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am not aware of of the strategy and how that all played out. And I'll just tell you that candidly. But I can tell you honestly that. You know, even though my my colleagues from other divisions would would frown on me for saying this, that office is I won't say overworked, but they do they do a ton'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of really important stuff. And I know this doesn't address your your question directly as far as how that all came about. But what I can tell you is that there, you know, I've seen just recalling now I've seen pictures from inside of the facility, the kind of state of the art stuff that they have now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know that they had some of the support that they always that that they needed and now they do if that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So I guess my question is specific to the million $645,080 that is listed in the long bill that says it's for the Office of Medical Examiners relocation. So I don't know if that cost that applied towards that when it was relocated or if it if that's regarding a new relocation, because it wasn't that long ago they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'had a big grand opening. We all walked through the facility, got to see, you know, all of what this new facility. And it's much, much larger than the old one when they were in the basement down on Bannock Street on the Denver Health campus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's what I'm trying to understand here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we can only have Stephanie Adams that we wanted to bring up into the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would be great here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we'll go ahead and. Get Stephanie into the queue to answer this question. And let me see. Stephanie. Yeah. Stephanie. If you could raise your hand in the attendees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. There you go. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Hi, everyone. So canceling our ticket, they are not relocating again. I think that that that is actually a capital a capital allocation. So let me talk I will talk to my friends and keep it. My hunch is that the annual cost of that, it's those costs of the relocation and we happened to name it that India'",
        "'speaker_1': 'should probably revisit that particular name. Okay. That's helpful clarification. Thank you for that. Of course, you may be want to stay on for my next question. And this one is regarding wastewater management came in under wastewater management, there is a cost of $300,000 for public restrooms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why is water management paying for restrooms? Typically, that would be a public works cost. It would be a Parks and rec cost. It's not normal that that is a wastewater management cost and it's helpful to know where those are proposed to be as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly. So again, I believe that the capital cost is actually been on the books for the last two or three years. They've had an allocation associated with public restrooms and I know that they had worked with that was sort of that roaming restroom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You knew how they had the restroom that was going through the city that was actually paid for by wastewater. And I do know that they have been working with parks in particular to understand how they could leverage those dollars for additional restrooms or enhancing restrooms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll find out exactly what the current plan is for 2021. But that actually has been a cost that that wastewater had ALEC has allocated for the last couple of years. Okay. And this is actually for the is that because they want to make sure that we don't keep stretching what we asked the Wastewater Enterprise Fund to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cover if they're not allowable expenses. And given the bill that was on the ballot, you know, that was a statewide bill that dealt with the creation of a special. Special funds. Enterprise funds. I want to make sure that we continue to do everything we can to protect this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We all know that the need for restrooms is important. I don't want to minimize that by any means, but I want to make sure we protect that in a fund and not get ourselves in a situation where we jeopardize that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's why I brought it. Certainly council and I'm I'm very sure that we cleared that with the city attorney's office before we would have done that a couple of years ago. But I will I will follow up with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just to clarify as well, and actually, I did receive a text that that particular allotment is for the second downtown restroom. Okay. All right. Thank you. Of course. All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman PANITCH.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I just wanted to chime in on this discussion. My colleague, Councilman Ortega, was having I was involved in this discussion with our former director, Jose Cornejo. And the reason for this source for the restroom funding is because when there is public urination and defecation, that those things end up in our inner storm water sewers and they'",
        "'speaker_0': 'end up in our rivers, and it ends up as part of a water quality issue. And so public restrooms are a mitigating factor to that, particularly, you know, risky environmental issue. And so so so that's the nexus with the fund and the reason why those dollars were dedicated quite some time ago as a partial cost, not for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the entire I think it was at one point a 5050 cost sharing. So if that context is helpful to my colleague, just wanted to share that. Thank you.'",

Our company's focus on community has driven our work on this project, and because of that, we began our engagement efforts over 15 months ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From the beginning, it was important for us to get early input and feedback and the community's vision for this property. We held six meetings with the registered neighborhood organization before even submitting our zoning application and then a number of individual conversations with our members throughout this process.'",

We've also dedicated all of our three bedroom units to be affordable. The proposed zoning will create conditions that can benefit the community in a variety of ways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Early on, the neighborhood organization told us that this property is viewed as a gateway to the neighborhood in the art district. The new zoning request will help us achieve the vision of the piano as follows. The proposed zoning creates an opportunity for transit oriented projects across the complex light rail station.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The new zoning will allow for live work units where an owner can operate a business on the ground floor while living upstairs, decreasing the expense of operating a small business. The proposed zoning requires street level activation along the Colfax frontage, allowing for a variety of users, including restaurants or businesses that serve the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With the proposed zoning. Opus will partner with the art district on Santa Fe. To assist with art curation and public art features surrounding the property. Finally, the rezoning will create conditions to support a great new project that will offer improvements in the alley, new sidewalks, utility upgrades, pedestrian plaza and added greenspace.'",

I was asked by the applicant team to specifically touch on the issue of plant support, and we appreciate Mr. Shavers analysis on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll be brief. The proposal will allow for revitalization of an auto oriented, low density intersection and to a much more walkable area that takes advantage of transit access. So in that way, the proposal furthers many of the big picture themes of Blueprint in the Allman Lincoln Park neighborhood plan, including providing access to opportunity, creating affordable housing'",
        "'speaker_4': ', establishing conditions to support community oriented businesses, provides mode shift away from cars and towards other forms of transportation, and it provides efficiency in land use and development. Since Brandon provided greater detail on planning guidance, I won't reiterate what's already been said, but we do believe the proposal is most appropriately reviewed under the urban center and neighborhood context'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and that the future places guidance supports the building height at seven stories along Colfax and scaling down to the south. With respect to the comparison to the existing zoning, the rezoning advances several aspects of planning guidance and brings the property integrator conformance with the plans when compared to the existing zoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The building height will remain the same as currently entitled in the CM x eight with waivers portion of the site and the zone change will allow for relief from the current are limitation, which makes for less site, less efficient site development and avoids the possibility for surface parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It maintains protected district upper storey setbacks and reduces height in the CM x five portion of the property, and it will require activation through transparency and street level active uses. So with that, we believe the request is consistent with planning guidance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We agree with staff's analysis. We'd be happy to take questions or discuss this further. We certainly respectfully request your approval. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Jay Fournier. Go ahead, J.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. My name is. My name is Jay Fournier. I'm also with the Opus Group. I am here to answer questions on the design architect on the project, working with Joe and Brian. I don't have anything formally to request but just offer my mind if you have any questions regarding the architectural design and the urban planning of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Jay. And our last speaker on this hearing is Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The new members of council cannot be heard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Jefferson Parish, a representative for Denver homicide. Wow. Blackstock, someone with the self defense, has a passion for social change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile High Schools. And I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was with me not in approval of this rezoning. I figured it was going to be more gentrification than usual. This area town has been gentrified, such as other areas of town, the Westside as well. I wanted to know I had a few questions for the occupants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If. You are going to plan on keeping the existing restaurants and retail establishments along with the laundromat. I also wanted to know why only 10% of units are going to be affordable for 99 years. Also, we wanted to know why the army levels are so high since you're talking about affordability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is this affordable for 60% to 80%? Army is not affordable. Especially when an average annual income in Denver is about $55,000 a year. So. I say that the occupiers did their research better outreach. They reached out to the Arnolds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They reached out to several neighborhood groups. I seen there was one letter of concern. I wanted to know what that letter of concern was. I want to know what the letter of opposition was. And also I want to know what is the guarantee of this actually being affordable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You said that you came out with a neighborhood a neighborhood agreement. Who is going to enforce this agreement for 99 years? And also how many portable units. Is it going to be more than 28? Or is that just the total that's going to be affordable?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How many units in total are going to be at this property? And honestly, it's it's got to be next year. This is going to be residential commercial all the above. So a please answer those questions. I will greatly appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Jesse. And that concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Build 1086. Councilwoman Torres. Thank you, Madam President. Brandon, my first two questions are for you on the justifying circumstances. You mentioned that public and private investment along the Santa Fe corridor were one of the things that allowed this to go to higher'",
        "'speaker_2': 'heights or meet some of the criteria. Can you just give me a sample of what those investments were that qualified for you in your in your analysis?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, definitely. So staff looked at recent development that has occurred along Santa Fe since 2010 when the neighborhood plan was adopted. So I think in the application, they specifically call out a mixed use building that's under construction right now along Santa Fe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They also talked about another project that is at Colfax in Osage that just recently opened. And then the public improvements, I believe, are still underway. But there is a project underway by Daddy to make Santa Fe Corridor a quieter sidewalks and public art components to make it more of a walkable place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that staff thought that increasing the height and the density at this location was in going with the neighborhood is changing and was a satisfying, justifying circumstance. Hey.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Parking minimums here. Can you tell me a little bit more about how how you look at what kind of parking is required here, given either whatever arrangement is made, the type of zoning that it has and its proximity to transit infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yep, that's a great question as well. I do not know off the top of my head what the parking requirements are for the C-Max and. It depends on if it's for residential or if it's for a commercial use.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can get back to you on that. And then there's also a parking reduction for being in close proximity to the rail station. So I believe that they.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did get a reduction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Brendan. Andrew, question for you at Host.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you can give me a little bit more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Information in the in the public about the development agreement that was struck.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. We worked with the there's a voluntary, affordable housing agreement that has been struck on this property. It will be in place, as they've talked about it already for 99 years. It takes a total of the 280 units that are anticipated at this particular time and would say 10% of those would be creating 28 units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is intended to be. There's a for sale clause and there's a rental clause. But the rental is will generate about 25 units at 80% AMI and about three units at 60% AMI. As we were going through the negotiating process, when we looked at the neighborhood and what we were looking for here was really also trying to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get larger family units. So we were looking at things with like three bedrooms. We actually were able to come to an agreement that all of the three bedroom units in this project would be affordable. So there's we they did go the extra mile to actually get a larger family units in this in this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So did you have any other questions?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You mentioned a for sale clause. What does that mean for affordability?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it provides an option. So if you have a rental, if you if the project's all for rent, then it would be everything would be 80 and 60% AMI. But if they operate for sale, then it would be actually it's the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's 80. It's sorry. It's sometimes are different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Andrea. And then my final questions are for the applicant, Joe or Brian. So several of the businesses in the retail area have closed. I've noticed recently, but I know the restaurant remains. There might be some others.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have you been has there been conversation with any of the businesses that have remained about continuing on with the project? What does that look like so far? I know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's throwing a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wrench and everything, but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, COVID has affected some of the local businesses there. Um, I know the Starbucks, um, the two other businesses are planning to leave. Um, and we worked actually hand in hand with the laundromat to kind of figure out how to relocate them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Um, so we've come to agreement with them. Um, part of our purchase agreement that doesn't allow us to speak with the tenants directly as we have, we've had to go through the landlord. But the project is designed where we can bring back these local tenants, um, and keep them in the project if necessary and if they want'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to stay a part of our outreach engagement. Over the last 15 months, we met with Irene Aguilar and asked them through our programs to try and help out with a time in between when construction starts and when the building would be open for these retailers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we hope this is committed to really help these tenants and act as a liaison between the tenants and to try to figure out a way to make that work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's helpful. So Andrew gave a little bit of a rundown of the development agreement, and I remember in committee it was clarified that you can designate the affordable units for a certain population. I think my question was, how do you make sure that it's not students, that it really is families and not a set of roommates that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'might be occupying the three bedroom?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How would that actually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Work in your in your.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'View?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So, first of all, we're renting by the unit and not by the bed. And that is typically a natural deterrent to students. You know, they're looking for, you know, to rent a bed and not be held accountable for an entire unit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also we rent on a 12 month rental cycle, and it's not based on the academic calendar. It's also my understanding that their housing policy allows us to cater towards that family, and that's what we intend to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. On the art curation, I know that you and I saw the letter from the district. Thank you for working with them. What does that look like? Does that look like art shown in the lobby or. I thought I remembered artist studios being discussed at one point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What's the what's the plan for this one?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So we have a few options. I think first off, we have an opportunity and the right of way on the sidewalks that have some type of sculptures and some type of, uh, a pedestal to really make this feel like a gateway to the art district on Santa Fe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also have the opportunity to have the assistance from the district and art and are united spaces in the building. And I think the kind of the best option is on the east side of the projects are the proposed project along Kalama.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a co-working space where it would be floor to ceiling glass and the idea would be like a first Friday. Or if there's some kind of event that the artist from Santa Fe is hosting, that we could have a gallery space there, that a local artist could have their work shown and leave it there for, you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'know, 2 to 3 month period or whatever would be appropriate for that artist.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. And then on the actual development that the build, one of the big pain points of this particular corridor has been the sidewalk along Colfax. And Councilman Hines might remember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we were.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First sworn in, a constituent from downtown who uses a wheelchair to get around, made sure that it was on both of our radar, that he can't use this this particular sidewalk, the utility infrastructure is directly in the middle of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you give us a sense of what you envision that looking like for pedestrians, for for for access?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So part of this site development plan process, we worked with the city and we're basically dedicating the first 20 feet between the building and Colfax Avenue as public right away. So that would be an extended sidewalk as well as a tree line.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then we are upgrading all the sidewalks along the Pan Alley map. And then another thing of note is that obviously we bring on an accessibility consultant to make sure not only the public right away is accessible, but also within the building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Those are my questions, Madam President. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Torres. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. Joe, if you could just stay on. I've got a few questions for you as well. First of all, did you guys try to acquire the property to the south of the lodge?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. That has historically been city owned property. That's where the Community Development Agency used to be before it was CPD and now Dido. And I had asked our planning director some time ago about planning director, but our Dido director to look at that property and tell us what was the status of it, because it has been vacant'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for years and years and years and it's an eyesore on our community and it would have been ideal to incorporate into the development. But so that's why I was asking the question whether or not you guys even looked at that, because it will continue to be an eyesore on your property once it's all said and done, if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it continues to remain vacant as it is today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, yeah. There's there's currently a single owner on the property that we're rezoning and we never consider that piece of land to the south. Yeah, it could have been a good opportunity, though. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It could be. But anyway, so my next question, some several of them were asked by Councilwoman Torres. As far as the it is, is this being done in partnership with new said or did you guys purchased the property from them?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sunnyside actually sold this property to the current owner, I think it was in 2005. Okay. The new set is no longer part of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Got it. All right. That's good to know. I guess it's. I don't know. I lost track of that back then. Didn't realize that happened. That Fargo. I want to know if you guys have done a traffic study and if that's going to warrant anything new or different with that many units being put on the property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And can you give us an idea of roughly based on the commercial square footage that you're looking at and the residential? How many cars will be on the site?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So we haven't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Had a significant reduction because of its proximity to rail. But you're not going to build a project without some parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So the code requires us to have 0.75 stalls per unit. We're currently designing at that point nine stalls per unit with retail spaces as well. We haven't yet done a traffic study, but that would be a part of the site development plan process as we get into that further.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We submitted our initial plans in October and we're expecting comments here hopefully in the next 2 to 3 weeks. And at that point, we'll have to engage in a traffic study in the current retail on the site, I think there's about 15,000 feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we'll have 10,000 feet of traditional retail and then six live work units. And those are about 1500 square feet each.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When you say traditional, you think in a restaurant, some of the neighborhood serving kinds of businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So the way it's designed on the northeast corner, that could be a restaurant like a sit down restaurant and that's about 3000 feet. And then the Inland Retail to be able to pan kind of mid-block along Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's going to be very flexible where it could be a sit down restaurant or it could be some type of a drop off laundromat. Really could be anything.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so have you all begun talking to see about whether or not you're going to be pursuing any kind of curb cut off of Colfax?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're actually going to be removing the existing curb cut, and that does require commitment, see done. Um, and so as soon as we get these initial comments back from the step process that will allow us to begin the civil designed documents to engage, see that and start that process just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that typically you're not going to have a curb cut on Colfax, is that right? You're just going to have a calendar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll have one access point, lots of columns, one off of the pan, and then we also have an access point. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So good. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. That's helpful to know. I appreciate that. Let me move through. I've got a few more, if you don't mind. Madam President. We already talked about the parking reduction number of parking spaces the city owned lot. Curb cut.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Traffic study. I think. Can you tell us whether or not you're looking at securing any lower income tax credits for the project?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, we are not. Yeah. The really the only benefit that we are looking for, this is the extra height in zoning. So it will not be asking for any other assistance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right. Those are my questions. Thank you much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Next up, we have Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to thank Councilmember Torres for bringing up the point about access on Colfax. I also want to thank the applicant for, I think you said, 20 feet of right away. Wow. So I use a wheelchair for mobility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I add after customer returns brought up the lack of access. I have tweeted about that location to and from from where I live to go over the metro. I would go along this area and I would go in the in the in the parking lot because there was no way for me to get between the rock obstruction'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the trees. And so I want to thank you for your commitment to pedestrian access. Colfax, obviously, is a huge transit corridor, perhaps the busiest in the city. I don't I don't know. I haven't looked at the data, but at least for pedestrians and and mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to thank you for for considering the pedestrian access in that and that large sidewalk access. I think that that will really help you with with encouraging people to to live, work and play there and and use whatever businesses in the immediate area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just wanted to throw that coming up. Thank you and thank you, councilmember attorneys for bringing that up. And thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Hines. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1086 is closed. Councilmember Torres. Would you like to make any comments since it's in your council district? Thank you so much. This was your group was actually one of the first two that I met with about this particular property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I know that you've been working on it for a very long time and appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Measures that have been taken to make sure that different partners within that neighborhood felt really good about the project, that community members felt like it was reflective of llama Lincoln Park. And I hope I would love for that to continue, not just with the art district, but with that community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's very much an established and historical Chicano neighborhood that's deeply reflected in the art and in the culture surrounding that. It's also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Highly mobile. And I love the access that you're granting, particularly at Colfax, as we were discussing. But also, I think the what I'm hoping will be the transparency of the building. I remember a hotel, small hotel, boutique hotel that I visited in Louisville, Kentucky, where their lobby is effectively a a a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gallery.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And an artist studio for the public. And it just made it a really unique space that you don't see too often, especially as you get into the downtown corridor. So I just want to thank all of the partners that have been involved in this and have done it so deeply.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know this is a project that Susan Stanton was working on, and it was just really a pleasure to be able to to work with her for such a short period of time. And knowing that she had been involved and was involved when we first met, it did breathe an air of confidence of process into this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'project and I think that has shown through. And just thank you for all the work that you've done. And I'm looking forward to the build and I hope my fellow council members will join me in supporting it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Up next, we have help from Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to echo what Councilman Tory says. I was working in Councilwoman Montero's office in 2012, 2013, when we did the study, pedestrian study and access along Colfax there. And we had talked about the redevelopment of this site and here it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, I'm a council person being able to vote on it, so it's pretty cool. And in season Stanton's memory, I remember being elected and she called me and talked to me about this site and how excited she was about it and the affordability and what were my thoughts about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And um, even though she's not with us today, her legacy still lives on through all of these buildings. And I miss talking to her and going over things with her. And she would be sitting here with us tonight, surely proud of all the hard work that we need to do so in her honor and her memory.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thank you, Councilman, for bringing that up, because she's been it's been this degree of loss to the families community with through this year. With that, I will also be supporting it this evening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Sandoval. And and thank you both for bringing up Susan's memory. She is definitely near and dear and had her networks all over the city, if not the region. And so I'm happy to support this tonight as it meets all of the criteria.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It has been moved and seconded by Councilman Holmes. The required public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1127 is open. May we please have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Can you hear me and see my screen? Okay. Awesome. And so my name is Libby Adams, and I'll be presenting the MAP Amendment at 26, 55 and 2659 Downing Street. This application is located in Council District nine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the Five Points neighborhood. The property is located on the corner of Downing Street and Fremont Place. Its approximately 8080 square feet and is currently occupied by an industrial warehouse in a single unit home. It's currently in the general urban residential office, three zone district and the applicant is proposing to rezone to urban mixed use three stories'",
        "'speaker_0': '. As stated previously, the existing zoning is a grocery which is a multi-unit, residential and office district, allowing the urban house, duplex, townhouse and apartment primary building forms. The maximum height allowed is three stories or 35 to 40 feet, depending on the primary building form.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The site is currently occupied by an industrial warehouse and a single unit home. As mentioned, it's surrounded by mostly other residential uses with more commercial closer to the Welton corridor. This shows the existing building form and scale. The subject site is on the bottom.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And you can see there's some new townhomes across Fremont Place. Some existing row homes just to the northwest. And then a duplex directly north of the site. The MAP amendment was complete at the beginning of May, and a postcard notifying property owners within 200 feet of the site was sent out on May six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This was originally scheduled for planning board in mid-September, but one of the neighboring property owners actually noticed that it was noticed to the incorrect council district. So this was a notice to Councilmember Cashman instead of Councilwoman CdeBaca. So then it was pushed back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the public hearing for planning board was held on September 30th once that new notice had been sent out 15 days prior and they unanimously recommended approval. We did receive five public comments about this case and three were emails in support of the proposal, the proposed rezoning, and then two were emails from neighboring property owners requesting'",
        "'speaker_0': 'more information. One wanted to know about parking and which would be determined at the time of the site development plan. And then the other. They wanted some assurances that this would include some commercial development and not just be residential.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are five review criteria in the Denver zoning code, which I'll go over. The first criterion is consistency, adapt the plans, and there are three that are applicable to this site. The rezoning is consistent with several of the strategies and comprehensive plan 2040, but I'll just go over a few of them.'",

I'm a product of the Denver public schools and I'm this I graduate the proudest I graduate, I should say. I currently live in the park neighborhood of Denver with my sons, who are also attending Denver public schools.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I chose to become a paramedic, and I joined Denver Health in 2000. And it was really my opportunity to give back and to be a part of this community in a different way. And really, Denver health affords that opportunity in many ways for paramedics to contribute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, speaking of the contribution, the Denver health paramedics were on more than 130,000 calls per year for service. It's definitely the largest emergency medical services system in the state and certainly in the region. And running such a service comes with a lot of challenges.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think that we manage these challenges well and we find ways to help people, and we find ways to help beyond just the response of the paramedics. We actually in the last two years, we've trained people in CPR.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First aid stopped the bleed, over 7000 people in the last two years in these courses. We've also trained over 550 EMTs and paramedics in the last three years. And so the impact of this health care education and it's a great example of how we reach our community in different ways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it can't be understated. You know, one of the things that we know as paramedics is that people don't necessarily survive out of hospital cardiac arrest if they don't have bystander CPR. We know that you can bleed to death from a major injury for four from excuse me in less than 3 to 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so providing this community training and helping people to be able to help themselves and others we know is vital. And that really speaks to who we are and how we're embedded in this community. The Denver Health Paramedic Division exists to serve our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Beyond the ambulance response or excuse me, we are a core city service that contributes to the greater good of this amazing city. The Denver health paramedics are based out of an incredible hospital with integrated health care services. And, you know, leveraging the departments that we have within the hospital and bringing that care to the city is really'",

So I just want to talk about. The fact that I actually I support being able to make sure that our people, the residents and citizens of Denver have access to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'health care. I believe in something called Medicare for All, though I don't believe that Denver Health, which is a for profit organization, should be receiving more funding. Instead, we should fund Social. Social Security. We should fund Medicare and Medicaid.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that those who are not lucky enough to still be employed in the middle of a pandemic can still get help.

        "'speaker_4': 'Fatigue comes from significant daily call volume. Despair comes when my patients die. These things are to be expected during the pandemic. These are things I can handle. I can't handle being issued protective equipment, which won't survive the rigors of the ambulance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can't handle a lack of regular testing for a virus which spreads asymptomatically. I can't handle seeing turnover of expertize because we're paid significantly less than surrounding agencies. I can't handle seeing Denver health executives paid bonuses, which are equivalent in value to hazard pay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've been promised I can't handle constant phone calls from the Denver health billing environment for bills, for treatment from being assaulted on the job. I can't handle being actively targeted for making my voice heard. We will make it through this pandemic.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Denver Health workers are the safety net. We work tirelessly to protect the integrity of this network. We're the first to see when someone might fall through. So it is essential for workers to have the ability to sound an alarm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Strong workers are aggressive in protecting their patients. A strong union means a strong safety net. A strong union means. Lives saved. We all need to do our part to fight COVID 19. The public need to wear masks. Paramedics need to run, call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nurses need to treat patients. Doctors need to get care. Management needs to support workers. Our leaders need to keep us all protected. I ask you to pass the operating agreement for Denver Health and continue to vigilantly protect our constitutional right to organize.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'In addition to clinical excellence, we worked hard to improve access to bariatric surgery regardless of ability to pay and now for completely funded bariatric surgery. Two Denver County Residents Without Insurance. Earlier this year, I had the privilege of becoming the president of the Denver Health Medical Staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This role brings me face to face with the issue of physician well-being and burnout magnified exponentially during the COVID pandemic. I am proud of the commitment of our hospital to addressing health care worker, mental and physical fatigue, and the numerous free, confidential resources available to keep our practitioners safe and healthy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next week, I will complete a one day training to join over 50 volunteer volunteer providers in our resilience in stressful events. Arise Employees Psychological First Day Program. Finally, my role in the medical staff leadership has involved sharing our Medical Necessity Committee, which last year alone authorized charity funds to over 900 uninsured Denver County residents to undergo elective'",
        "'speaker_4': 'surgery procedures to restore quality of life and the ability to work or live independently. In many cases, we approved these surgeries after other hospitals with which the patients had prior relationships had denied them. There are, of course, many other examples of the effect that Denver Health has had on our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm fortunate to have been part of impacting access to high quality surgical care for our city's most vulnerable members. It remains the most important reason that I work here. Simply put, Denver would and could not be Denver without Denver health.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I'd like to thank the other folks who had signed up to speak tonight. And unfortunately, that's the 30 minutes that we had for the courtesy public hearing. And we also have another hearing after this one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so concluding our speakers questions from members of Council on Bill 1138. We have Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. I have a few questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have been trying to find a transparent wage and salary scale for all the employees at Denver Health. Does that exist?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is Robin went to see them, the CEO here at Denver Health. There's there's not a single published wage and salary scale, depending on the particular position. We use a variety of different salary surveys that are used to set the wage wages for different positions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And has there been an analysis of the pay equity within the organization that is public?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, we have, we actually have done an analysis of pay within the organization where we've compared every individual employee's salary to the 50th percentile for that particular job. Within each category, we said wage rate, salary range is based on market information that we have available.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our organization aims to pay approximately the 15th percentile for all of our employees, employees to come in. They start below that and then they can, over time, go above the 50 percentile. We actually just recently completed an analysis of all jobs to see how I would compare to the 15 percentile in total Denver Health with slightly above'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the 50th percentile for all positions at Denver Health and the positions at the lower end of the wage scale, primarily in our service. In our service, jobs were the highest above the 50th percentile on average. Now, of course, some people coming new into the organization may start below the 50% now, but over time they will increase, the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'salaries will be increased so that they can get above the 50% jump.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And since Denver health is a public health entity, I'm wondering if it's not. Is that data public? Lake City employees are salary information is public information. And even without the scale, is Denver Health's salary information subject to Cora?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is. And our salary information has been requested via request. And when when it is requested, we provide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Awesome. And I believe, Madam President, there was somebody who was present on the line to answer questions about the immigrant workforce at Denver Health. Is it possible to call up Sochi Gaitan?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can. So she has her hand raised. We'll go ahead and move around to panelists.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Sochi. I'm curious about some of the things that we've discussed regarding the immigrant workforce at Denver Health. Could you talk to me a little bit about what you are aware of there?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, the city councilwoman said about the thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the question I wanted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To share a few thoughts as I identify as a mexican born in Mexico, raised in Denver by immigrant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Parents, and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm a member of the Community Worker Alliance for a Healthier.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also speaking as co-chair of the Colorado Latino Forum. And so as an immigrant, I know that in all diverse immigrant communities, Denver Health has been the main resource for health care needs for our community. And so we deem it to be a really valuable one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I personally spent over 90 consecutive days last summer at Denver Health with my immigrant father who passed away of liver cancer late last year. I personally witnessed many inequities taking place for patients, but as well as workers. And so I just wanted to share with you all that there's community leaders like myself that are seeking to eliminate'",
        "'speaker_0': 'these health inequities, these and trying to keep our community safe, but building equity and solidarity with those workers at Denver Health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I wanted to share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A few thoughts about that. So I appreciate the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Question that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that city council should be able to uplift the health care workers by really supporting, supporting and voting yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On this bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that our Denver health workers are the true foundation of that hospital. And we know that those that workers rights and community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Safety of our community, it's all interconnected. And Denver health care workers, they should have a right to free association in unions and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They don't have that right right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's public funds being spent on diverting from patient care and worker safety to anti-union tactics. And we were hearing reports.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the Colorado Latino Forum that the custodial.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Workers were discouraged from forming a union. So we're really concerned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we know that this pandemic has compounded those inequities for our marginalized workers, especially our custodial workers, nurses, etc.. So justice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is required and we're.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carrying that burden as people of color. We're carrying the burden of racism.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And COVID 19. So thank you for asking the question, allowing me to share a little bit about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we're hearing from workers at Denver Health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please recognize that there's that paradigm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Paradigm shift is taking place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now in institutional racism. So I want to urge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You to vote yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And real quick, is it possible to ask Miss Valerie Collins, the attorney addressing the U.N., asking for more information on what the response from Denver Health has been since they have filed their complaint?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure if we can get Ms.. Collins to go ahead and. Raise her hand and we'll get her moved back into the panelists.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are we are we not seen?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not seeing this, Collins. I don't think she's still in the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can can Denver help respond to how they're correcting the allegations of union busting? How is that being addressed?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So again, this is Robin Wisniewski. Denver Health is not engaged in any any activities of union busting. So I can't tell you that I can't respond to that because we aren't doing it. And Ms.. Ms.. Collins mentioned a complaint, but we haven't seen anything, so I can't it would not have been a response since we haven't seen'",
        "'speaker_5': 'anything from from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's let me reframe the question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How our employees how are workers in this time being helped or supported in their efforts as they try to exercise their rights to unionize?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All our employees are being supported in many ways as we go through the COVID crisis. I think that you heard from a number of the people who spoke about COVID and the impact that it has had on health care.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Workers speak about some of the things, including the PPE, that we are providing to our employees who certainly have a great deal of expertize in infectious medicine. Dr. Pryce spoke about the work that she has been doing. We have highly, highly infectious disease teams that go out and do education for our employees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're making sure that they have the appropriate PPE and a work environment that allows them to stay as safe as we can possibly manage for them. All of our employees are free to interact with us, and we we do this regularly to find out what issues are of concern to them and how we can address anything that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'may be getting in the way of their ability to do their job safely and effectively to care for patients. Dr. Pratt, you mentioned the RISE program, and that's one that we have focused a great deal of time and energy on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It really is intended to help health care workers in particular, who are facing extraordinarily stressful events, although I'll confess that a pandemic may have been more than any of us ever expected to have to address and deal with the psychological challenges of living through the sorts of anxiety and stress that our employees are facing today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have worked to make sure that they have access to those. We've also been deeply involved in a lot of work around identifying issues and problems that our employees bring forward and then working to resolve those, including things around human resources, policies, work environment issues they may face in the in the workplace.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as we have spoken to our employees and identified issues that are of concern to them, the entire management team is working on different solutions to those issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as a funder and partner, what kind of assurance can we get as the city of Denver that you all will keep us in the loop about what is going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what allegations are being made throughout the next year of this contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think there are a couple of things that I would suggest in Campbell, and I certainly be very interested in any additional ideas and suggestions you would have. So one of the things that we started to do, and I hope that this is helping our employees and I hope it's valuable to city council as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have a number of initiatives that we feel are particularly important to Denver Health and the people that we serve. We've got work going on and I think I've talked to most of the council about this as an anchor institution in the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver Health provides a great deal of health care, of course. We also are deeply involved in education and research. But the other piece of who we are and who we stand for is as an anchor institution. And for Denver Health, what that really means is, in addition to providing for the the physical and mental health and well-being'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the people that we serve, we have an ability to offer economic opportunity to the to the community that we serve. So everything from the work that we're doing to try to make sure that our employees can earn a living wage, some of which will be through salary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But there are many other things, and I've spoken about some of those career pathways, making sure that the kinds of work supports that are available to people like child care support, earned income tax credits, those types of things that can really help support families and strengthen them during the kinds of economic challenges we're going through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've got a lot of work going on in that. We're also addressing issues of diversity, equity and inclusion. And I've said to all of the council members that I've spoken to, Denver Health is made up of people, and like any organization, like any group of people, there is work that we can do to improve diversity and equity'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and to address what really is the structural and systemic racism that exists in our society. Denver Health has signed on to racism as a public health crisis and really committed to addressing issues of diversity disparity both inside our organization and in the communities that we serve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then finally, we have been working with our employees and identifying anything that gets in the way of their being able to do their job effectively, to have a work environment that allows them to flourish and to truly do what they came here to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is an extraordinarily mission driven organization, and I can tell you without exception, every single person who works at Denver Health cares to the core of their being about who we are and what we do. So we are we send out about every other week.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We send out a communication with all of the different things that we're doing. And we're summarizing that. And we sent it off to City Council a number of times now, and I hope that that has been helpful to you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As I said before, I will come and talk to all of you or any of you individually. If there are issues or concerns that any employee brings to you, please send them to us and let us have an opportunity to employees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want to make sure that we hear concerns and then we have an opportunity to address those and to make changes where we need to. Because undoubtedly there will be times when changes are necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And my last question is for Katie Bakes. Is Ken Baker still on the line?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You got me. There's a handsome.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will get her promoted. And then.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is the last question I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have. Great. All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. All. Katie, my question for you is about the employee survey. Can you tell me a little bit about that employee survey that we discussed? You mean the Press Ganey survey? Yes. I have not seen it in its totality, but my understanding is that it is pretty dismal and much worse than it was previously and is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'peppered with concerns of lack of trust for executive leadership. I did have a statement prepared.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know and appreciate everybody's time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I personally have been targeted for speaking up and speaking up about concerns about equity. I run the same program that Michelle McDaniel so eloquently described.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My job is currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Under threat because I have spoken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Up and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I unfortunately am very disappointed by our leadership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I agree that the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Staff at Denver Health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Make up the heart and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Soul of Denver Health, and I have recently joined Denver Health Workers United because I understand that if I, as.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Being at Denver Health for 20 years can be retaliated against by the highest levels of our administration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That I cannot imagine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What frontline workers who don't have my title and come from underrepresented minority backgrounds must feel when they are trying to speak up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About their workers rights. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Misspeaks Ms.. Signer or Robin. I'm wondering if there's a potential.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For you to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report out to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Terminations and if people were.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Union affiliated. I'm curious to monitor who is being let go and if they are union affiliated. Is that a possible report out that you could include with your other report outs to us?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I certainly can't report out to you about union affiliation because I don't know. And we don't if that is something that if an employee is involved, that's up to them. And we don't ask the question, nor do I have any idea who the employees are who might be involved in terms of termination.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What I'd like to do, Councilwoman, is just have an opportunity to speak to general counsel. I do want to be careful that when it comes to situations of employees that we're protecting, we're protecting our employees privacy and rights.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I would want to talk to them before I give you an answer on that. If that's if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would be awesome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if it's possible to have a form at termination, asking the employee if it's if they're if they're authorizing you to release that information, that would be really helpful for us to monitor. Thank you. That's it for my questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'May I make one final comment? May I make one final comment that's related to that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very briefly, please. We've got four other people in the queue of questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted council to know that I before I joined Denver Health Workers United, I was called by my supervisor and H.R. because I was reported for recruiting people to the union. I was not a member of the union at the time, nor was I participating in that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that kind of direct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Puts fear into workers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It certainly put it in to me, and I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It goes counter to the statement that there is no effort to undermine the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Union.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thank you for sharing that, Councilman Torres. Thank you, Madam President. Just one question, and I'm sorry if I missed it. In the prior line of questioning, one of the commenters mentioned that they currently do not have a salary that meets the city's January one minimum wage level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does Denver health. Come into line with the minimum wage increases. Robin, I see you coming in there. But let me let me finish the question real quick. But I do know that you had mentioned raises. I'm just curious what the status of that looks like and whether or not you're exempt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are not exempt from that. So when the city's minimum wage went into effect last year, I think it went to 1277 or 1287. Denver Health raised the minimum wage here to $13 an hour. And we'll be raising our salary again to meet the minimum wage, I think.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we may be going to $15 an hour. So and then this year we did the we did merit increases for our employees. And our plan is to do the same thing again again next year. So we will we will be compliant with at least the minimum wage in the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. That was my only question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Next up, we have Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I thought I was later in the queue, so I was slightly underprepared. I. I want to ask Miss Biggs if she's still here. I want to ask one more question. She might have severe. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, moving on to other issues. Just so maybe it's you. You said that you had been retaliated against and you gave one example where you perceive the retaliation is do you have other examples or is that the primary example?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm just curious.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, sir. Thank you. I do have other examples because of the limitation in time, my statement only included.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What had happened with AIM.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I have experienced.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Retaliation multiple times.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For speaking up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would you say provide one more example? I'm not. You're right. Because of time. I don't I don't know if I can ask you for all of them, but perhaps one of their example.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've been retaliated against for advocating, for aim and to continue funding that we received through the city. I was told that I had undermined our CEO, Dr. Wittgenstein, because I had spoken to my colleagues in emergency medicine and trauma and they had written in to support the program to prevent it from being cut from the city budget'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And I was told by my direct supervisor, Dr. Nussbaum, that Robin had met with him and that she had told him that he did not like me because I undermined her authority because of the support for aim. She was forced to change her mind and keep AIM in the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'City budget and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That she would no longer support me and undermine the programs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I run.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you for. I'm. I'm hesitating because I'm thinking, What do I do? I want to try to go down and try to get by. But thank you for that that that answer. I was trying to decide if I want to get more clarity or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's good enough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Much. And then one previous person testifying said that claimed that Denver Health is a for profit institution. Is that the case?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, no, no. It's not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For profit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, I've. I figured that. I just wanted to make sure that I was not misunderstanding. Okay. So it doesn't appear that there's anyone who's asking us to vote no on the contract, but there does appear to be some concern about worker protection and worker organization.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that right? I think the contract is silent on worker organization. Does the contract have any opportunity to to say anything for or against worker organization?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is making the contract administrator and we can also promote the city attorney if we need to hear much better. It does not. It's silent on that, similar to any other kind of labor laws or otherwise. It doesn't dictate how Denver Health complies with those or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. And that's why I don't I don't need the attorneys perspective. I think that's fine enough. Thank you. The. I think, Dr. Weinstein, I think you and I had talked about this before. I just want to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Should the Denver health workers want to unionize? Is that something Denver Health would support?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our our sense is that working directly with our employees on issues that they raised is the best way for us to resolve those. And that is the approach that we've taken. At the same time. At the same time, we're not we're not involved in or interfering with the union activities that employees may engage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Up. And this is a contract. We can either vote yes or no on and we can suggest amendments. Right. This is I mean, this is like every other contract we can suggest in there. I see a bunch of heads nodding at them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if everyone watching the Zoom call or Tally can see that, but multiple colleagues are nodding your head. So I'm just going to keep going. The does the contract or I forgot to ask does the contract ask talk about access to PPE for its workers, though it's something else that was also discussed as a concern'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I think it's dependent on the section of the contract and what what type of work is being, you know, provided in each section. I'm not sure the level of detail in the operating agreement gets to the level of detail that states what type of PPE and the amount of PPE.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's somewhat dictated by the kind of overarching services provided and Denver Health's kind of rules and regulations associated with PPE. So I don't think the contract gets into the level of detail you may be describing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. That's fair. I mean, it's it's a bunch of money, so I can understand why you might not have. 87 and 95 masks or whatever. I get that. So perhaps I could ask this. Do Denver Health Workers have adequate PPE?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. So, Councilman. Oh, I'll start answering the question and then I'm going to ask Dr. Price to jump in, because she really is our infectious disease expert. So Denver Health has adequate stock of PPE to take care of our employees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have very specific guidelines around the type of PPE based on the risk that the employee has in different situations. Of course, like every other health care provider in the country, the way that PPE is used today is different than the way it was used a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Obviously, the pandemic has been, as I said, it's not just it's not just in health. It's not just Colorado. It touches the United States. The entire world is in the grips of this. So it has changed how deeply is used.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we do have adequate stocks of PPE and that Dr. Price can share with you some of the over kind of the overarching principles that we use. And frankly, we would be happy to send to the entire council the same communication that we send to all of our employees that lists all of the main pieces of PPE'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that are important for them. And we provide them on a weekly basis a list of all the PPE we have in the stock that we have available to us so that everybody can know exactly what we've got and make sure that they're feeling comfortable because we have a lot of people who were concerned at the beginning, particularly'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the pandemic, when it was really hard to get to get some of the items that we needed that we would run out. And so we started sharing with our employees, this is what we have. So perhaps Dr. Price can jump in and just share some information with you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So hello, counsel and hello. Thank you for asking this question. It's this was one of the most stressful efforts during the first wave of COVID. And not only to those of us trying to make sure we never ran out, but to those on the front line.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of us were hearing about shortages nationally of PPE. All of us were hearing about our colleagues running out of PPE and other places having to use their masks for a week at a time, having to bake them at home to sterilize them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We did none of that at Denver Health. We followed our crisis standards of care guidelines for PPE from the state of Colorado. We actually exceeded what the CDC recommended. And as part of transparency, because it's so important when you are going to see a patient that you can feel confident in your PPE.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We started sharing with our staff our days on hand of PPE. It wasn't always pretty, but there were always PPE. And what we do is we take our stock and we look at that week of use, the week prior, and we say, okay, based on use for that week, that volume of use, how many days on and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'would we have as PPE if we started the entire supply chain stock? And we don't take for granted that that supply chain is going to keep coming in. We actually do plan for one day it could stop and we provide those data to our staff and weekly emails and we have been doing that since the beginning of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this pandemic. I am happy to include the City Council on all of those data so you can monitor it with us. And my gosh, if you ever see any red on that chart or numbers of days on hands that you don't like, we would happily take your help in sharing the PPE.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The other piece of this is making sure that our staff are confident and able to use the PPE effectively that they have. And we have been very deliberate in our training and utilizing these wonderful employees, these talented staff who I've been working with for 18 years to help educate each other and support each other in confidence and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'use of PPE.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And so, Madam President, just one final question. I went to the Denver health paramedics luncheon and they were doing a fundraiser for paramedics because apparently the paramedics don't have enough shirts as they switch shirts from one call to the next.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and so the luncheon was doing a fundraiser for t shirts. For the paramedics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is this. Yeah, the fundraiser, actually, the main the main beneficiary of the fundraiser is the paramedic scholarship. So getting going for training to be a paramedic is, um, you get through school and you pay tuition. The fundraiser is intended to, um, to help raise money for scholarships for that we do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, also we bought, um, we bought paramedics different out of uniform uniforms. It is. I'm sure you're used to the fact that the Denver health paramedics have traditionally worn a white shirt. What we found when we got into the pandemic is that they were uncomfortable, that they were going from cold, cold, cold with the same shirt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we ended up for the summer. We had t shirts for the winter. They're actually going to be longer, long sleeved shirts. They're all blue. Um, and we have, we've had a lot of people say, can I help support the paramedic by donating money for t shirts and shirts, etc..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, so some of it was used during that. It was, it's a way to connect to the community who really does want to support our first responders during, uh, during this crisis. But the very large bulk of the money that was raised is going into scholarships for people, particularly people of color, people who live in poverty to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'go through training to become a paramedic. It really you heard from you heard from more than one paramedic tonight. It really is an amazing profession for somebody to get involved in, to have an impact on the lives of people at their most vulnerable point in time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When they i, i, i have called 911 myself. That is a moment in time when you are afraid for yourself or a family member. And when the paramedics show up, all of a sudden, you know, things are going, you've got somebody there who can help and everybody wants to help the paramedics and the first responders.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it's within that spirit of letting people help by supporting the cost of t shirts and church for the paramedics. But the bulk of the money is going into scholarships for people who couldn't afford to become a paramedic otherwise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Zoya.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For for being here. Really appreciate it. Really appreciate the the comments that we heard and and and the information that we're getting from the Denver health leadership. So I just want to know kind of from the perspective of our legal team and if we were to if there were seven people who felt like, based on the testimony'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we heard tonight, this was not a contract or a relationship that we wanted to support anymore. What would happen then?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. I I'm fairly new to the city, but my sense from the years that this has been approved over and over, as there'd be starting January 1st, a pretty huge gap in services that are paid for under the agreement, because I believe language is written that essentially for core services under the agreement, Denver Health has sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the first right of refusal. And again, maybe we'll call up Mitch Bear, the attorney, to probably speak more eloquently on this than I. But first, right of refusal for those, of course, services. Unless that's the case, there's no backup option.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Unless they defer to a second party, there's no backup option. And for the non-core services, we would have to go through a procurement process to identify alternate service providers for every portion of the agreement that wasn't approved for those services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And obviously, the services in the agreement that the city provides back to Denver health would not be provided as of January 1st as well. And we're talking about a huge breadth of potential services and things that are critical on a day to day basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, thanks. So so it would be safe to say it would be incredibly irresponsible governance to vote down this contract tonight and not have any sort of backup option for, you know, our health services in the middle of a pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I mean, I don't you know, it's hard to, but personally. Yes. And I think it's an obvious yes for the city. The Denver health serves a great number of the vulnerable, you know, residents in our city, even more so in the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And although these are kind of, you know, difficult conversations to be grappling with today. Yes, I would say yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Fair. I mean, I agree with you. I'm just but that's what I'm asking the questions. Right? I mean, we're required. And I think it's important for the community and the people who are watching to sort of understand the breadth and depth of what this contract actually does for our communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So wanted to make sure that we kind of got that out there. So. So but that said, right. There's if this is a concern, what does this look like for 2022? Are there conversations we can be having with Denver Health now to potentially talk about some of these concerns or address some of these issues for the 2022'",
        "'speaker_0': 'contract? Or when would that start or what do those conversations look like? I guess how do we address the situation? I guess my question is how do we address the situation proactively in the future so that for the 2022 contract, we do not find ourselves over a barrel, so to speak, with zero backup options in the middle'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of a pandemic for providing city services when it comes to a health provider and not being happy with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Way our health provider and not having any other options and and not having any other.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Choice, I guess. Yeah. Negotiations for 2022 start as early as the spring. March-April timeframe is when we start conversations with city agencies around what's working in the operating agreement for the work that they're receiving in the services that are being provided.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know what? What would they like to address and change? And that's when the negotiations start as early as April timeframe. And so, you know, Will is probably best suited to maybe talk about process here. But I think leading into that time frame, hearing thoughts and input from city council, from residents, from folks across the city who'",
        "'speaker_1': 'agencies that are receiving the services and supporting this work, I think receiving input in that time frame leading up to April, there's plenty of months of negotiation happening between April and say today in the fall, but negotiations start as early as the spring of next year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Sawyer. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. I first want to make a comment and then I have two brief questions. I want to thank the employees who reached out to talk with me and to share some of their concerns. I also want to thank Dr. Wittgenstein and Dr. Price for giving back to me and their willingness to sit down and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'meet and talk with the employees who I met with. And so basically where in the in the middle of just waiting to get the names of the employees who who are willing to be part of that meeting to sit down, to share their detailed and specific concerns about what those those issues related to safety and, you know'",
        "'speaker_1': ', just practices where they feel like their their safety or the public safety has been compromised, whether it's from the paramedic unit or the nursing unit or any of the the doctors who are willing to come forward. So. And it's not always easy when people have to be brave to step up and speak out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I appreciate everybody on all sides and their willingness to sit down and figure out how do we how do we get through this? I wanted to ask Valerie Collins if she could come back on, if she's still available to answer two quick questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the councilwoman had tried to call her up before and I don't believe she will.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me see if someone else is available, can answer these two questions. I'm trying to find out if and maybe Dr. Woodson can answer the first one. Are you aware of other public hospitals that have their employees that are unionized?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's one question. And then the second is, I'm just trying to find out, has there been any identified date or timeframe in which there's a hope and expectation to have a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vote of the employees?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do have Ms.. Collins backup as well. So we'll go ahead and let the Denver health answer and then we have in this column.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Councilwoman, I am aware of other other public safety institutions that have a variety of employees who may be denied. And I'm not aware of any event, any dates in relation to your second question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right, Miss Collins. Do you want to address either one or both of those questions?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We might have to have you unmute, Ms.. Collins. All right. Well, we might not. We thought we had her promoted. Yep, we got her on. But for whatever reason, we're not getting a response. Councilwoman, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right. No problem. Thank you for letting me ask those questions. And I do look forward to helping facilitate that conversation. That's one of the things that I was asked by the employees when I met with them if I was willing to help facilitate getting a meeting together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one of the board members was involved in helping to make that happen. And Dr. Weinstein felt that it was more appropriate to have Dr. Pryce be the point person who oversees, you know, part of the operations of the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we're in the middle of trying to get that coordinated. So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. And I'd also like to thank all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The speakers in Timber Health for joining us this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evening. So, Dr. Weinstein.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On May 19th, you received a letter from 14 state senators, 29 state representatives, three U.S. Congress members and nine city council members. Do you remember getting that letter?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you respond to any of them? Did you respond to anybody?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I did not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why what?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why wouldn't you respond to a letter that came from 14 state senators, 29 state representatives, three US Congress members, and nine city council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The the letter was a statement of support for employees who are interested in unionize and didn't require a response.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as a public hospital, you don't think that acknowledging a letter from 14 state senators, 29 state representatives, three U.S. Congress members and nine city council members doesn't elicit a response.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman. The letter came as a statement of support for activities that the employees were engaged in and didn't ask any questions. It didn't require to request a response. And we did not feel that there was anything that needed to be responded to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'll just say that I get a lot of letters of support on my council office and I get a lot of inquiries in my council office, and I acknowledge every single one of them. I feel like that's my duty as a public servant is to acknowledge them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you and I may have just have to respectfully disagree on that one. Um, so under this operating agreement, there's the Denver Public Health and the Denver Department of Health and Environment. There's a shift taking place. I would like to know how long has Denver Health known about the shift that would affect the funding?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um. Can you help me understand what shift you're talking about?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So basically the Denver the Department of Denver will take over what Denver Public Health is doing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is not what is in the agreement. We have agreed that next year and frankly, we were hopeful that we would be past the pandemic when we had the conversations that Denver Public Health and DDP would enter into conversations about how public health services are organized in the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Obviously, coming through the pandemic, we both had significant learnings about how to handle a pandemic, how services work effectively, where there may have been points, opportunities for improvement. So we agreed that we would sit down and have a conversation about those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is no wholesale shifting of responsibilities from Denver Public Health to simply an agreement that we will have a conversation. And if we agree that there are any any services where there should be a change based on the mutual agreement of Denver, Denver health and the city, that we would work through that in 2021.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've come through a situation that, frankly, none of us had ever seen before. I think to not sit down and have a conversation about what did we learn and how can we organize ourselves differently, perhaps so that we can better serve the people who live in the city and county of Denver?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It wouldn't have made sense. So that's what the operating agreement change said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I've heard comments about the employee engagement survey. Is there any opportunity to send those to all of the city council members? The results suggest.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That we that is not something that we would send to city council. I'm happy to to to share with you that the employee engagement survey is something that we do approximately once every year to 18 months. It's a follow up to the work that we did with our leaders in the organization after the situation we had in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the spring and we asked for it, we told our employees that we would come back to them and ask them for information about a whole host of things that go on in Denver health, much as we do each year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we did it again this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can you can share any like high level results with any of us?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um. Let me. Let me pull out what we can share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That would be great. I would like to see that survey. It's been brought up several times in public comment and through the conversations that I have still as a voting member of Council on the operating agreement, I would love to see what the employees of Denver Health are saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as much as you could share would be greatly appreciated. And just a few more questions. So regarding diversity, equity and inclusion, are you currently working with the Denver Office of Social Equity and Innovation?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are not we're not working with them yet, although we're as we're working right now with the Equity Project, which is an organization based here in Denver that focuses on diversity, equity and inclusion in organizations much like Denver Health, where just we've just started that engagement and we will be working with with them and then we will'",
        "'speaker_5': 'be engaging the city's office because they've got some expertize there as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. And one last question. How are you engaging with communities specific necks with this recent surge of COVID cases to minimize and equitable health outcomes?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, there are, there are a number of things that Denver Health does, and there's additional things that we are also doing. We have, as you know, community health centers that are scattered across the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so they're deeply embedded in their neighborhoods. We engage with various different neighborhoods and groups that live in those neighborhoods through the clinic. We also have we have a patient advisory committee. We have a the Community Health Services Board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you heard from Carol Lewis is the chair of that. The Community Health Services Board is the group that oversees all of our community health centers. They have 51% or more of the members of that board are actually patients of Denver's Denver health.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there's a wide diversity of representation on that. We use that as a way to bring in additional information. And most recently, we've started a community engagement committee of the board of directors and paired who is the chair of our board can speak to it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But but really it was intended to be a way for both management and the board to look at issues around diversity, equity, inclusion, or our role as an anchor institution and how we can advance economic opportunity in the community and really make sure that we are continuing to move towards the vision of bringing both bringing opportunity out'",
        "'speaker_5': 'into the community, but also bringing community voices. And we have a number of community organizations. I think, Councilwoman, it's about ten, although I don't remember the exact number of different organizations from the community that have been asked to join that committee and help bring additional voice of the community back into the organization.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also do things like regular community engagement surveys. We did a community engagement strategic plan about 18 months to 18 months ago or so, obviously COVID. And it's trying to kick in for a lot of things. There are there are differences.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the COVID has had a disparate impact on a number of populations. We are looking at, um, through our public health department and our community health services division. Where has there been different impact on different populations and how can we help to remedy some of that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The mobile health ban you heard about, for example, we have areas of our communities where there are high rates of cases and low rates of testing. That mobile health ban is intended to help rectify that and bring out into the community that has been so significantly affected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Additional resources, both testing but also care and education around COVID. Um, at this time for exactly that reason, we're very concerned about the disparate impact that coping with that. And you've heard the reasons for it a lot of times on this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The people are essential workers. They, they go to work because they have to and then they are at higher risk of potentially contracting COVID. And for many people, um, with, with complications and comorbidities, the impact is even more significant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'll let I'll let Pia also speak to that. Good evening, council members and commentators. My name is Pia Dean. I am a Denver native and a Denver resident. I live in area code 80209. I am the chair of the Board of Denver Health and Hospital Authority, and we specifically wanted to get to this specific issue of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'how do we get more community voice in at the highest level of the organization. So we in the last year have created this committee, engagement committee and are in the process of inviting and I think it's closer to 15 different entities have now agreed to be part of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've only had no's from two and both because they were overwhelmed by the requests they were getting for help from their own community. So the goal is to have that information pulled in and to create partnerships. It works toward the entire institution concept where we're both hiring locally and in sourcing locally, but also hearing from the fair'",
        "'speaker_5': 'communities that we serve. So. That's been the approach from the board level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval. The public hearing for Council Bill 20, dash 1138. Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Torres. Okay, you're getting in there. All right. The public hearing for Council Bill 20, Dash 1130 is closed. Councilwoman Torres comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much, Madam President. Denver Health mine is just, I think, a message and a plea. Basically your crucial institution in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know and you know the work that you do in District three is immense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your main campus is in District three, West Side Clinic, and your clinic and across the street from the Colfax and Perry location. Your value is based not just on transactions and services, but on trust. And it's critical that you regain trust if you lose the confidence of your team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver Health will implode. Either this is your commitment to rectify or it isn't. People don't become nurses, therapists, EMTs, medical assistance because they're going to make millions of dollars. They do it because they want to be of service to individual and community health and well-being.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It doesn't serve the city to vote down this operating agreement. It does, however, serve the city for you to be a better employer, to respect the right of your employees, to organize and give them a workplace that they feel safe and that they can be proud of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The health of our entire city depends on it, and never more than what we've seen lately in a pandemic. So I just implore you to be that employer, to be that entity and that institution in Denver. And I ask you to let me know how I can help you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank everyone at Denver Health who is here. I, I owe Denver Health my life. I might have said this before, but I think now is a good time to say it again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was in a crash and ah, ah, ah. Sorry. I was in a crash on August 26, 2008 at 18th and Logan. It's very close to Kaiser Saint Joe's, Purcell, Kindred and the ambulance went the other way and went to Denver Health and and it was thanks to thanks to Denver Health that I survived.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I spent eight days in secure surgical ICU and another five days in stepped down. And I, I don't remember much about it because I was on some pretty heavy medication at the time. But. But I do, I do remember snippets of being at Denver Health and I and I and I understand and respect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The work that you do. And I want to thank you for all that you do for for underserved communities, for me and so many other people. I also I invite you to in this time when we have so many health workers just, you know, at wit's end, at breakdown stage, there was a Denver Post article on Sunday'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that talked about by National Jewish actually as what it was. And it had some really stark black and white photos. And and I'm I'm concerned that that our workers are are in trouble. I know I'm not a health worker myself, but but from what I hear from other health workers, I'm concerned.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I hope that you lift up our health workers, as you mentioned, your you know, your hospital and just and frankly, any organization and a city for that matter, what is a city but its people, you know, the hospital is no better or worse than the people who work there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I just want to make sure that they have what they need to succeed. As my colleagues will recall, I was the lone no vote for providing PPE to the and to small businesses. And the reason I said that is because I wanted to make sure that health workers, front line workers, had PPE.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I couldn't get an answer on whether our health workers in Denver had access to food. So I care very much about our workers. I want to make sure that they can succeed. The the hospital itself, the building did not save my life.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was the people who work there. So so I thank you so much for your for your efforts, for your leadership. I, I hope that you continue to keep workers in the forefront. And, and and I would challenge you to push them even more in the forefront.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Hines. And just a quick time check. I know we still have some folks that are staying on the line. We have one more courtesy public hearing that will begin immediately after our vote on this. And we have three more folks in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Sandra.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Foster.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President, and thank you, Denver Health for all that you do. I am looking at your values and you talk about excellence, compassion, relentlessness, stewardship and learning. And I really believe that you do care about those values.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just hope that as these your workers who are unionize, that you respect those values as well, that you expect excellence from them, that you offer them some compassion, that you offer them learning opportunities. I believe that Denver Health is a foundation in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't ever remember. I always remember it in general. And my whole entire life I've known that you can go there and you can get services that are needed. And to everyone else's point, you don't go into the health care industry to make a lot of money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You go into service, same as city council. I'm here to serve the people. And so I feel a bit disappointed that once again, a whole entire letter was sent. I in all my years on council, I've never seen so many people come together from the US Congress to city council to state reps to senators, all to sign'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on a letter of support and to not receive a response does not feel very like bridge building. It does not feel very good. I get tons of emails and my job as an elected official who takes public money is to respond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I implore you to actually work with us. We are not the enemy. We want to see you succeed because your success means success for the people of Denver. Your success means health care for the people of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Health care for those who are disadvantaged. So I will be supporting this tonight, but I will be making sure that I do my homework and check on the operating agreement next spring. So I'm much more involved and we don't have to have a public hearing like this late into the evening next year.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Council President. I won't repeat what all of my colleagues have said, but I agree with it 100%. I think everyone is spot on and I'm very appreciative of all of their comments. And I and I agree 100%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to say how frustrating I think I am, how frustrated I am, and how frustrating I think it is to find ourselves in this position again where we have no other choice. We are out of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have no other option. We are forced to vote yes on a contract we are not happy with. As a provider, we are not happy with because we have. No other choice. We've been given no other option, and we were not a part of the conversation to begin with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that that's not acceptable. And so to Didi G to the administration, I think that this needs to be a part of a conversation where we come together and talk about how our values as a government won't need to be reflected in the contracts that we have and in the contracts that we approved moving forward'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I think this is something that keeps coming up repeatedly and and has come up several times.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Of this fall and this year now. And so, you know, once is maybe a one off. Twice is a pattern. Three times. Four times. Now, this is for sure a pattern. And it's something that we need to come together and and discuss, I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just wanted to put that out there. Thanks so much to everyone who spoke out tonight. I really appreciate it. And I will be supporting this not because I don't know, because I want to, but because I have no other choice.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'That you all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'May see tonight's vote as a victory. But this is personal for me. These are my I have friends and family members who have devoted their lives to Denver health. And the ability to know what's going on from the inside is not going anywhere.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we will be paying attention to exactly what is going on in there. From the emails you send to employees, to the trainings that you're doing, to the PowerPoints that you're doing, we see them all. And the only thing saving this contract in this moment is the fact that we have a city that is dying, literally'",
        "'speaker_0': 'dying, and we have to vote tonight to protect them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But this is not a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vote of confidence in Denver health at all. And I want that to be very clear. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. I first want to thank all of the speakers. You know, the high level, you know, surgeons, the front line EMTs. And I think that what is really clear is that there is incredible pride and there is an incredible array of really high quality services being provided by this hospital in our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it is special. There's not a competitor. There's not another public hospital that takes every person, regardless of insurance, regardless of immigration status. And that's okay, right? Because that is what a safety net is. A safety net doesn't, you know, compete based on profit or price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It just serves everybody. I really want to appreciate the thoughtfulness of the speakers, and I think it's telling that as frustrated as clearly some of the workers were, they are putting the hospitals best interests ahead of their own personal feelings and were united in supporting this contract moving forward because it's in the best interests of the hospital'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I ask, I think the management and the the the board to really reflect on that. Right. And I think, you know, we don't spend a lot of time talking about what a union is in these debates. It ends up kind of being more of a political back and forth about who did what and how unfair it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'was. But the essence of what we're talking about here is this idea that there can be value to a collective voice. And this is the disconnect I keep hearing. I heard it tonight, which is we're interested in hearing from our employees directly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it misses that employees have an opinion about how they communicate and where they choose to communicate collectively. There's a reason there, and it might actually have value to you as a system, as a hospital system. And other employers, for example, will find that you might have 100 requests from employees and you maybe can't afford 100 requests'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But if those employees collectively prioritize what they think is most important and narrow it down to two or three, then how powerful that can be for you to work with them collectively on those two or three priorities. Those are the essences here about and problem solving, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the other essence that, you know, we're a collective group of employees can share ideas for efficiency or improve patient care. I heard that tonight. I heard interest in making sure there wasn't disruption in personnel. Right. That that the protective equipment is related to absences.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That testing is related to not infecting patients. I heard patients at the center of the conversation tonight, and I guess I would ask that there's a script sometimes I've, you know, watched this for many years where, you know, oh, this must be bad.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We must try to stop it. We must have consultants, we must have closed door meetings. And it's a script that that doesn't pause to reflect and what the potential benefits are, what the potential opportunities are, and the value of just being neutral, the value of just allowing the workers to decide how they want to communicate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't lose your opinion. And as a management team you don't lose your opinion as a board, you simply have an opportunity to have a more organized conversation. That's the value here. And so I ask that we reflect on those things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually am proud to vote on this contract tonight, but I do that with the hope that this conversation creates new questions and reflections, that I don't just keep hearing the same script that that frankly isn't engaging with the underlying question of what's the opportunity here, what's the potential benefit, and what might be better for patients in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the long run in terms of an organized communication with a group of employees who can prioritize and not you won't be able to do everything. You are a public hospital, you are as limited as we are as a local government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just think it's important to reflect a little bit on these underlying pieces. So so I am proud to support Denver Health tonight and I am proud to support the Denver health workers. I don't believe this is a choice between the two of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't believe either of you in the end believe that you can make a choice between the two, that that is that that you are inextricably linked and being neutral and allowing the employees to make some of the choices about how they communicate with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hope that we aren't here next year, but I move forward with the pride that you are all interrelated and you have the power to improve our community working collaboratively. And I hope that happens. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to win support. Show my support for the contract. I do not feel forced to vote a particular way. I am happily able to support this contract. I remember back in 2011, 2012, when Denver Health opened the Montello clinic and the work that that and I actually have to but I just'",

I think about losing my grandmother to COVID and who was the health care worker that was with her when she took her last breath. And I think about my family members that I know that work in the health care industry and dear friends and thank you for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all that you do during this pandemic and even before, because that's very real and personal to me. And I. Second Councilwoman Canisius, I don't I don't believe this should be about picking a side. I willingly support this because of the great work that you do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I thank the leadership team because issues have been brought forward today. You did not have the appropriate time to respond to defend yourself. And I could have asked questions. But this isn't the right forum to do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This should need to be not publicly at a city council. Mary, But I trust that you have heard some of the concerns and that you will address them. And so that's why I feel very good saying, yes, I will support this and thank you for all that you do each and every day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon, and I'll just chime in. Definitely. Thank you all to all of the speakers and and the hospital care workers who had an opportunity to sit and visit with some of you recently. And really what you're asking for is not off the charts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's to have a plan. It's to value your safety. It's to improve your work culture. It's to lower the bureaucracy that you work in. And I hope that this gives the folks that testified tonight a voice and an opportunity to share that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But knowing that there's hundreds more that have some of these very same concerns, and I look forward to paying attention to what's happening a bit more and hearing from those employees and folks on both sides so that we can get to a better place to protect people who are, in turn, protecting the public.'",

    "Third Amendatory Agreement with Brothers Redevelopment for TRUA Program.": [
        "'speaker_2': '13 Eyes Council Bill 20 Dash 1138 has passed. Councilmember Sandoval, will you please put Council Resolution one, two, three, six on the floor for adoption? Oh, I think you're needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No worries. That's not going away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wrote that council resolution 20 days, 1236 to be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It has been moved. And second view councilman herndon. The 30 minute courtesy public hearing for council resolution 20 Dash 1236 is open. Maybe tell the staff the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Good evening. Melissa today with the denver department of housing stability. We'll try to be brief. I know I'm standing in the way of you and probably nighttime chores. So today we are have before you a contract amendment with brothers redevelopment for a temporary rental and utility assistance program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This amendment would add $250,000 and extend the contract to March 31st of 2021. As many of you know, this program provides up to six months of rental assistance and two occurrences of utility assistance. Currently, we are paying the full amount due and serves residents at or below 80% of the area median income.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with this total contract, we expect to serve approximately 985 duplicated households. As many of you know and recent national reports continue to explain, we are facing major concerns in terms of renters not being able to pay their rent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a recent report found that one in four renters nationally have no or only slight confidence that they can pay their next month's rent on time. And in Colorado, unpaid rent could be more than $600 million by 2021.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's a more recent report that did a calculation for what could the cost of evicted rent renters who become homeless costs, which found that in Colorado, that would be between 724,000,001.7 billion. We have recently made some changes to our application and processes to more quickly serve residents who need rental and utility assistance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we did, in previous contract amendments, remove the requirement for residents to pay. A portion of our new application that went into effect in September now provides a self attestation for hardship rather than documentation. We are utilizing income qualification, leveraging documentation based on receiving other benefits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Provided a clear checklist for required documents translated into several languages and continued to do so for those that are needed. And we are working with our community navigators and others to receive ongoing feedback and make changes as necessary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also been doing a lot of work focused on equity as part of this program. We have more formalized partnerships between community navigators and our tour administrators and nonprofits. That includes trainings as well as ongoing monthly meetings. And when I think the Neighborhood Equity Stabilization Team who funded some organizations for community navigation and this purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've also been working closely with the Office of Social Equity and Innovation, as well as UC Berkeley. We are in the midst of a racial equity project targeting mailers to residents living in neighborhoods vulnerable to eviction and involuntary displacements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Testing, different messaging and then evaluating short and longer term outcomes. We're further working with the Office of Social Equity and Innovation on our equity plan. So while I know we gave a presentation to Safety Committee a few weeks back, we know that that's not a full equity analysis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we are committed to and grateful for Oakley's support and commitment in furthering our work and improving our data collection and analysis on equity, not just for this program, but for many programs, policies and investments. So far this year, we've served over 2000 on duplicated households.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is more than double what we were able to serve in 2019. So it's been a huge commitment to our nonprofits and our partners. And obviously, the. Commitment and assistance with the community navigation piece has been critical. We also have seen an increase in the number of a number of months of assistance in 2019 that averaged about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two months. And this year we're seeing a higher average at three months. I'm going to read this to you because I think it's important. I don't think that we give our nonprofits enough of our thank you's as well as our community navigators.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also have heard of a staff member and a community navigator who have both been diagnosed with COVID one, who's a single mother of several children, one who is pregnant. And so I think taking an opportunity to just thank them and hear the story from one of our our local navigators.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a navigator, I'm the front line person. I gather information to create intakes and make sure people can access an application. I listen to people's stories of crisis and validate their feelings while giving them hope. The help is within reach because whether they owe $50 or 5000, their crisis is real.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I laugh with people and help them forget their troubles for a few minutes. Every so often I hear a story that leaves the lasting impression. Like the frail voice of an 80 year old woman. Who was two days away from eviction or the 20 year old college student who cried in disbelief that we would help him pay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'his rent. Or the mother who described to me what it was like to sleep in her car with her five kids. Upon being evicted. Then there was the woman who buried her husband who had succumbed to COVID 19 on Sunday and left a hysterical voice message, pleading for help with her utilities on Monday.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sometimes I have to pause and have and have a cry. Then I make the next call. I've been on the receiving end of assistance and there's nothing worse than being kicked when you're down. The most gratifying part of my job is the thanks I receive from people for treating them with kindness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even if I wasn't able to help them. Although my hope is that COVID 19 will be eradicated and there will no longer be a need for truth, I fear that that will be a long time coming. And for now, funding for this program is beyond necessary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's crucial. And I'll just end on several snippets of letters that our nonprofits have received over the last few months from recipients of the rental assistance program. And so today we are asking for your support and approval of this contract amendment for brothers redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll take questions. And I also believe we have Kim Desmond with the Office of Social Equity and Innovation on ABIE with Brothers Redevelopments and Jana Happel with Colorado Legal Services, who are available as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Well, thank you very much, Melissa. And we have five individuals signed up to speak this evening, and our first speaker is Jana Happel. Hello? Can you hear me? Mm hmm. Go ahead. So because of.'",

So this is going to help a lot of people remain in their homes now with without it not be able to and would be on the streets being swept up by the car'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when I spoke earlier tonight. So I'm definitely in favor of this. I just had a few questions. Let's. To date, how many families or individuals has served? And going on into the future, does it expect to serve? And.'",

But I do just want to reiterate my support for this program and speak a little bit about the partnership that we have with Brothers redevelopment'",
        "'speaker_0': 'from Brothers redevelopment reached out in June, July of this year to begin a partnership with this program in order to expand access to the trail program. Because we know that it's one of the strongest tools that Denver has to help families stay in their homes and in their communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we also know that a lot of families either don't know that the program exists. They need some level of assistance to complete the application, to gather documentation, and some maybe just don't feel comfortable applying for a variety of reasons, including concerns over residency and citizenship.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so Brothers has been really great about working with our connectors to train them on the application process. Melissa mentioned that for presentation to answer any questions as they arise to troubleshoot if there are any difficult applications or challenges.'",

And the changes that have been made to the application have just really improved the process and made it much easier for people to get through the program, get their applications submitted and get the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'support that they need. And so a few of the changes that I want to highlight that I think have contributed to increasing access to this program includes increasing language access, which means having an application translated, but it also means having people who are able to assist applicants directly in their language.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So our bilingual connectors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Example, have been really critical in reaching residents and helping them process the application. We also have a direct referral system with brothers so that people who indicate that they need assistance to complete their application get referred directly to the Western Community Connector program and then can get walk through your application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this means if they need to, they can come in to fill the application out, they can do it over the phone, they can have it dropped off. So this has been really critical for people who previously may have needed to wait to get their application in the mail and then had to figure out how to fill'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that out on their own. It also includes gathering documents, printing, scanning. We're doing direct mailers to vulnerable printer households to let them know about the program and how to access it. But we also know that knowledge is not enough and that we really need these programs and connectors who are able to build trust and answer questions as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're moving into month nine of this pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know that people really need this program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for your support that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Well, thank you, Megan. And that concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Councilwoman Ortega. All right. We're going to try to get Councilman Ortega here. All right. We might go ahead and bounce over. Councilwoman Cates, do you want to go ahead and go?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thank you, Madam President. I want to thank the speakers and the staff. Melissa, I just wanted to ask one update from committee. When you were in committee, you reported on the raw numbers of recipients by neighborhood. But I asked you to wait that by by number of renters, because sometimes raw numbers can be misleading.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where you have neighborhoods with mega complexes, they might have a high number, but a low percentage. Did you do that? And how did some of the nest neighborhoods come out when you rent, when you waited the recipients of the aid by their by their number of renters?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you just respond on that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, our data analyst did add that category to the dashboard that she created. It's okay. I'll share my screen. I actually have that in the appendix. Little late on a monday to operating quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You feel you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know, I know. We're all in this together. All right. So this is the 2020 payments, January through September of this year, weighted by the number of renters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what this shows us. I'm just looking at just making sure I'm reading this right. We've got Globeville here is at and DIA is a little bit of an anomaly. It's got 90 applicants, but it's got a smaller number of four.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so we got a far northeast neighborhood there. But the Globeville here at 3.7 is is the second highest rate, for example, twice as high as Capitol Hill at 1.6. Am I reading that right? So as a percentage of renters who are in the neighborhood who've applied for this assistance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so we've got West Colfax is a East Colfax I'm sorry, is in this neighborhood. We've got Elyria, Swansea in there, Westwood. We've heard from tonight. So, so many of these neighborhoods, as I look at this, are are in the highest percentage of renters receiving assistance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just thought this was important to put in context as an update since committee, it doesn't mean we don't have more work to do, but thank you for explaining.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are in fact giving more assistance to the neighborhoods that are more vulnerable to displacement. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry about that. I was talking away and realized that I wasn't connected, so. No. Is there someone from Bray that can answer a couple of questions? I heard we had somebody from there. Yeah, I think we have Jeff Martinez, the executive director, as well as Gabby.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. If they can raise their hand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So is he promoted yet?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm working on it. It's just martinis. If you could raise your hand. Who is the other person? Melissa. And you got Jeff. Jeff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Jeff. How are you?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Area is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good. Good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He. Can you tell me if you guys have a wait list of people that are waiting to be processed as soon as you get this money?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. I'm not sure what the number is to date. But, you know, we have a waitlist right now of about two weeks to three weeks for assistance. And that's just based on on sheer volume. The volume of inquiry we're receiving right now, of course, during this crisis has had has had peaks and valleys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, it's it's not going away. And there are just a lot of people in desperate situations right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How many staff people do you have that are assisting people, processing their request for payments?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've right now we have six individuals who are on the team who are administering rental assistance on behalf through it. We have folks who are just frontline. All they do is try to gather documentation and make sure that everybody is submitting the necessary documents to be able to qualify for the program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have others to just simply facilitate that payment. And then certainly we have a backroom folks who have to process those requests and then others who make sure that the files are up to snuff, they say, and can pass muster just on the compliance side for the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, we've we've really worked to staff up since well, since July. We started talking with the city organizations who had shared concerns about some of our process, as well as members of council, who also expressed concern about just how we were facilitating some of those and some of the backlog.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have worked to address all of that over the past few months. Since May, we've administered more than $1,000,000.7 million in rental assistance on behalf of the program, and we're very proud of that. As you heard from our navigators, you know, they are working on the front lines and, you know, they see and hear and feel the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'stories of really desperate situations that folks are facing on a daily basis. And it really is both a rewarding program, but it's a it's a daunting program. But, you know, that's what coverage does. We're here to help anywhere we can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So those six people, are they actually available on a phone line where somebody is given? So I know a lot of the calls are coming through 311. So when you send somebody over, is there a number they're calling in, you will actually have people answering the phone and are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, telling people what they need, and then there's a place for them to get the applications to you. And we we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, we. We received inquiries. Thank you, gentlemen. We received inquiries via the phone, and we also received them through email. So we have an email you just the email entry in the brothers that gets them back to us and before it goes along.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, we're working on all fronts to do that. We also have a drop site. Our office is closed due to COVID, but we do have we have virtually catered regularly with clients so they can send in all their documentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we think we're addressing the need that exists. Working as hard as diligently as we can to fulfill all those requests for rental assistance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I know we have other organizations doing this in Denver. Are there certain neighborhoods that you all are? I don't know if restricted to is the right way or want to ask this, but targeted to sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. So we we serve essentially the the west side. I always said Broadway is more or less the dividing line. I think that's still true. Listen, I can speak to that more definitively. Now, we we have zip codes just to the west side of town.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then my last question is, what is your turnaround time from the time somebody gets a complete application into you? What's the turnaround time to get a check out? And is that written directly to that landlord as opposed to giving the check directly to the the individual?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Excellent. Abby, speak more definitively to the timeline. You have more information on that? Absolutely. All of payments are made directly to the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Abby, I don't know if you want to add anything more to that. But I think Jeff's Jeff's question was too pretty or answer was helpful. I don't like in there, but no, I'm good. I just wanted to get some of those on the record so that as people are looking to this source of funding, they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'know where they can go. They know they can call 311. Brothers is not the only entity. I know you guys were selected to do some of the state true a program as well and that covers other areas of the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know if any of those dollars were available to Denver residents as well, but I think it's just helpful for the listening public to know what's available to them and how to how to access it. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Torres. Thank you, Madam President. Just a couple of questions to Melissa. So we took action last.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Week to reduce the mortgage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Assistance side, about 500,000. Did all of that go right back into the true a side, the rental side?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So 500, it was a reduction of 800,000. 500 of that went into true. However, that's a different funding source from this contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Coronavirus relief funds. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was my my next question. The relief funds and and have to be extended by the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What's what's true.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is funding come January. What is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That look like? So we had, I think last week or two weeks ago, Northeast Denver Housing Center contracts amended to increase funding and extend into March of next year. And then this additional funding will also be extended into March of next year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The reason for us doing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are on a timeline by which our 2021 notice of funding availability contracts won't be executed by the end of the year. And so as to not have a gap in this program, these will kind of buffer that. And we have sent award letters since the last time I spoke with you all for some of our 2021.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. First so I can say a little over $3 million will be dedicated to two for 2021. Okay. That's great news.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. Thank you, Madam President. All right. Thank you, Councilman. And I didn't have any questions, but I wanted to give Gabriela medina an opportunity to come back up and the queue. Her wife, I froze, and she had an.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Idea that missed opportunity. That is not my connection. The status pregnant though I was the moment of parasitism at LA communication. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Because I don't know what happened. My connection got frozen and I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Apologize for that. But I mean, it's more important that this Esteban Sackett is the most active participant because that extreme adamant, the preoccupied, they must have the cell pockets they've been willing to lose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For me, it's very important to give you this message. This participant was extremely troubled because she was going to be evicted because she couldn't pay for her night.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, this could happen to me. That can be alarming. Amanda suarez when i was takata para las personas. They're standing by credit card. They say that are for large order remembering that they may be infected. Maybe they lose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, my name is yolanda suarez and I am extremely grateful for the people who are making this program available and the people who have helped me pay for my light and gas level.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is to receive that status. And this is an extension of mutual respect for me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I am truly grateful for what you angels are doing for our families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's just another standard tongue twister title. It's not a copy estimator noting from the official on the scene of what for you that the stadium movement. They told us. They thought I couldn't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this COVID has affected us so much in our families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That it could help remove some of. That's what little corazon. Muchas gracias. Organization. Maria Startup agenda at Todos Los Latinos get no Podemos de la Europe. What a chicken Carrillo el presidente de.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From the bottom of my heart. I thank you and I thank everyone who is in the program, who works through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To be able to help all of the Latino community who was not able to receive the stimulus check from the president.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The guitar that are going to be Apollo comedy on the passenger getaway economy in total momentum. CUOMO Well, what about the stress on the killers? And it's the moment the promoter in the photos.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank Gaby, who was there with me during this time that I was that I needed her help. And like, I will repeat once again, you are the angel for angels, for many of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, but I'll you then I'm with Jeff. I mean, that's a symbol for power, for a system that is working against us by this God loving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're just grateful for everything that you're doing. And I also want to say thank you to just consider other families that don't have the funds to continue paying for their rent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There were that the chairman says eradicate in Moscow is the program. I continue to serve with my son most of my days and that this is that we are living in this moment of necessity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is such a high need and we really need the support so that we can help the families that truly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Really, really need it at this time. That's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, thank you. Thank you, Gabriella. And glad that we were able to get that letter read into the record. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1236 is closed. Are there any comments by members of council? Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just a quick one. I want to thank Western Renaissance Collaborative, who has been working on connecting folks directly with through community connectors, residents from Westword who are working with their neighbors to get them signed up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not it's not easy. And I know that Nola and Brendon, who are also working with connector programs in their respective parts of the city, have also been doing similar work, and I thank them for that as well, because the beginning of the pandemic really demonstrated how difficult it was going to be to get families who'",
        "'speaker_2': 'were in desperate need and who had some egregious disparities, particularly with Internet connection and hard copy capacity and a variety of things kind of get through some of those barriers. And I know that working with Kim Desmond's office and the tenacity of the of the host team to get some of those things ironed out is is really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'seeing some, some good outcomes. So I'm grateful to DRC, Mary Reyes, Gaby Medina, Megan Myles and Yolanda for submitting some comments because I think through community connectors, it's one of the ways that this equity divide in West Denver has helped get helping, getting bridged.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you all for that. And I hope to continue to see true of funding levels that we need it. Thank you. Well, thank you, Councilwoman. Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
