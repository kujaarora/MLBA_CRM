        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just had a question as to how the the rules work with regard to contracts, because I think the description that is on the public agenda is incorrect. And I think in the past we've had to refile.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I'm correct. But this approves a contract with softball in Denver for $750,000 and for three years. But in the contract itself, the maximum amount is actually $2,250,000 that we're being asked to approve. And I don't know if that's a just an error because it's that slope.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. Sorry. Sky Stuart. Mayor's office. The descriptions that are provided aren't legal descriptions. So as long as the contract is correct and the legal title is correct, it should be okay. And I don't have a copy of the contract in front of me.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm wondering, what was the basis for the 3% escalation? How confident are we in doing a 21 year agreement and locking in a just a 3% increase annually?'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And I think the answer is no. But I just want to make sure, because the voters just approved an addition to the building section of our code for to add green roofs.
