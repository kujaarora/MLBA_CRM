Our Kennebec Conservation Easement on the RCI property. How can that encumber a completely separate property from vertical construction?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Right. And but if that parcel were sold to someone else, the parking lot, which is not in the conservation easement, could they? And this is related to the amendment because we're redressing the property. I know that's a stretch, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And so it actually has a boundary of where that conservation easement applies, meaning you cannot build something in that area to block that southern facade, but that this property wholly exists outside of that boundary. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. It does, however, say in the conservation easement that they can't build on adjacent properties. I think Section 3.1 of that easement doesn't permit RTI to build on anything adjacent that is not specifically described in the legal description.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would prohibit them from from building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. So then the but there is existing CMCs five zoning unencumbered by height. And so the contract with RTI says that it should be sold for the appraised value, but it was appraised with encumbrances that don't exist. Is that correct?'",

        "'speaker_10': 'educational facilities and institutions. More flexibility to accommodate changing demographics and encouraging investment in neighborhoods and community facilities. In terms of Blueprint Denver This area is a single family area of stability and it's also on a residential collector street and near an enhanced transit corridor, which is Federal Boulevard.'",

But one of the strategies to preserve existing character is to encourage reinvestment in stagnant commercial centers or other areas where reinvestment would be desirable to make the surrounding neighborhood more attractive and stable.'",

In addition, residential neighborhoods, according to Blueprint, Denver call for not only residential land use, but also complementary nonresidential land uses such as small shops, parks, schools and cultural amenities such as churches and other services for residents.'",

The proposal is also consistent with the neighborhood context and the zoned district purpose and intent. So this MPI to district was specifically written and designed to be applied to smaller and medium scale campus sites that are located adjacent to single unit two unit townhouse and other'",

And the proposed zoned districts use regulations standards for height, height, step backs, building coverage and setbacks are designed to be compatible with the existing homes at this location.'",

They do very positive work in the neighborhood. They're inclusive and welcoming to Catholics and non-Catholics alike alike.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Handprint Architects. For the past eight months, I've seen a lot of development in West Highlands over the 30 years that I've lived here, but I've never seen a development that sought neighborhood involvement early in the process, as this project has.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This reasoning should be used as a model for how rezoning should take place. St Dominic's Priory came to the West Highland Neighborhood Association meeting last winter and explained what their long range plans was for this site and asked for input on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A neighborhood advisory group was formed with the West Highlands Neighborhood Association. This was like Citizens Group representative from historic Denver and several Prairie members who had been meeting for the past six months. We were invited to attend the Resource Rezoning Pre-Application meeting with CPD at every stage that follows.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also, the project and the rezoning was presented to CPD. CPD recommended that this rezoning not be Miss three but simply eye to the Hamparian Denver team. The priorities of the R.A. representatives agreed to that zoning was the best fit for the neighborhood in this area of one and two story homes Zone two, unit and single family residence'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The heights of the new buildings were. The primary concern of the neighborhood. The primaries plans were for a three storey building. The zoning allows more than that. There is some give and take and the end result. Of the current rezoning application and deed restrictions put in place to cap the height three occupied storeys.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is how all zoning and neighborhoods should occur and process come to the neighborhood, work with the neighborhood, have an outcome that is a win win for everyone. I ask you to support this rezoning.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And she writes, As good a project as this is, it is unfortunately revealed a problem with the citywide rezoning that passed over five years ago. Prior to rezoning, immediate neighbors would have received written notice of rezoning, and many in the city believe that was still the case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Unfortunately, right now it isn't, and it created a problem in our neighborhood. We like to think, Councilman Espinosa, for arranging mediation among the neighbors in Saint Dominic's church that has resulted in the Good Neighbor Agreement. We strongly encourage council to reinstitute the requirement for written notification of immediate neighbors in all cases of rezoning.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, that's okay. After me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I figured you probably had a question since it was right. Let's go to Councilman Brooks, the Iranian first. Councilman Espinoza and then. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Kyle, can you. Can I ask you a question? This is kind of a larger question, and it will not be the last time I ask it, because we're going to start to see a lot of these throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm wondering, is on a macro level for this city, is CPD beginning to look at customization of zoning of churches within single family neighborhoods? This is a great example of something that worked well, but we have many examples of contentious rezonings of churches in neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's coming up more and more. So I'm just wondering if you guys have taken a look at scope back to to start to do some customization. Zoning. Sure. So I'm Kyle Dalton with the Department of Community Planning and Development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More specifically, we've seen a pattern of rezoning requests over the past couple of years in relation to both places a religious assembly, but also other civic institutions that are experiencing in some cases, decay and in some cases growth.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're finding that that we have to look at them on a state by state basis to see what kinds of zoning solutions are necessary. In many cases, there are standards on districts available, like in this case on the books that will satisfy the needs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in other cases, we've had to look to custom zoning options that that sometimes are what it really just depends on what the plan direction is, what's going on. But at a broader level, we see that there's this trend that we want to look at as a city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we've suggested that this be a topic that we look at during the Blueprint Denver's citywide plan update next year. Perfect. Perfect. I'm glad that it's going to be on the docket on a larger deal. You know, I think as for us, the city council and a lot of heartache for the community, it's a lot of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'heartache and for you are CBD. And if we can get an agreed upon plan of principles of how we kind of go through the zoning, I think that would be very helpful. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Espinoza.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kyle, don't go away. Yeah. Hey, Tim. Got it, Kyle. And here's where I. Now I'm going to screw up. Is it did you. My understanding is you came to Denver from a similar type of department in Phenix. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or is that somebody else? My colleague did. See, I told you I was going to screw it up. I think I would like to speak to your colleague.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And almost got out of that one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. What were the notification requirements in Phenix on rezonings?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So in Phenix it was a little different. They do do mailing notifications to a radius surrounding the subject property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I just I thought I understood that about Phenix and I wanted that said because it came up and I don't I would like to encourage counsel to consider that putting that back into our requirements. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Rose. I just would like to make a comment about the good neighbor agreements that I just really want to commend CPD and Councilman Espinosa and and all the neighbors for working out and developing this good neighbor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I see these agreements working in contentious situations, but also in very favorable situations where you have a documented discussion about what the uses and issues are with the age of the rezoning. So I just really want to commend CPD for going forward on this and I hope this will be a this mediation and good development, good neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_8': 'agreements will be something that will be adopted in continuing rezonings in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Are there any other questions from council? All right. Public hearing is closed. Comments by members of council and Councilman Espinoza.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. So first off, Tom, Brian, great pen. I really like that. So tell me where I can get one. And he's not paying attention. Okay, Tom, I just said a great pen. I like it on your shirt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my brief comments are going to do this. Justice would mean do justice what it took to get here. Whether you think it was three months or eight months, it was still a long process. But when you come in to this dais and you see nothing but support on the monitor, I it feels like from district one'",
        "'speaker_5': ', it feels like I'm in the twilight zone. So I swear Rod Serling is going to meet me out in the corridor. But listening, finding compromise and agreeing on language which allows both the developer and the community to move forward together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The fact that all speakers were in support on a sizable District one rezoning prove that it can be done. It starts with meaningful communication, and I think I speak for many involved when I say I deeply appreciate all of your hard work and willingness to dialog.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you all. Oh. And I encourage my colleagues to to approve this rezoning. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Are there any other comments from members of the council? Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to clarify one point that was raised by one of the speakers, Jack Youngblood. She asked that we ensure that notification of the registered neighborhood notice registered neighborhood organizations continue to be a practice unreasoning. And that is, in fact, one of the stipulations of the registered neighborhood notification ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My predecessor, Sal Carpio, was the author of that legislation, and there were a number of things that the ordinance required notification to neighborhoods on in rezoning applications or in fact, one of those. And if a city attorney could just nut his head, this has not been changed since then, to do my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is it, in fact, correct that this continues to be one of the notifications that neighborhoods receive?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'David Broadwell again, notification r and o's has taken consistent through the years. I think the comment made earlier was direct mail notification to adjacent neighbors. And I honestly, I think though the word that was used was reinstate or I'm not familiar with whether we ever did that in the past or when that might have changed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think that's the point the speaker was making, in addition to her now notification, advocating a system for direct notification of neighbors in writing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you for that clarification. It's not my understanding that there has ever been direct notification by the city to all of the adjacent property owners. That has typically been the responsibility of the developer that is proposing a project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you, Mr. President. I will be supporting this application today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Espinosa, is that okay if I go to Councilman Cashman first and then come back or do you have an answer?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, no. I was just going to make that clarification that why don't you let Jackie, who is was talking about, was direct notification of adjacent property owners. And the rule that we used to have is within the 200 foot halo on rezonings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then that any requirement for that when it was and it was specific conditions was stripped in the 2010 legislative Rizzo. Nope. Okay. I stand corrected. Oh, Kyle. Looks like you can speak to one question. Thanks for the opportunity to correct the record here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kyle Dalton Again with CPD and previous to 2010 and former Chapter 59, there was not a requirement to provide direct mail notification. The only thing that changed about notification from the old code to the new code was the addition of of another hour and no notice at the time of complete application, which was not required before.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Other than that, there was no change to the notification requirements. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just couldn't let this go by without saying how absolutely thrilled I am to see a property owner work so openly with a community to arrive at a solution. And I don't believe you have to be a church to show that type of respect and compassion to the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've sat here in recent weeks and had examples of half hearted efforts by one developer and a complete disrespect for the community shown by another. And I think I don't think a landowner is obligated to do everything that a community asks them to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think a landowner is is morally obligated to engage in an open dialog in an attempt to create a win win situation. I think there are places where private property rights and community property rights come together, and I think it's been a fabulous example of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just want to take my hat off to my colleague, Councilman Espinosa, for the role he played and certainly to to the church and the community for the time they invested in this. Thank you all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Kenny.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am I, too, want to thank all the speakers tonight for their thoughtful work and for sharing their support for this project and will be voting in support of it. I did just think it might be helpful, though, to chime in, since I imagine members of the public are a little confused.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've got some folks saying there was notice happening and the staff confirming that there wasn't. What I wonder if some of the members of the public might be thinking of is the Zipkin zoning plan informational notice. There are certain types of requests for oversight fences or other types of things, some home occupations that require an informational notice'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that goes to people. And it might have been a you might still be, I would assume is still the same amount of distance as it was in the prior code. So folks may have thought that that meant that all zoning things were notice to neighbors, and that's not the case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if you're feeling like, hey, I know I've gotten a notice before, I've heard of notices before, you probably have. But it wasn't a rezoning notice. It was probably an informational notice for a certain category of probably what I would consider lesser changes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Kyle can certainly step up and correct me if I'm wrong, but I just want to affirm for people who think they've seen and heard of such notices, they do exist but also affirm the staff that that's very different than notice for a rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just to help clarify that, Rick, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, and I'm supportive of this. This is great. I wanted to speak on this notice piece again further clarifying with councilman can each that the department when you're doing a legislative rezoning when one of us as council members do a legislative rezoning, they actually encourage you to send a letter to every house that's impacted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know our office has done that. Five Voice Business Association has done that. So there may be further confusion there. And I also know that if a home is doing a pop up or things like that, they require to notice the adjacent house front and back as well with the letter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so there's a lot of confusion around the rezoning stuff, but I am so supportive and so, so great to see you all come together and agree on this rezoning. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Any other comments, Councilman Espinoza?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks, for that best practice. I appreciate that. And I'm going to commit to District one from now on when I get rezonings. Until we have a law, I will notify my neighbors that are impacted. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Can't any more. All right. I wanted to chime in and say that I'm impressed with the process and I'm impressed at how smooth this has gone. And also, I just you know, I my daughter attended the school just north, and it's quite a catalog of such a long time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And to see the level at which you participate in the community and what different community events and everybody use in your your parking lot, I mean, it's probably the only parking lot I know out there. I know that you guys are great players and you have a great choir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So hats off to the process. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa, for your work on the ground. And thank you, folks, for making this a smooth process. With that, Madame Secretary, if we have a roll call on Council Bill 775.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Espinosa I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Flynn, I. Gilmore, I. Cashman. I can h. I knew Ortega. I. Susman. Black Brooks II. Clark, I. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I. Madam Secretary, please announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_4': '11 Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_1': '11 Eyes Council Bill 775 has passed saying that there's no other business before this body. Today, this meeting is adjourned. Everybody drives safe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Denver eight TV. Your city, your source.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver eight on TV and online to stay connected to your community, your city, your source.'"
