        "'speaker_2': 'I stand here today in support of the proposed tiff for ninth in Colorado with some brief comments. First of all, I want to thank Councilwoman Sussman and Councilwoman Robb for their tireless support of the neighborhood surrounding ninth and Colorado Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Their leadership on this issue was pivotal, both pivotal to getting the redevelopment back on a productive track. I also want to share my appreciation for Steve Zack Bonner for managing the process that resulted in the selection of Continuum Partners after a somewhat contentious period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Did my opinion ultimately do right by the neighborhood as we move forward? I would like to ask that the City Council work with the developer and with the surrounding neighborhoods to minimize the impact of cut through traffic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many of the mitigations that are required are beyond the bounds of the actual development. And so I ask that we continue to partner that with an eye towards the safety of the children who live and play in the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the additional foot traffic that I expect as people walk to the new development as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we move forward. It's my hope and expectation that Continuum Partners will continue to pursue the Do It Right and ninth neighborhood vision focused on placemaking with local businesses, especially small businesses with green spaces and a charming new urban neighborhood that includes affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The bones of this are already reflected in the evolving site plan, but we'll obviously want to watch carefully as the details emerge. I think Frank Cannon and continuing partners for their excellent community outreach and effective partnering and look forward to more of the same as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that there's no question that the Ninth and Colorado development needs to proceed and continue in partners is when my confidence is the right development for this project. So I urge the City Council to approve the proposed tiff for this project because it cannot proceed without it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Maria Valdez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, dear city leaders. I'm a little shorter. I want to thank you for considering this tonight. And I want to express my support over the years that I've lived in the neighborhood. We moved there because of the hospital and because of the health needs of our daughter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And over the years that I've lived there, we've gone through waves. We went through waves of hospital encroachment into the neighborhoods, the waves of. White flight to the suburbs. We went through waves of many, many types. But this one seems to be right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Seems like the right time. The economy's good.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our neighborhood is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Strong and vibrant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Bellevue Hill seems to be a very desirable place to live right now. And I'm sure glad since that's where I live. We've gone through years of hope, followed by dashed hope, and finally, I think followed by faith that this will be a good result.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There have been thoughtful interactions with us as neighbors and with other neighborhood groups, and the outreach has been heartfelt and sincere. We believe and we feel that this will only help make our strong, vibrant neighborhood stronger. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Lori Bogue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've got to move this back up just a little bit. Good evening, Mr. President, and members of City Council. My name is Lori Bogue. I live at 1200 Ash Street. I've served this past year as the interim vice chair of the Colorado Boulevard Health Care District, and also for the past three years have been the president'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the Bellevue Hill Neighborhood Association. As you know, the Ninth and Colorado Redevelopment Project sits wholly within the boundaries of Bellevue Hill. We're a strong and engaged neighborhood, a vibrant community. And during the past ten years, we have collectively held our breath as we dealt with the uncertainty of what was to become of this site, often wondering'",
        "'speaker_5': 'if we would actually see any development come to fruition. This past year, we were pleased when the project began to move forward. When Frank Cannon and the Continuum team came on board, Frank and his team have engaged in a constructive, positive program of community outreach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And throughout the past year, they have listened to our concerns on issues from street grid configuration to pedestrian accessibility to vehicular traffic patterns. And they have made modifications to their plans to accommodate our concerns. These conversations continue today and we look forward to their continuing during the coming months and years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want to express our appreciation for the manner in which Continuum has conducted the community outreach. We would also like to thank Steve Zack BRAWNER from the university and Councilwoman Sussman and Rob for their tireless efforts in keeping this project moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And at this point, I would like to urge you to stand to to support Council Bill 1015 and allow this project to continue to move forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers for 1015. Time for questions from members of council. All right. We have no questions from council. So the public hearing on 1015 is closed now. Time for comments from members of Council Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Am happy to. Happy to go first. Although my partner, Councilwoman Robb, has been with this project almost as long, I think I heard from Tracy that the original GDP was 1999 before the turn of the century.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you think about that. And so I know that my partner Will Castle and Rob will be have lots to talk about in all those years. Certainly it's something that I worked worked on since becoming council member, but so grateful to have council having Rob's experience on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's also wonderful to see the leadership of our neighborhoods and this neighborhoods surrounding the ninth in Colorado and these many of these people are in this audience are people I see every week, because that's the kind of work that they have put in on this project and how much they care and and how closely we have work'",
        "'speaker_6': 'together as a neighborhood, as a community to really make a good project here. Very, very happy to have them here tonight. And I want to thank the CEO leadership as well. We've gotten to know each other pretty well, too, over the last four years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it is it's a project that has taken a lot of leadership and a lot of followership as well. I particularly want to end on the notion that if you are going to to develop or imagine buildings, I would very much suggest Rice Krispies as your building blocks, because when you get frustrated, you can eat the buildings'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and if you if you want to. And I enjoyed the children's workshop that you provided. I've enjoyed the outreach that the Continuum Partners have done, as you heard from the leadership about this project. So look forward to going forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It particularly like the notion that tax increment financing here, you can't create the percentage of tax increment that there is because it starts with zero. There were no tax returns on this particular piece of property. So all of the increment is from a base of zero.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I urge my fellow colleagues to support this request.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilman Roman Sussman, for reminding me how long I've worked on this, or at least been around in Steve, just like you. I don't look a day older, even if it's ten years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually, I think the first thing I want to say is we had some rough times throughout those ten years, some very disappointing times, some shock. And without mentioning any names, I will say that the former proposals had this weird silver lining of crystallizing what the neighborhood really wanted on the site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was very clear from the neighborhood that was just the time that Councilwoman Sussman was coming on council. We heard that message, and I think we really were able to enunciate the vision very clearly. And then the stars aligned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, when we first were very worried about it, we thought, who's out there in this economy? Well, gradually the economy came around, our vision crystallized, and folks like Continuum were listening. I also wanted to talk about Continuum a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I, I really think it's rare, I have to say this, that you have a public hearing at council and you hear how much faith the people who talk have in the development team. So you have a lot to live up to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I have been in meetings with Frank Cannon, most notably one on affordable housing that's just off the site but will be part of the overall project. And very important, when you're developing an area like this and Frank Cannon's ability to listen and repeat what he heard until he got it exactly right, I could take lessons.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of the other things that I think are great in this project is you may remember that the former children's center there, this was demolished, but the panels have been saved and some may be able to be incorporated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've already mentioned the meeting on affordable housing. I think the continuum is overachieving in the park. Which is good. We all appreciate that. And the children's workshop. And by the way, my grandson went and he was more interested in eating than in building anything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Even though I drove him around it under the bridge, I kept saying, Look at this building. That's a bridge. You should study these buildings. Who knows, maybe 20 years from now. But I think what it really said to me to have a children's workshop is that cities are places for children, too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that is very important that our development community realize that we need to have family friendly development. That doesn't mean that it can't have some density, but that it's an important place for people of all sizes and ages.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's see. Finally, I guess I wanted to say that I really enjoy working with the Bellevue Hill neighborhood. That's not to call out favorites. That's not what I'm saying at all. But every neighborhood in this process has worked with a positive attitude, despite the disappointments you might remember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it was a national Jewish rezoning. When Bellevue Hill was here, they weren't absolutely 100% happy, but they realized it was the future. They realized the importance of the hospital and they wanted to work on it. And that's the attitude that I have seen there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it's it's amazing, a little rare sometimes, but appreciate it. And also then I just want to say it's been really good to work with Councilwoman Sussman on it. She constantly said, we need more beds, more heads on this site, we need more people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, it's any time in my experience, I'd council, I guess I'm getting old enough even though I'm not that much older. But I've been getting old enough to reflect on my experience. It really is wonderful, whether it's Albert Brooks, Albert Wedgeworth, Carla Madison that I've worked with on Colfax or in this case, Councilwoman Sussman, to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have a good partner in crime to bounce your ideas off of as you strive to do the best you can for the people you're representing, I think is is really part of the stars aligning in this project. So thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Bring it on. I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have spoken a number of times against ordinances. It's a pleasure to be able to speak about one that I'm going to support the bill. Before this last election, I really did a lot of thinking about what I considered that the city needed to do, and there were about four projects that to me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'were so imperative that it just absolutely had to be done. And this is one that was at the top of the list, not in my district. None of them were in my district. But in trying to make a city better, this seemed to be absolutely crucial.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If there's a big hole right now and you just cannot leave it that way, it is certainly something that meets the definition of blight. There's no question about whether it should be a redevelopment in my mind. And in fact, my involvement goes back even more than ten years because I served in the legislature at the time that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it was decided to move the medical facilities to the What's now Anschutz Campus. So it was clear that something was coming and something needed to be done. And I thought, Gee, developers will rush in and do it well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All these years later, it is clear that the but for requirement, which is a way that you measure whether urban renewal ought to be in an area if the developers are going to come in and do it themselves, that's that's the best plan of all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it's been sitting there years and years and years and years, and there was a gap for funding, which also was affecting another institution I care about greatly, the University of Colorado having dealt with that for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it just all came together, I believe, finally with this proposal. And one other thing I think that needs to be mentioned. You're talking about the council. Sussman was dealing with the zero tax that we get right now under this proposal, at least, I think we're getting 300,000 a year into the city to help cover city services'",
        "'speaker_3': ', and that is going to be a real plus even during the increment period. So this is one that I believe we need to get on with. I'm delighted that we have people here who are interested and supportive, and although I have probably opposed about half of the tips that have come before me not feeling they were well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'structured. This one, I think is and deserves support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Thoughts? Any other comments on 1015? Seeing none, Mr. Secretary. Roll call. BROWN Hi. But I can each layman. Lopez. Montero. Nevitt Hi. Ortega. Rob Shepherd. Sussman. Hi, Mr. President. Hi, Mr. Secretary. Please close the vote in the results.'"

My name is Andrew Johnson with the Department of Finance Manager of Financial Development, giving you the staff report for the Council Bill 1034 before you today, which approves the service plans of the Ninth Avenue Metropolitan Districts numbers one, two and three.'",

The development plans for the Ninth Avenue metropolitan districts are being submitted for City Council approval on behalf of Ninth Avenue Venture LLC, pursuant to the requirements of the Special District Control Act.'",

However, this district is anticipated that it will be dissolved upon the approval of the proposed metropolitan districts to ensure no duplication of services will exist.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The boundaries of the districts will eventually encompass 26 acres located approximately three miles southeast of downtown Denver Central Business District. The boundaries of the district are generally east of Colorado Boulevard, north of Eighth Avenue, south of 11th Avenue and west of Bellaire Street.'",

The development plans calls for a combination of residential, commercial and retail development.'",

Thank you for your prior votes with regard to the Metropolitan District, once we build this great new neighborhood, we need a way to maintain it and make sure that it is a viable, vibrant neighborhood for many years to come, which is really the reason'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and the purpose of the metropolitan districts. We need to be able to maintain the public spaces, the back of curb improvements we build for sidewalks and pedestrian environments that really make this a great neighborhood asset for us. So it's really the purpose of that.'",

And I've been attending the public meetings hosted by Continuum all of this time. And finally, they're they're the ones that really get it, have it together, I should say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Continuum has been a significant, incredible developer in the suburbs and within the city. They have also had been have been have a financially strong partner out of California. And they have been sensitive to the neighbors concerns and vision so far.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I feel there's a relatively comfortable feeling that continuum will compliment the neighbors thoughts and vision. I trust they will continue on the right path, especially how it impacts traffic. I therefore encourage you to pass this bill as you have already passed the first one.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I do have some questions. Just for clarification, I think I know the answers. Andrew, you mentioned very briefly, but we did have a metropolitan district before and we're dissolving that because that was a placeholder, as I recall.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have there is a business improvement district, not a metropolitan not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A metropolitan special district. Right. That's all right. Thank you for that clarification. And I promise I should know the answer to this one. But why three districts and not one?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of times it's a it's a strategic move by in order to allow for different styles of development, whether you have commercial or residential, you might need to have different services provided to these different localities within the development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So perhaps you might activate one and in one area, one another, one in another area. That's one of the reasons that you would have multiple districts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you might have different people serving on these districts given whoever is within that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is correct. The board of directors that serves the Metropolitan District of operations is made up of the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Let me take there is anyone and it'll go to a vote on November 15th. The passes this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If it passes this evening, then the there will be a creation election in November of 2015 is the plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're welcome.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I feel like a clone. I had basically the same question in my. Let me just say, how are we disbanding the bid? Is that part of this ordinance? Is it part of. I don't think it's part of the vote, but do the property owners in the bid have to vote to disband it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm just remembering.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the bid is not being dissolved as part of this ordinance. We you may have remember that earlier this year we created the Santa Fe bid, our business improvement district, which involved the dissolution of maintenance districts that were currently there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're not doing a combination in the ordinance like we did there. What we're doing is we're just creating or creating or authorizing the service plans to this evening and sometime during the course of next year, we will come back through and AV, I believe the process would be actually coming here and passing an ordinance that says'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's no outstanding obligations, there's no debt outstanding, and thus this district can be dissolved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then I went through the service plans. But how much flexibility is there in the service plan? Can a metropolitan you know, I looked at the parks and rec and the roads and the things that were listed there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But can the metropolitan district take on lighting, safety issues, even some retail promotion, which is a job of bids?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But so the construction operations for metropolitan districts as a whole can do almost everything except for what the last thing was, which is marketing. The metropolitan district is really geared for infrastructure and maintenance of that infrastructure as long as it's within the public right of way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that is the core concept of metropolitan districts for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Robb, are there any other questions from members of council? Scene nine public hearing on 1034 is been closed now. Time for comments. I'll start with Councilman Robb. If you have any sense hearing it.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I was trying to make Larry feel better. I, too, should have chimed in on the prior bill, but I was just enjoying listening to the dialog that I missed my window. So I wanted to just call out my colleagues for their leadership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sometimes you don't know what you can get without saying no. First, it's a very scary position to be in, but they were among the folks on council who led the way in giving us this opportunity. And then in terms of the affordable housing, I wanted to first thank Dora and the university because when we approved the urban'",
        "'speaker_4': 'renewal area, we had a pretty vibrant conversation about affordable housing from this dais. And I feel that you all heard that. And before even the competition happened for this second round and this parcel, I believe that you made this a part of the request in a part of the conversation and opened those doors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I appreciate your responsiveness to this council and then continuum, obviously, for walking through the door. I have not been in the meetings by an air stand. There's been dialog with the community about that and I think senior housing is a great opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also have, as you said, a city where children live. And so I hope that housing for families with children continues to be considered as an opportunity for this site. But regardless, I'm very happy and pleased at the responsiveness in the dialog about that issue because we do have folks who will be working at the grocery stores'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the restaurants will have folks who age out in the neighborhood and maybe want a little less yard and house to take care of, maybe interested in the higher density housing. And so I believe the intergenerational and or the mixed income aspects of this are really something to be proud of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to thank you as well as for these wonderful metropolitan districts to take care of all the infrastructure. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Counsel. Any other comments on 1034 seen on Mr. Secretary? Raquel Lopez Hi, Montero. Nevitt Hi, Rob. Hi, Shepherd. Hi.'",
