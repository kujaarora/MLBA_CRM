If we acquire as anticipated easements, then the remaining interest would remain with Clayton. And if it was a temporary easement after the duration of our temporary easement expires, full title would revert to Clayton.'",

The first one, going back to the six penalties, I thought those were specific in terms of timelines were tied to having the Globeville landing outfall in place by certain deadlines, that it wasn't as much tied to the Park Hill golf course acquisition'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and improvements that are needed there, because we're not going to even begin to get to the improvements until some time, I'm assuming, in 2018 or so. So correct me if I'm wrong there.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Since I've.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reviewed it, and so I would have to get back to you. But my understanding is there are dates into 2019 and potentially beyond for certain elements of the program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But acquiring what we need for the. Drainage that needs to be done at that far northeast corner of the Park Hill golf course. I guess I'm struggling with the fact that we had identified somewhere in the ballpark of 20 acres when this overall project was brought to us back, what, two and a half years ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't understand how it is that we now need 90 acres. That doesn't make sense to me. We should be looking at what we actually need. And I'm just questioning whether this is, you know, kind of getting back and tying us into the conversation about the acquisition of the golf course from Clinton Land Trust.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is just the first phase of that. So, you know, I mean, in the interest of transparency, it's why I asked for the budget of the overall project of all four of these to ensure that, you know, because if we're buying 90 acres versus 20 acres, doesn't that put our budget out of kilter?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, so I appreciate the fact that Councilman Espinosa has postponed that other one for a week so we could try to get that budget information. But help me understand whether or not we actually received the information on the title when we did the conservation easement back in the 2000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Did we not get that? How would that have been have changed since then?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, stats and I want to change on a daily basis. I'm sorry to interrupt you. I wanted to let you know that Steinberg is right behind you, too, as well, because I know you guys are probably yeah, you guys are a team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but certainly there was a title there was a title examination that happened back in the year 2000. And there have been examinations that have happened since then. The city doesn't control the day to day happenings on that course it's that's those rights are owned by Clayton and so what might have happened to title between 2000 and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'today is unknown.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And and Jeff, I saw you want to jump in there? Is there anything that you wanted to say to that exchange? Before I go to Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If there's further clarification, I'm happy to give it. If the answer satisfactory, then. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. I'm good. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Herndon. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm just going to point out that this census bill for introduction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're going to have the opportunity to hear from.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The public and go through questions and comments in two weeks. So I felt as if it was a little redundant to kind of dove into that now. But I was just going to speak on the amendment that Councilman Flynn offered.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I walked up here and I see this sheet of paper on my desk without having any understanding behind it or any conversations with Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Something that I'm comfortable doing right now. I certainly think there are unintended consequences when we try to get involved in the weeds. And so I would hope that my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would vote down the amendment so when we could have the opportunity to hear a little bit more of the reasons behind it on second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Reading next year. Thank you, President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Next year. That is correct. All right. Councilman Herndon, Councilman Flynn, I'm going to skip you and get to some of the folks who have not gotten a go yet. Councilman Espinosa, have you gone yet? No. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Espinosa. So to me, it seems pretty self-evident that the per the intent behind the the amendment was to continue to keep council somewhere somewhat engaged in the process of land, take down acquisition over in the golf course the Park Hill golf course in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I a why would you ever want to remove council when council is asking for that? I don't understand it because we're that much closer to the constituents that we all serve. I would I would like you to confirm what I was shown in the briefing, though.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was presented a a layout that shows a restoration of a fully regulation compliant 18 hole golf course. Is that true?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is true.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I want it on record that we can in fact accommodate the storm water needs that we're attempting to put in and restore a fully regulation compliant 18 hole golf course. That's correct. Okay. So then what is the delay?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How many hell how long does it take for a bill to be filing for you guys to file something for council consideration and it of approved. I'm not sure. What type of bill are you referring to? A land acquisition ordinance bill or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. So the process from the decision to acquire a real estate interest. No, I'm not talking about the decision to acquire. Once you finally decided announcement. Just when the sky's right here. I mean, it's got I don't know if you can just real quick so I don't not interested in the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to know exactly once you decide to go to council. When we how long does it take from the time you file to us taking action?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, a lot of that depends on the action. Sky Stuart Mayor's office. A lot of that depends on the actions you take. If everything goes on a normal course of action, it take five weeks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Five weeks? Well, we could do it in as fast as two weeks. Is that not correct? Or three?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would assume filing things out of order and taking actions that are not the normal process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. But when you say up to five weeks, you're including the entire 30 day or. No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's seven week or an eight week delay. Correct. So my point is, is that I actually have a ton of confidence in the team that is working on this. Both yourselves, Jeff's office and every and public works that they're looking at this very comprehensively and have a very stout understanding, especially at the seam a contract goes through'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I think there's also ample time for everyone to proceed with design and recognize any sort of concerns about land use issues. The process that you would have to undertake to acquire land and to do all that, most of that would occur regardless of whether you actually filed something for council or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is the same process. Legal process that you have to do to acquire land doesn't change just because you have to go to council. The only difference that results from this amendment is that it does come to council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And yes, does that create a pocket of uncertainty because council then could in fact deny the request? Yes, but I think that I think that you either have a I have the confidence that you're either making that decision and you won't come to that point where council would be in a situation where they wouldn't approve it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I don't think there's any real risk because we're ultimately all on the same team here regarding stormwater needs and open space needs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, Councilman, the risk would come back to this if there had to be a new filing of a land acquisition ordinance. It would start the entire process over again in terms of providing notifications of intent to the operator or the owner of the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would entail acquiring a new appraisal. And generally speaking, from the point that a land acquisition is put into place until the complete acquisition process is completed is 12 months. So if there were a delay and let's say it was three, five, six months into the process when design was further along and there was an anticipated outcome'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of what exactly was needed, in addition to a determination of how was to be taken, if we had to go back and file land acquisition ordinance, we'd have to start the entire process over again. And it would add between a six and nine month delay to the construction of this aspect of the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just the thing that I struggle with in your response is this is this sort of concerns that are being addressed by such an amendment are in fact, in part due to the original land acquisition deal that was being struck with with Clayton regarding the entirety of the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And at that time at Safe House, I asked you specifically if if you had seen the if you had either performed, had an appraisal performed or seen the appraisal that Clayton had done. And you confirmed in that meeting that you had not and you did not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this is sort.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of not conducted an.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Appraisal, right? So it's difficult for me that you would be willing to move forward on that deal and then now here say that it would be it would be prohibitive for us to put in this thing, because you'd have to go through that entire process to to acquire land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My expectation is that you would be doing that on any land that we're looking to acquire. And so I now I'm even more in of the opinion that we should be we should be putting this in here so that we actually go through the full vetting process on whether or not we should take down additional land as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it comes up in this situation. So, you know, I just it is a very complicated bit of moving parts. And so I'm glad that we're actually postponing it for a public hearing till next year. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. President, can I offer a clarification? You got not a comment or question just to clarify some of the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Two people. My amendment includes the provision provided that the authority is hereby given to acquire lesser portions of the property in fee, simple as may be necessary or desirable to provide for the project. So a lot of the answers that are being offered here about having to start all over are not entirely accurate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm afraid that the answers are kind of poisoning the intent of my. Okay, my amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Well, let's make sure we get to all the members of council and you can go back and clarify that. Councilwoman Black, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. A lot of my questions were just answered. So thank you. For those of you who came up to the microphone. Like others have said, I'd really like to have a full discussion about that. I don't feel comfortable with that, really delving into any unintended consequences that might be associated with this so we can learn more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about it the next few weeks. That would be my preference.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Unfortunately, we are in the weeds, so I'm just going to stay there for a moment. John, I'm going to ask you so if I understand the premise of Councilman Flynn's amendment. The premise is he's trying to protect against the city, purchasing the entire property, exceeding what is needed for the drainage project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't read the ordinance as me allowing for that as written, so I just want to go to section three of the ordinance. Do you have it in front of you?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, but I'm familiar with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So it says that they they determine that the interest in the property is required for the following public uses and purposes to construct, locate. And it's all about the drainage projects. So I just want to clarify under that language of the section three of this bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could the city legally acquire anything beyond what's needed for that section three anyway?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not under that language of the ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. Okay. And then I just want to ask Kirsten. I don't know if you have the language in front of you, whether you concur or if you haven't had time to review it. That's an understandable answer as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But just do you concur that Section three operates as a limitation on what the city can buy? Excuse me. So in talking with Mr. McGrath and I have to defer to him on this, that that section was added specifically to address that concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my understanding from also speaking with Councilman Flynn is he just wanted to make it more transparent and clear. So I have to defer to Mr. McGrath on this. So, yeah, and I apologize. I try to use a light touch when I when I'm thinking with my lawyer brain because I don't practice law in the same way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that you do. But I think this is one of those areas that when you're writing policy and you're writing something like you're regulating the public, I think it's okay to sometimes dumb down the language and try to make it even doubly clear for the public to understand what you're doing, even if you're legally covered with the language'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that you have that's drafted by a lawyer. I don't feel that way about contracts. Right. So here's the thing. And this is this is why. So if we somehow fail to pass this amendment or there is some problem, the fact that we had done so might make someone interpret this agreement more broadly than it was written.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right? So you can actually change the interpretation of other sections of the agreement once you start tinkering with the language. And so I just I believe that the current language currently limits the city. And so I don't think it's a good practice to dumb down language.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't mean that as a pejorative. I just meant putting it in plainer words. Right. To just be clear, I don't mean that as a pejorative term, but I just that is that in my mind is not good, you know, contractual writing that if the ordinance has already limited my repeating it in different language only creates'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the potential for more confusion and a potential for a court or someone down the road. And clearly, we do have challenges floating around in this environment, so I don't want there to be any confusion. So I'm going to go on the record and say this current bill, as written, already completely prohibits the city from buying any land'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that isn't needed for drainage period. And so I stand by that language. I assert it in there. You know, in the record, the attorneys have now asserted it on the record, which makes the amendment risky and creating confusion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's that's my so I think I share Councilman Flynn's good intentions and his intent, but I fear the unintended consequences of duplicating, but with different words, something that's already covered under the way. The whole agreement is structured. So I will be voting no on that basis tonight, but I understand the good intentions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Kenney. Each new passes. Flynn, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. I thought I thought Councilman New was in. There are some other unintended consequences. And one of them is. And first of all, I apologize to all my colleagues I wasn't able to reach yet. But when I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I saw I was reading this on Friday night, we had some weekend email exchanges and the amendment was actually only drafted at about 3:00 or 330 this afternoon. And I didn't have a chance to talk to everybody, but I was told that if we were going to act on the amendment, it would be better to act on'",
        "'speaker_7': 'it tonight. Because if we were to adopt an amendment on final, it would cause us to have to do republication and delay it by yet another week, which had its own consequences. That's the reason I was pushing it tonight, and for no other reason I would gladly take it on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On January 2nd, after the public hearing, if it were more clear that we wouldn't have to republish it and take it up again a week later. The unintended consequence that I'm trying to avoid is that we told the public a couple of weeks back or a couple of maybe a month and a half ago that we were'",
        "'speaker_7': 'not going to buy the Park Hill golf course. And in this ordinance, it allows us to buy up to 90 acres as long as it's needed for the drainage project. That was always true, but we were told in committee that we were going to do this by permanent easement and buy temporary construction easement and not by purchasing'",
        "'speaker_7': '. But we still, nevertheless, in the amendment, leave in the provision that we may acquire by fee. Simple if that is the necessary way of acquiring the land for the smaller pieces and parcels, lesser portions if they are needed to provide for the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I believe that it is that the objections that were noted by the folks who say they're going to vote no is addressed right in that last that last clause of the amendment, Mr. President. So I would ask for support for this in order to keep faith with what the public has been understanding that we were not'",
        "'speaker_7': 'going to buy the Park Hill golf course at this point. We were just going to get easements. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. The amendment is on the floor right now. We're going to vote on the amendment. Or what? Would you like us to vote on the amendment? Okay, great. Council members, given the debate we are voting.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'It's in the Cole neighborhood, just near the intersection of High Street and 40th Avenue. It's about 8000 square foot property with a single industrial building on the site. And the request here is to rezone from the I.B. Industrial Zone District with the UO to overlay Idaho two to IMX three, and that's industrial neighborhood context mixed use with'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a maximum height of three stories. Zoning nearby includes some recently zoned IMX three with the UO to overlay directly to the west of the subject site. I'd you oh two on properties all around the subject site with some you annex two and PWD and residential zoning further to the south of the site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Existing land uses include heavy industrial and transportation uses freight loading uses to the north of the site, smaller scale industrial and mix of single and multi-unit residential surrounding the subject site. This aerial gives a sense of the scale of buildings in the area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As you can see, it's primarily a 2 to 3 story industrial structures, some turn of the century residential structures, and then, of course, the the intermodal freight facility to the north. This photograph looking to the southeast shows some larger industrial uses to the east of the subject site, including a Coca-Cola bottling plant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These images show the subject site itself. As you can see, it is one industrial building and customer parking. This is the subject site directly across the street that was recently zoned to the I am x three zone district.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The IP. The existing zoning IP is a general industrial district intended for very intense industrial uses. It does have some limitations on retail sales, and that's important for the for this application. In this particular case, the property owner is requesting this zone change.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They are currently using the site for marijuana retail and the EIB's own requires that retail sales are only be permitted if the product sold is actually manufactured or processed somehow on site, which is not occurring with this particular business.'",

Buildings located up at the street active ground floor uses of note for this application does permit standalone retail uses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It also introduces other uses into the industrial context, including residential uses, and is typically intended as a transition between mixed use areas and then higher intensity AI or IP use areas. In terms of process, the first informational notice for this request went out in in late August.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The planning board considered this request on October 18th and recommended approval. The committee considered it on November 7th. And here we are at the council hearing December 18th. There were multiple registered neighborhood organizations that consider this site to be within their their boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And all have been notified of this request. We've not received any comment from RINO's about this request. As you know, to adopt a zone change, the council must find that the request is consistent with these five criteria from the Denver Zoning Code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With regard to the first consistency with adopted plans, there are several plans that impact the site, including the comprehensive plan and blueprint, but also the River North Plan, the Elyria and Swansea and Neighborhood Plan in the 38th and Blake Station area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Height Amendments. In terms of the comprehensive plan, this request does further multiple objectives from the comprehensive plan generally aimed at encouraging redevelopment of the former industrial sites into compact mixed use areas around especially around high quality transit stations where people can live, work and play, meet all their daily needs in one place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is relatively close to the 38th and Blake Station area, as you'll see in subsequent plan slides here. Blueprint Denver calls this area out for a future concept. Land use of mixed use and does identified as an area of change is served by a on designated local and an alley, both of which connect to 40th Avenue, which'",
        "'speaker_9': 'is a mixed use arterial and appropriate to it to handle the type of development development that would occur in the I am x three zone district. The River North Plan recommended a concept land use of industrial mixed use at this site.'",

A neighborhood plan recommended mixed use for this area with a focus on employment and noted that pedestrian access is is key in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this area. And I'll point out that these are relatively small block sizes where the impact zone district is appropriate for calling for a high quality pedestrian environment. And then finally, the 30th and Blake Station area height amendments adopted last year established a set of base and incentive heights for this area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I most of you should be aware by now that Community Planning and Development and Council President Brooks are working on a larger set of zone map amendments and text amendments to establish a set of design and incentive overlays in this area that would implement the 30/30 and Blake stationary height amendments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This request came in a little bit early. You'll be hearing the larger rezoning case beginning early next year. But this case came in a little bit early on on the request of the owner to to address the mismatch between the land use and the between the zoning and the land use on the site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'However, it's want to point out that this request is consistent with the recommendations of the 38th and Blake stationary height amendments and would establish the appropriate base height for this site. With regard to the other criteria, this request is consistent with the requirement that it result in the uniform application of district regulations that will result in the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'uniform application of regulations for the IMX three zone district. It will further the public health, safety and welfare by adopting or implementing adopted plans for creating walkable, mixed use, compact development, near high quality transit. The property owner proposed the changed community conditions as their justifying circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Here to meet criteria number four and staff generally agrees that there has been a lot of new development and redevelopment activity in the River North area, especially since the opening of the University of Colorado Airline Station last year.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'My name is Chairman Sekou from the organized the Black Star action movie of self-defense advocacy for poor, working, poor, homeless senior citizens. We support the zoning ordinance and change. And it's a wonderful thing to have this area developed and also given folks options as to how they can go about doing that process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's a caveat to this. Oh. Explosion and expansion of marijuana, especially in our neighborhoods that are currently being gentrified. And we find a strange thing happening. When this whole thing started with this marijuana thing. The black community and this youth were going to jail and unparalleled numbers for joint.'",
        "'speaker_7': '4000 years. And now that this legal. Folks who didn't pay the price through their life are now benefiting from the suffering of others who are still locked up in jail for the same thing that's legal now. Now during the time of slavery when it was abolished, you had to let everybody out of jail who had slave offenses'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And yet, to this day, we have people languishing in the prison system still under this stuff. It's now legal. Now. And our neighborhood unemployment rate among you doing this whole period of time was 65%. And this was a means and ways for them to survive and take care of things they needed to take in order to live'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And so, yes, there were some things that, you know, wasn't necessarily kosher, but it left them with the opportunity to actually practice what this country preaches. And that's creative capitalism. So we handled things on the down low and we did after hours.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, you'll do what you do. And then we got to after hours, we do what we do. But then we were persecuted for that. And now you have a monopoly sitting down in this mess of folks who didn't pay the price but benefited from the blood and imprisonment of other folks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's not fair. That's not fair. That's like you're coming back and say, we're going to do slavery all over again and take the country back to when it was great. So we need to do something about this whole thing with this marijuana thing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Stop forgetting the things that matter, especially when people are languishing in prison systems now for this mess and then free them from the past so they can get on with their day today and give them hope. That did not forgotten.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I implore the folks who are now currently managing and benefiting from the marijuana expansion and zoning changes and whatnot to begin to lobby. For a just resolution to this stuff, man. Because what is being sold? It's our culture.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's our culture. That's our way of life. We've made it available for everybody else to enjoy that too, at our expense. So there's a resentment behind this whole marijuana thing, this languishing and bubbling beneath the surface in the black community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And even though it's being gentrified, there's enough still there that matters. And so there's no excuses for this through as we continue doing this stuff. And I know the zoning change in the proper way. You would place to be looking at all of this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But now we have the possibility of putting this in subcommittee meeting to look at this thing, this whole marijuana thing, and see if we can make it something that's working properly and justice is being served. Yeah. Well, my man 41 say, that was pretty good.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'It's just a technical one, looking at the list of the rhinos that were notified. I noticed that the cross-community coalition, which represents the Swansea, a neighborhood, was not included, is a reason that they were left off the notification list.'",

And when we pulled them for this particular site, I don't think that one came up.'",

And I first want to start by just thanking Councilman Cashman and Councilwoman Ortega with helping me with this ordinance who was there. We worked on this for over a year, looking at all the issues with the construction prices and talking to the many participants in the process'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And and I especially want to thank everyone who brought this initial issue to our attention and and the organizations Helga, Gertrude, Joslyn Robinson and MAXINE Prior, all representing majority and MAXINE with Artie's formal process. So thank you for your support, especially with Frank.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank Diane Durfee, who's really the city attorney, sister city attorney who helped us guide us through this process and the many city departments that we talked to and and the, you know, city auditor, mayor, staff and so everyone so really appreciate all their their participation and support through this process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The best this is a best practices bill about the subcontractor. And it all goes back to the 2014 revised ordinance on the minority women in Small Business Enterprise Construction Contracting Ordinance. This ordinance addressed the many years of discrimination for the minority small businesses in construction and really provides the the growth and assistance to the growth and development'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for these organizations, allows the participation in city contracts and certifies their participation as individual companies, and also sets a percentage of goal a goal percentage of city construction contract value. So and most importantly establishes the division of small business opportunity here is to assist, help train and and participate with the the maybe with business small business looking'",
        "'speaker_8': 'at their payment practices and monitoring their activities. So a great ordinance, no great framework for development. And so we were proud to use that as the basis for our amendment. The how this all began is began again about a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we again heard testimony from many subcontractors about issues with problems of payment of payment irregularities. We heard issues about change orders that weren't properly paid or lumped together in a percentage of payment made, as well as there is work done on proposals that really wasn't compensated, especially when a contract was awarded.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So and a lot of discussion too about the lack of support of dispo in the education and training. So we heard a lot of issues that we wanted to address in addressing in this ordinance. And the thing that disturbed us the most is the real difficulty that all the minority subcontractors of small business had about coming forward'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and talking to us and and being able to publicly testify. They were really scared to do that. They were felt threatened. And because of this issue and they met with us individually, but because of their lack of willingness to be candid publicly, we put a retaliation, a part of this ordinance, which we'll talk about in a minute'",
        "'speaker_8': '. We interviewed all the subcontractors and the mayor, and we'd also interviewed subcontractors to get to validate their issues and concerns over. This is made up of five major portions as a billing and payment tracking process. And I'm going to go through each one of these.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have an early completed work routine, a retainer payment program, the linkage of letters of intent and construction utilization, the retaliation issue that I spoke of and the evaluation of the Division of Small Business Opportunity. The first one is the billing and payment tracking process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This came to our attention because the data on all of the billing requests and payments really wasn't transparent to to the city officials. Our city payment people were doing a good job. But what was done outside of the payment system of the city could not be seen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so it sort of promoted bad behavior on a few small contractors with these subcontractors. So we really developed this payment, a tracking system. We model it after our system is gone and have the I'll go over the list of information in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But almost 70 to 80% of the information we're talking about is already being collected by the Division of Small Business Opportunity and put it in their system. So we feel good that it's not going to cause a great deal of work on data collection.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our city attorney is counseling us all the time to stay separate away from the management of the construction projects. So this is strictly a process between this the minority subcontractors and small business and dispo. It's all about compliance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not about the management of a construction projects. So the contractors will not. We need to be involved and we'll be tracking it separately for billing system. This list I just showed you of the items we'll be collecting, just wanted to put in red those items that are presently being collected already.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just to give you an idea that we're not going to be collecting a lot of new information, but we what we what we want to do is try to automate it with the BTG system, compliance system. And we want to have a lot of discussion about how to make sure this is easy and is efficient for all'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of the minority subcontractors and for dispo and and promote that support and assistance to them. I included a clear copy of the this is the RTD form that they use. They developed this about seven or eight years ago, had the same problems with payment irregularities, with subcontractors by contractors and and by making this information transparent, it corrected'",
        "'speaker_8': 'those problems. It is really clear that this system worked very well, and we think that it will be working very well for us. Just to show emphasize again, the separate of the way we're handling this is strictly by compliance with the subcontractor submitting reports and information to dispo in a communication process versus the billing process where they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'submit billing requests. To the contractors, totally separate processes and maintain it that way. That's the tracking system. The second issue is the early completed work or changed payments. We had some concerns about this from subcontractors who were doing work early in a construction projects early the first month, and then all of a sudden the retainers, which is'",
        "'speaker_8': '5% of the billing request, is withheld by the city to the end of the project is being withheld like, you know, 24 to 48 months to the end of the construction project, even though their work was completed in the first month of the project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what we're asking to do is allow the sort of the adopt the state policy on that and allow at the request of this contractor, if he suggests to the city is the work was done, fine allowed. That subcontractor has completed his work to be reimbursed for his work change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The next letters of intent and construction utilization. There's a part of the 2014 ordinance that talks about when the project's specific proposals are accepted by the city, letters of intent by the contractor or to the subcontractors are submitted, telling the city who is going to be performing the work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Also, as part of the ordinance, five days after construction begins, the contractor is to submit a report to to the way to division small business opportunity, confirming who's doing which subcontractors are doing the work. And so both those reports are just need to be matched up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you don't if they do not match for some reason, then dispo would be responsible for asking the questions. Why not? Retaliation. I don't need to describe this any further with it was the talk, the subcontractors talk to us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it was just very disheartening that that they were so scared to be able to talk directly in public. So I thought this provision of our ordinance will help them. If there's any kind of retaliation issue that is reported, it will be followed up on for correction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the last is the most important is the evaluation of the Division of Small Business Opportunity, where we have good people in our Dispo office, they want to do a good job. And we've had some staffing issues. And and is this is going to give us an opportunity to really improve the department and improve the process and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'improve the support to the to the subcontractors and make sure that they're that our efforts to for them to grow and develop are really enhanced. So I've listed several things of assistance and education and training and following up, especially following up on any kind of irregularity as they find out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are the five parts of the ordinance, but there are three other areas. I just want to mention that we're going to be tracking and it's the next slide and these are this all relate to existing policy procedures.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All about that payment for approved completed work ordinances says we do pay for that and we'll be tracking that and that'll be part of our tracking system. The timing for a completed work, our property system that the city construction folks have is works very well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so we're going to again be part of our tracking system and the end of project routine is payment. That's been an issue of making sure that the subcontractors are paid promptly for retainers at the end of a project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The present policy is that when 95% of the construction project is complete, then the amount of retainers that's over in excess of two times the uncompleted work is can be released to the subcontractors. So as an example, if there's $500,000 in retained retainers, there's $200,000 in uncompleted work to be finished, then two times that before 100,000.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you can release $100,000. The difference between the 500,000 and the 400,000 this day, that process have been working well. We just need to monitor it to make sure it happens in a timely manner. In the last year, we want to focus on three really critical items.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, this is all about the 2014 ordinance. This is all about the growth and development and eliminating discrimination and and helping our small business and minority firms prosper. That 2014 ordinance was well crafted, well written, and it's an excellent document.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And all we're doing is adding just a few little implementation tools to to make sure that the intent of that audience is carried out. It's all about the small business and the minority firms. It's not about the management of a construction project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Data, data, data. We hear that so much. And this is critical that our process that we're going to be tracking all elements of the payment request and processing of payment. So to make sure that we see all activities within that process and be able to ask any questions if we find irregularities and all the data in the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'world can't help you if you don't have a department is following up actively. And we're we're looking forward to this division of small business opportunity. Having the staffing, the resources to support our small businesses and minority firms, help them grow and develop and help them educate and be trained.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and we really think that through the tracking system and the data that we're going to have and the the efforts of our division of small business, we're going to make a real difference. And it's going to help our small businesses grow and develop like we want.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's not our fault. Mr. Chairman. Mr. President, so thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Nu will now hear from the public. We have a one hour courtesy public hearing, but we have actually eight speakers signed up. Madam Secretary added one more. And so we will be moving on and I'm going to call the first five speakers to come up just to save a little time to that front row'",
        "'speaker_2': 'here. So, Helga Gruner, you will be first and Bennett, Jocelyn Robinson, MAXINE Prior and Keller Hays. Come on up and we'll get Ms.. Helga up first.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. I'm Helga Grunwald. I'm the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Newly retired.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Executive director of Hispanic Contractors of Colorado, where I was for 17 years. So I wanted to say that I've been involved with the Mwb ordinance since then. Mayor Hickenlooper launched the first committee in 2004, and when that first ordinance was was launched in 2007, we were very, very hopeful about all of the growth and progress we'd see'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with the small contracting community. And it didn't happen. What's happened over those years is that DSB has gotten buried further and further within the bowels of the city. It used to be the Mayor's Office of Contract Compliance. Another thing that's never happened is the education portion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's astounding to me that you hand someone a certification and you give them absolutely no training on key tools like LCP, Tracker B, two G, now tech store. These small businesses need to know how to use the tools to get themselves paid.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Another big problem has been as council and you mentioned, that there just isn't the staff to do the certification and training and monitoring that's required for all of the work that's coming up in the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You're going to need these contractors. And another part of the program that's never really been implemented is your SB defined selection pool that was created to build capacity. The city was going to put projects into that pool that only small businesses could bid on, and it has almost not happened.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've seen very little of it. You also have an SB pool, emerging small business pool, and we've seen almost no work put into that. And yet the ordinance recommendation said create these programs, SBA, CSP, where the small contractor can work directly with the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And in that way you will grow these businesses. And so I would encourage the city to look at that also. And finally, I'd like to say, with all the construction you have coming up in the city, you are going to need every single contractor that you can find.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And not only will workforce be a problem, but finding contractors to do the work will become an equally big problem. And you're competing with a lot of other agencies that have a lot of work, and I think you need to put yourself in the best position.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Grant. All right, Ms.. And Bennett.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I've been and I'm in councilman news territory. I'm a citizen of the city county of Denver. I'd like to thank the council members for their collaboration over the last 14 months and also your assistance in the validation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of my.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Observations and experiences during the period of 2014 to 2000, 15, 16, 2016. And also your due diligence. I mean, I've met with all of you. We've gone over this, and I think it's fairly apparent what's happening. But I, I firmly believe this implemented properly, Denver can be a model in Denver has been a model for a lot'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of things. And I think Denver can be it's a perfect model. We have the workforce. We have the development. I mean, it's waiting to happen. I would like to personally thank Councilman, new Councilwoman Ortega and Councilman Cashman for their 14 months for meetings and working with me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unfortunately, over the 14 months, there has been some collateral damage in the construction industry as a result of my coming forward. And I'm I'm very sorry about that. And I'm hoping in the future, as you put together your programs, this can be corrected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As an entrepreneur of small business, both in mechanical contracting and I.T. and by the way, I had 100 people in lower downtown when the viaduct was still there. So I've been there, and I understand the benefit that I had was for years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was many years at Big for accounting firms. These small business do not have that benefit. And I noticed that there's training here. And there's training here. And there's training here. If. We could combine all the training and also do a questionnaire.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are we training what they want to be trained on? I think we're missing it. And the mentor program is not happening. They're not being mentored. Mentored means you get out of your chair, you go to the job site that they're working on and you find out what their problems are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's true. Mentoring, and that's not happening. Two. And I think some of this is already happening. So I might be repeating. But the office maybe we the office has got to be a director position within the top organization of the mayor's office.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Period. It needs to be reported frequently to the city council and to the auditor. The data you develop on the B to G software must be which will not take three months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Meaning take a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Minute.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Your data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your money, your time, your time.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Much. No problem. Thank you. Thanks for your work on this. Okay. Miss Jocelyn Robinson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'She could have had another minute of my time. I am the facilitator for the Black Construction Group and we are out there to support and provide resources for small businesses. I also have been a of I'm a former employee of Dispo, so I know the difficulties that they are facing right now with the staff shortages and the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'work just continuing to increase. The only thing I would like to say, I do absolutely agree with Helga and and but I want to stress the importance of not adding more work to a department that is already struggling with the workload.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So making sure that we have a BTG system and it's not a manual system is going to be essential. And making sure that we provide the kinds of resources and educational opportunities for our small businesses to build capacity is absolutely important.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Can you tell us my first time? MAXINE Prior Chapter President four Come to Colorado. I must say, I'm very pleased that Councilman New and Councilman Cushman and Councilwoman Debbie Ortega have taken this on. This is a very critical time in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've got some explosive growth taking place and building our foundation and our infrastructure. From a complaints and monitoring standpoint is incredibly important. Similar to Helga, I also serve on the CII Committee Construction Empowerment Initiatives Subcommittee, in particular for the Disparity Study Slash Ordinance Review.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're going through line by line to see how we can help make an improvement and add to it. Actually, we started about the same time and were made aware earlier this year of the councilman's efforts. So we're very pleased to be able to take part in this historic activity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm very optimistic about the increased compliance and monitoring aspect of what this is going to bring. The orientation training for the subs. I am a stickler for training. I believe in setting expectations upfront and making sure that you have an education.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have the tools. You're aware of what your rights and responsibilities are so that further down the line and into the projects, there's no question. And we can have an intelligent discussion as to how to move forward. Capacity building and supportive services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those things are also key. And I think, again, this ordinance is going to help launch us in that direction to make sure that that's going to take place. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Ms.. Pryor. Keller Hayes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Keller Hayes. I work with the U.S. Department of Transportation and their Small Business Transportation Resource Center. And I really want to thank the entire council for discussing this tonight and looking at this. I have worked with the our clients.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have 560 clients. I've also worked with the Utah Department of Transportation, the North Dakota Department of Transportation. I've also worked with the Utah Transit Authority and with the both airports in Salt Lake City and here. And I also worked on the Minority Women Chambers Coalition, which had 3000 people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the reason I tell you all of that is because I know that there aren't contractors here. We have heard so many of them, and I understand why they're not here. We counsel people on business, and quite frankly, it's not a great thing for you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be here with your business, with who you want to do business with. So what has been talked about this entire year is so true. Subcontractors are out there struggling. They're struggling with some of the things that you just want to go well, in common sense, we wouldn't do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So having retained each go for two years, I mean, who here could wait for their paycheck for two years? Not me. And that's what we're asking the subs to do. So this ordinance is actually going to make a difference on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also talk to people that their bond has been required to go for three years while your bond determines how much work you can do. So if it's being held for three years, one of the things that Councilwoman Black mentioned was change orders.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your change orders, if you don't have those documented correctly, you can kiss that money goodbye. So there's a lot of things that this ordinance can really impact. The other thing that's important is the implementation of it. And once you have the implementation, that training, that education and really understanding how to work, the things like transfer, like change'",
        "'speaker_1': 'orders, retain age payment, that's so important. And I know that this council, one of your goals is to really help with this ordinance to grow minority women, small businesses. And this ordinance can help you to do that. And I really appreciate you taking our community that seriously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much. And I really hope you pass this ordinance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Miss Hayes. All right. I'll call you. Five can go back to your seats and I'll call the next three of the final three. Joseph Serna, Chairman Sekou and Barbara Myrick. Mr. Cernan, you were first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Joseph Stern. I'm with you as Dottie West, southwest region, west central region. I'm the program director and I work with Keller Hayes. And the what we do is work with small businesses in our region, construction infrastructure, really, to help them better prepare so they can do the kinds of works that Denver is doing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was at an event last week where Mayor Hancock got an award from the other mayors. I guess that partners for all the work that he's done and a champion he's been for small business and it's small business a term that we throw around pretty, pretty easily construction and we build.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Ebbs and Bibi's and the DBS, all of that gets thrown around pretty easy. And it's hard to keep track of all of that. But at the end of the day, Denver has an opportunity here with everything going on, looking at the goals and the prime contractors that are telling you your goals are set to high, you're set'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to steep. We don't have capacity. We can't do what you're asking us to do too much. I think you're being fed a line. There's plenty of small businesses. There's a lot of them out here. But what we don't need to do is we don't need to take these small businesses all the way down to the ten yard'",
        "'speaker_7': 'line and then blindfold them and then take their blockers away and then take their support away and then say, oh, well, we couldn't hit our goals. Let's not do that. This ordinance, along with the people that have supported it and are standing behind it, have done all of the hard work behind it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Small businesses. None of them. None of them are asking for a handout. None of them are asking you to give it to them. All they're asking is just don't take it away from me. I work behind and off for you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I did my best for you. I hired the people that I know could do it. You got a quality job. Please stand behind me when it comes time for me to get paid. So the next project. We can do it again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we can be that model. Denver has the opportunity to do it. There is no other city in the Rocky Mountain region. You got to go 400 miles in any direction to find any other city with capacity like this and with all the work that's going on here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a magnet to everybody else is trying to come here and do work. Let's make sure that the home team here can do some work. Just make sure that they get paid and let's not leave them out there and you have an opportunity to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we can't put this together and not put training there. You've got to have training. We've got to have capacity at the top so that people can take care of it. And so the small businesses are left again short.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Mr. Sana, chairman of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Chairman Sekou Blackstar is a movement representing poor, working, poor homeless people, senior citizens. Okay. Pray for me on this one, Stacey. This one might get me in trouble. I'm not going to do it. What we are faced with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's something my grandfather told me when I told him that I wanted to be. A lawyer asked me, What do you want to do when you grow up? And I want to be a lawyer like Perry Mason. You know, because we grew up in that generation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And he said, well, let me tell you something about lawyers. The law. Is not worth and this is, quote, the law is not worth a bucket of spit if it's not enforced. When we look at this whole process and everything everybody said is true.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And as a former executive director for the Baby Highest Point Community Development Corporation, I had the opportunity to rehab in the Navy shipyards in Hunters Point back in the seventies. And what I discovered was that there was a cultural process, a way people did, things that was ingrained over years and years, years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in the process of doing this project. I couldn't change that overnight. Folks were stubborn. I mean, they were stuck on stupid Jack. Even the law said it didn't matter because it was corrupted. I'm talking about for real.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And when you look at this process, we've had laws on top of laws. On top of laws. We didn't created DSB oaths and all of that. And yet they still don't do the work. Because it's corrupted at the top in the mayor's office, where you choose to look the other way because you have other things happening that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'influence your decision. Call em all in e. Y. And we're all stuck with that. Because that's the nature of the society that we live in is about the money and we have big projects coming on with a corrupted entity already in existence that hasn't done this job ever.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so as we was going through the subcommittee, I mean, I remember one of the guys who came in was a contractor that had the courage to stand up with it. He said the key to this whole process of minority business people, small business, is how do we grow them out of being small businesses and compete on'",
        "'speaker_7': 'equal level with the rest of the industry. And he said that's the issue. Where are the graduates of the program who are now out there competing? Well, there ain't gonna be none if you got what you going on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what we need in this process is an independent monitor that can monitor this project with the current.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cycle.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To this cycle. Mayor accountable for this cycle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Barbara Myrick. You are last.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, good evening. Excuse my voice. My name is Barbara Mark. I am the president of being M Construction. And so we perform electrical interior, build out space planning and design. And we've been a mwb since 2011. Two years ago, I encountered said, it's time for us to move on our strategic plan and city and county of Denver'",
        "'speaker_10': 'was part of it. So I must thank the city and county of Denver first for having a minority woman business enterprise certification. I come from Colorado Springs and so we're so far behind. So I applaud you for being ahead and entertaining small businesses and trying to help small businesses grow.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But with that, we've had some challenges here. We grew up in the federal arena, so I think we do business very well. When I started with Denver, my bonding capacity was single ten and my aggregate was 20. But because of some of the complications of the policies and people, different agencies and how they do things as cause'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the hurdle for us where we now have 50,000,005 million single and 15 million aggregate. My, my, my concern is the change orders in the real world, work stops. You don't move forward. Well, here, work continues. And they want negotiated end.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And right now I have a claim in with the city and county of Denver, and I probably will be going to litigations with the city and county of Denver. I think some people do the processes correctly. I think if they everyone uses text, Terra is very transparent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But when you have one agency that you know, one does it and the other one doesn't, that creates problems. And so right now, we have a job with the public works. Some things were in text era, but one contract isn't.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so for us to be taking is December. Now going into January and we haven't been paid from August. I think there are some issues there. I think people change the processes. I think there's this is a process issue with me, with the city and county of Denver and the people on the other side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're talking about the subcontractors and the contractors being trained, but the people within the city that are handling these procurements need to be trained. My my daughter used to work for the city and county of Denver. Now she works for me because I'm transitioning out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And one thing she said to me that I want to share, she said, public servants, when you become when you work for the public, you become a public servant. And that is to help everyone within the community. Which means if we're going to if you're going to impose these here ordinances, then everyone needs to comply.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The people that work for the city and county of Denver, also the subcontractors. That's all I have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It's my right on time. Okay. This concludes our speakers questions for members of council. See. That's when it's another. Just a quick question for you, Barbara. And forgive me. I just don't know. I never worked for the city, but only indirectly on contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we. Do we allow provision or have any provisions when we do projects where there is a sort of fallback that you would be covered for time and materials? You know, if and when you performed work at that, you were directed and otherwise, you know, shouldn't because it's a change order situation and you need approval and whatnot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that there's sort of this tacit approval that you would actually be allowed to sort of proceed with the time and materials sort of basis. Do we have any sort of thing like that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't believe so. So funny you would ask that because our change request was for delay and the city caused the delay. But now the city says our documentation was correct, but they're not going to pay the change order.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I put in a claim the other day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You were smart to do that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm I'm one of those. I'm not a rebel, but I will stand up. And if I'm the lonely wolf. In the wilderness by myself doing it to make sure that is aware is brought to the attention of others.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I will be the lonely wolf in the wilderness. And so I just like I said, I just think the process is. Everyone in the city and county of Denver does not comply with your ordinances. They make the contractors and they make the subcontractors.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I don't think the project managers comply with the city ordinances. That's my concern.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any suggestion to us? So one of my concerns about the way we conduct business these days is we do we do a lot of task order contracts with different with the agencies which give them a little latitude. And so they'll go in, find out, you know, find a half dozen, five, three, two, 5 to 6 people that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'work in a certain in certain form or provide a certain discipline. And they'll give them essentially all the same task order contract. And then, of course, then they have their mini bid process and to let out contracts based on the task force.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we never really see who they're contracting with to what level sort of until all the accounting is done. Is there any concern that our process of sort of deferring all those decisions strictly to the agencies that they're they're they're they're not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, is there any concern about transparency or how they're letting those contracts out?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I understand they're I understand why they do it is shortens the playing field. The RFP doesn't have to go out. The federal government, they don't they do it all the time. They have their May talks, their sabers, their I.D. cues and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So to to have a task order driven contract, I, I think it's good because it does shorten the playing field. But what it doesn't do is you can have three contractors and they might only go to one. So they might have rules in place if you don't respond.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Like we I have a on call with the city and county of Denver electrical. I have SB on call with Denver Airport and we just want to be DPS. But if you don't respond then eventually they won't invite you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I do understand the process. My my concern is the transparency of it. If, if you don't know what your bid is, so they don't share that information. If you want to know Where did I fall in the process?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They really don't have to share that. The city and county of Denver do debriefs. I have an experienced debrief so I can know how do I bid next time? What did I file fail on? Where was my number at?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Was it too high here? Not without giving out the information, but sharing something so that small businesses can be more prepared to bid your work and to understand your processes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Last question is Oh, here we go. Commentary is to me, yes, there's always a danger that an industry or particular industry or a group of players sort of have a corner on a market, could collude and raise prices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But to me, if the city were to actually have a, you know, clay, you know, make it very clear that their bids are open and will be shared upon request. Don't you think that actually would net benefit the city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because then you guys would sort of know what everyone's competing with and what money, what dollars they're asking for, for for a particular work or not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So when. We, we, we, we've experienced some of the open bids and some people lowball to get a job and then they're change orders. I'm not a change to company when when we submit numbers, just a true number.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's what we think is going to cost. But if someone comes in lower than that, you go, Oh, that I really missed something or did a little bit. And now they're going to have a bunch of change orders.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So then you question that as well. Sometimes low bid is not the best bid is what's the best value. You know, when you incorporate grain, when you incorporate let's do some value engineering on electrical when you look at those things.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's where the true dollars are, is not in the low bid in change orders. It really isn't because if they don't get it upfront, they're going to come and get you in the back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. And I think that's where some of this monitoring can can benefit is that we can actually, you know, we should be able to sort of discern where is it that our scope was deficient? Where or is it that the the bid I mean, the the change order process was essentially being taken advantage of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman, you want to say those for your comments? That's true. But thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. All right. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for what is this now? 1324 is not close. We have comments by members of council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll start with councilman new being his bill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. president. Really proud of what the work we did this this year to develop this ordinance. It's just payment is so critical to the small businesses is just for their growth and development. We've got to make sure we have efficient, timely and accurate payment processes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the enforcement issue is very important. We've got to make sure that dispose followed up helping train and develop. We've got to make sure that our payment practices are accurate and do whatever we can to assist the growth and development of the minorities in small firms.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that independent spirit of this bill is critical. We've got to be able to be able to represent their constituents, which are these minority firms and small businesses without any outside influence and pressure. So I'm really proud that we worked on this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we're going to really make a difference with this bill. And and I'm also proud that the mayor is supporting our ordinance if it if we're fortunate enough to pass it tonight. So I just encourage my colleagues to support this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman, and thank you for your leadership. Next up, co-sponsor Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I last year, last I guess it was earlier this year, had the honor of participating in the council team and in the marathon. And I had the shortest leg and I was the slowest on the team.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I did what I could. And I kind of feel like that was my participation in this event. Hopefully I learned something along the way, but I also wanted to take my hat off to the four brilliant women who were with this process pretty much from the beginning, and Bennet, Helga Grunwald, Joslin Robinson and MAXINE Prior.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These people understand this topic inside and out and were absolutely essential. And I want to thank Councilwoman Ortega has been involved in this for years and has been a champion for the small business and maybe we be community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But for me, you know, we we talk a lot on the dais and when someone is a point person for a topic about leadership and in my time on council, I have never seen more direct and persistent leadership on a topic than a councilman new put forth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In this case, I'm just relentless on so sure of the importance of what we were doing. He met with everybody. I mean, I know Councilman Ortega and I were in a bunch of meetings. Councilman knew was in a way more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was not a stone left unturned. And it's such an important topic. I mean, it's a shame that we didn't have more of the subs here today, but we heard from sub after sub about losing hundreds of thousands of dollars, getting negotiated out a big dollars at the end of a long job as has been shared, large'",
        "'speaker_4': 'dollars retained for months, if not years. And it just became. Clear to me early on how important this is. So obviously, I would urge my colleagues to support this. And again, thank Councilman Nu for his clear leadership on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Next co-sponsor. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks, Mr. President. So I first want to thank all of the folks from the contracting community that really took the time to sit down and meet with us and help us understand the breadth and the depth of the issues that they were dealing with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because had it not been for that, we wouldn't have really been able to get to the heart of some of the details. And obviously, Helga and Anne and Jocelyn and MAXINE were were critical in bringing a lot of those people to the table to talk with us and share their stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, I mean, some of these stories are just break your heart. And when we have an ordinance that's supposed to be growing companies, but yet we're putting companies out of business that were going in the wrong direction. So, Councilman, New, you have been such a an incredible leader in this process to just move this along.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as Councilman Cashman said, there was no stone left unturned. Everybody that needed to be engaged was involved in this process and had input from, you know, the city attorney's office, public works, you name it. Every city agency that touches this was involved in one way or the other, including a number of folks from the DSB office'",
        "'speaker_6': 'who were very helpful and giving good input and assisting us in in shaping this, including the auditor's office. So, you know, for for everybody that's been involved, it's been a long haul. I want to thank my colleagues who have taken the time to sit down with with folks from the community and with those of us who met'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with you to to hear what these issues were all about and the importance of making these changes to this ordinance now and not waiting for the current disparity study to be completed and a new ordinance to be written.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But to deal with this now, when we have all of the construction projects that are going to be moving forward as early as next year, that will ensure that women and minority businesses who do work on these projects are getting paid for the work they do that's been approved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if we do that, then we're doing our job in growing these businesses and making sure that the the the outreach that needs to be happening from the SBA to recruit businesses to do the certifications for those new businesses, that education and training is vital to their success and survival.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The compliance and the enforcement that that agency is all about per the ordinance. We need to do more ensuring that up in this ordinance will help in a significant way. And I know that the SBA added people to their staff, but in the 2018 budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm not convinced that's going to be enough. I think with the volume of work that we have, they need to be. And, you know, to their credit, they engaged a consultant to help them look at the agency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think they may find that they need to add more people to handle the volume of work that we're going to be dealing with over the next, you know, 5 to 7 years in this city. So I am a staunch supporter and just want to thank also my colleague, Councilman Cashman, who was a big part of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this process as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Lupe Espinosa is up first. Thank you, Mr. President. Or. I just want to say when I first came, called me in to sort of introduce what he was what they were tackling. You know, it was clear that there was a need here that needed to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. But. You know, where where it was at and the sort of the size of the lift and the approach was was. I just didn't see how how you could possibly get to this point. And, you know, one thing I didn't do was doubt Wayne's resolve at that point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was it was self-evident. And somehow 14 months with now, I can see every every face that was involved in getting this. But I just I don't know how to say it enough, but every time I was presented with with updates on it, I was always amazed and impressed by how well considered and the resolution of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of open items was was addressed. And so to to to you, councilman, new for for leading it, you've given a lot of credit to others. So to all the people that he's given credit, including my colleagues, Ortega and Cashman, thank you for getting, Wayne, the support that he needed and the clarity that he needed and the people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the room that he needed to get to this final bit of legislation, because it does so much of the things that that were trying to be addressed early, early on. And it does so in a way that to me can be readily captured and done and performed and get the outcomes that that were strived for from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the get go. And so I just really wanted to give you kudos to you and your team for taking on this very important piece of legislation and making it happen. So thank you. All right. Jennifer Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to extend my thanks to Councilman Cashman, Ortega and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Newman, especially to the group that was so persistent. I remember sitting in the in the first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Meeting and scratching my head and how do we fix that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I sat in this meeting with Councilman New, it perplexed me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because I knew.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was happening. I saw it happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It wasn't the first time I heard it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And really didn't have a solution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's hard. It's it's a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Really tough environment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because if you say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Something, you're blacklisted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. They they you know, the squeaky wheel gets replaced.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's that's kind of. The dog.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Eat dog.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'World in the industry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's how that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I understood it and that's how I got the perception I had from folks. And I saw it. It was real. And these issues are real.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That meeting was important for me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But more more importantly, and not surprisingly, it never ceases to surprise him. But this this is really not surprising, knowing that we knew. Had a solution. And we knew the council member from Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was going to address.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Once and for all this issue that our mwb is have been facing for a long time. And I thought, man, what a. What a great opportunity. If we can get this moving forward and to see.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It become ordinance. And so, you know, I definitely think this is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A step in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of other things that we need to address in this industry. There's a lot of other disparities, a lot of other disadvantages that we have, so to speak. You know, as a as a minority community, woman community, I really want to see a minority of more people of color who are in business, women who are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in business.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I'm just internally grateful. I am eternally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Grateful. I'm sorry, Councilman, for your work, your expertize that you lent. And I've been long, long enough. And I've been on this council long enough that I'd be.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Your work on our behalf. All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. This concludes our comments by members of council.
