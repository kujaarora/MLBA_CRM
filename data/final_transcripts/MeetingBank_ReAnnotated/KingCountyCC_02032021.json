So we don't have an expenditure plan for 2022 and beyond that would be included in the implementation plan that would go to council next'",
        "'speaker_1': 'year, later this year. Okay. So my suggestion would be that we do the same thing as we do in others, that there be a minimum one so that every every one of them is the parties can do something and that we figure out what that force should be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember WG.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I've got two questions, but before I do, I just want to state a respectfully contrary view. The goal of this entire program is to house up to 1600 or so people. The number has grown because the projections have grown by purchasing or constructing single room occupancy type housing developments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's a certain number that you need in order to to house that many people. And that number is not 39. We're not going to build one or buy one in every single jurisdiction in King County. It's just it's not feasible or they're not necessarily available.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the idea of getting a benefit, the benefit is to get people out of homelessness and really make a dent in homelessness in King County. This is not a peanut butter program where each jurisdiction gets some amount of money to spend on whatever is local.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The cities are an opportunity and as you see, many of them took it to hold on to the sales tax adopted in their cities, and they're going to do what they do with that. But this is a regional program and I think it needs to remain that way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's part of the reason why I wasn't in favor of the idea of kind of consolidating more funding to hand over to other cities. Because the impact we can have here is a regional impact. And I think that we should stick with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But let me go to my my two questions. The first one is, we're still working on legislation that makes it clear that purchasing of properties is allowed with this funding. Is that correct? Yeah. So the state legislature is working on clarifying some of the language of that produced ambiguity, including around purchasing of hotels or other things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does the does the direction that this ordinance would provide to the executive to provide an implementation plan account for the fact that that's likely to be adopted after we vote? I say it's silent on it, so it doesn't it doesn't preclude the implementation plan, including hotels or other or other purchases, assuming the legislature does act.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it doesn't it does it requests specifically that the implementation plan include it, which is probably fine because we asked for a report to include certain things, doesn't mean they can't include lots of other things. Like we don't tell them, do not say anything else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so that was thing one. I just had a request from our constituent jurisdictions this morning about ongoing operations. So by its nature, these buildings will be made to be operated into the future. They'll need to be maintained.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There will need to be some ability for King County folks to have resources to interact with the host communities, if you will, and be able to, you know, maintain the relationships and respond to two issues as needed. Is the does the implementation plan, as requested, make sure that we're asking for information about maintenance and operation being adequately'",
        "'speaker_1': 'funded. I my, my, my fear is that you put all the focus or an undue focus on the capital.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Aspects of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Program and that we make sure that we're going to plan for the kind of operation and maintenance dollars that will be significant that will be needed on an ongoing basis. So the implementation plan or this ordinance does not specifically request that, but it is within the scope of of the state legislation to allow operations and maintenance of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those facilities. Well mentioned that the first goal of the required implementation plan is the creation and ongoing operation of the units of affordable housing, which really is the address on the call today. Why now? Okay. I'm just going to assume they heard what I asked and that that is something that I think is important and that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'don't have to really look at closely when we see the implementation plan rather than trying to amend this, which then sets off procedural loops. So thank you very much, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And welcome, colleagues. That's typical Lowe's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. For our staff or for cowriter Mark Goldberg who are on the line?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, how.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does the the current just care program fit into all of this? I mean, their goals seem to align at least somewhat here with what is contemplated. And would it make any sense for the implementation plan to, I think, consider proceeds to reduce the need of existing shelter facilities to vulnerable populations who are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Experiencing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Chronic homelessness and where there are some behavioral or other issues. It just seems like there's some overlap here, and I'd appreciate your letting me know more about that. I'm happy to kick it off and then hand it over to Mark and Kelly if they have additional comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So certainly certain components of just care would would could apply to these proceeds, including the operation of delivery or evaluation of mental and behavioral health programs and services and housing related services. I think some of those hotel purchasing questions also go to counseling about duties, question about about what the state legislature is possibly doing this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But certainly some components could apply. Thank you very much for. Is there anything else, anybody?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the only other thing that I would add, Councilmember, is that I think the population for just care and the population that we are looking at for the health or housing program are very similar, if not identical.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think there is a fair amount of overlap in that place. One of the pieces that we kind of the lines that we need to walk and be clear on here is the difference between the housing and the shelter way that we're kind of implementing these two programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And obviously just care moves folks into hotel type settings on a temporary basis. And I think we need to kind of tease out there there's how that kind of overlaps. So but I think from a population perspective, you're right on as far as identifying the commonality.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask one more question. Thank you. Whether it be makes sense or even be needed to have an amendment brought up that would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Include.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Specifically just pure or just pure life type of program to be included? Or would that already be covered in the language of the legislation? Councilmember This is Kelly, Writer for the record, Don, manager with Department of Community and Human Services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for the question. Obviously, DHS would defer to the Council on deciding what amendments you would like to add. We feel like there is sufficient flexibility in the ordinance as it stands to be able to continue our ongoing conversations with the Public Defenders Association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As Mark said, there's a lot of consistency and alignment with the population that PBA has been serving and the type of approach they've been taking. And I think the ordinance gives us the broad level direction of being able to think through in the permanent supportive housing framework, how we would continue to serve that population.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That's exactly what I was interested in, ma'am. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. On page 14, I think has some really good language that we're talking about, where the spending plan is in compliance with the ICW. That requires a minimum 60% of revenue to be used for constructing affordable housing, mental or behavioral health related facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that's right, right up there. And so what I'd like to add to that is that as one of the other covers has said, that it'd be ongoing, that there be like a navigator, so that as issues come up in the long term, that there's a place for people to call and make sure that everything's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'okay. And then I do agree that we're trying to get this done regionally and trying to make sure that we help people as quickly as possible to get into appropriate housing, not tent serve or other. That may not be as appropriate, but I do believe that we need to not leave the cities out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The cities are dealing with homeless people and just getting them to the right place will cost them money. So I think it's a combination of both. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Making sure that we have the ability to move people experiencing chronic homelessness throughout the region into housing summary in the region is imperative and I hope cities are permissive of opportunities to purchase facilities in successfully housed people as we have seen, for example, that had such great success in the Red Lion in Renton.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'DEMBOSKY Councilmember DEMBOSKY. Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is a return to Amendment Two, which I voted against at the RTC, although it carried otherwise, and it was described by staff here today as establishing a process to work with the city, which I think is good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But my concern, if there is a possibility, was that it ultimately would allow the city to veto our ability to appoint or property as a county government. And I want to understand that that is a fact, because because I think that goes a little too far.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think cities do have their tools in terms of zoning and fundraising. To be able to control our government's ability to acquire property is very unusual, if not unprecedented for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. But I think your, your summary is correct that the siting process would, would be directive where the cities could hypothetically say no to citing a facility in their jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that clarification. That seems contrary to even what Councilmember Lambert was just speaking to the the need to be able to have facilities to support this population across the county. Hello. Council members. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. As we all know, there are certain populations that are overrepresented in our homeless population. Black people and Native American people. And I know the tax has explicitly stated goal of reducing racial disproportionality. Can someone speak a little bit to whether part of that strategy of reducing and eliminating the racial disproportionality involves partnering with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'organizations that are led by those groups to provide housing and to address the other needs that are associated with homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is not explicitly required in the implementation plan ordinance in front of you today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And can someone from DC speak to why that is? I can thank you, Councilmember Dollar, and I realize I didn't introduce myself for the record. So Mark and I broke from the department community and Human Services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As far as the implementation plan, including or the proposed legislation discussing the implementation and implementation plan, including that language, I can't speak to whether it's inclusion or not, but what I can speak to is the department's commitment on this and how we expect to do this work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think you're Point Council member is exactly right. We have a lot of strong nonprofits in this community, in this region who are excellent at supportive housing. And we have a lot of nonprofits that have deep cultural roots or deep ethnic roots serving certain populations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what we really hope to do through this program is try to bring those together where we get both the expertize on the operations side and the expertize and the disproportionality and the cultural side together. And I would point to an example of where we've been successful in doing that is the project that we work with both'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Catholic Community Services and chiefs, Sierra Club in Seattle, where we actually had a program where we brought those two. We work together with those two agencies to work on a program that really targets American-Indian, Alaska Native Homelessness. And this is a project that's on Metro property on Sixth Avenue South and really have ended up in a place'",
        "'speaker_2': 'where Catholic Community Services has stepped out of the operation of that facility. Chief Sierra Club has really stepped in to meet that disproportionality need that we know is represented. And I think we are hoping to build on that model with the rest of health or housing as we kind of move that forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think we have that expectation, expectation and intend to build that into the development and implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now. Councilmember, let me first set aside, for lack of a better word, in number nine to be at the very end of the ordinance, does talk about 1% being used to support and build the capacity of meat based organizations to serve a demographically disproportionately represented populations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And our intent is certainly to use that funding to support buying for community of color led organizations in being able to engage in providing services and really need the work in these housing developments. So are there any organizations that you think we should be reaching out to and conversations that we would certainly love to add them to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our list?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Kelly and Mark. Concern that I'm hearing a lot of our intent is to and our plan is to, but it's not in the legislation. And so I would want to create an amendment for something along those lines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Chair, can you help me understand the procedure for doing that? Is it possible to bring in an amendment before for council, or does that have to be something that's done here today?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council members. Hello. Indeed, because this is a mandatory dual referral. We could adopt an amendment here or presumably at full council and it would be referred back to the Regional Policy Committee. And so. I guess I. I'm thinking as I'm speaking, which is maybe not brilliant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't matter where it would be done. An amendment today or an amendment in for council would be appropriate. We would then send the legislation to the Regional Policy Committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thanks a lot, Mr. Chair.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'A as a representative of waste management. Waste Management. And. William Louis. As a citizen representative. Application materials were sent out to council members prior to the meeting. Tara Rose from Council South will provide a brief staff report on the purpose and makeup of the committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then we'll hear from the potential nominees. Intern Tara Rose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. For the record, Tara Rose, Council staff, as the chair noted, agenda item seven through nine concern appointments to the King County Solid Waste Advisory Committee, or SWAC. And the materials for these items began on page 29 of your pocket.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll provide some very, very brief background on the committee and then turn it over to the council members. State law requires each county to establish an advisory committee to assist in the development of programs and policies concerning solid waste handling and disposal, and to review and comment upon.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Prior to adoption. King County, SWAC was established in the mid 1980s and per King County Code. The SWAC is composed of at least nine and not more than 20 members representing a balance of interests, including citizens, local elected officials, industry representatives, environmental representatives, among others.'",

Staff have not identified any issues with the proposed appointments and they appear to be consistent with the requirements of King County Code and state law. As the Chair noted, the appointees have been invited today and we also have Pat McLaughlin, Solid Waste Division Director, for questions, and that concludes my remarks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin. Any opening comments, introduction on your part? Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just to say that, as you know, the work ahead for solid waste regional system is significant and we're on an exciting path.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Qualified to lend experience and expertize that will really help inform and advise the Council, the executive and the division in important policy choices and important exploration of tools, techniques and partnerships. So I'm excited about the prospect of of these candidates.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let's start with Ms.. Record. Can you please introduce yourself, share a little bit about your background, your work in the field.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for your time. It's Wendy Weicker, not Welker. So Weicker, I like your chair. McDermott Thank you very much for remembering that. And to confirm, I work for a public service, not waste management.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I do represent industry and I think most of you are probably familiar with Republic as we serve 19 cities and King County from residential or commercial recycling and solid waste services. We're a national company. We're in 42 states with 36,000 employees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We operate trucks, transfer stations and landfills. We know this business inside and out. We've been doing it for over 30 years as Republic Services, but our big important work that we do is really locally and in our neighborhoods and in our communities.'",

Part of our core work is also responsibility around the environment and climate action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are committed to that work, as is the county. Our recycling facility center down on third and Lander has been handling recyclable materials for over 30 years. It's the largest murf west of the Mississippi. We are committed to recycling even though it's challenged with China sword.'",

And what I'm particularly proud of is Republic recently joined the Washington Employers for Equity Initiative at the Roundtable and Challenge Seattle put together in the last year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are proud partners in this. Racial justice and social justice work personally have been working with Pat and his team at the King County, SWAC and Municipal SWAC. For the 18 months I've been at Republic Services, I'm keenly aware of the work we have to do around zero waste and the rate restructuring to make sure that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that work is sustainable while we figure out how to do more reduce, reuse and recycle. I understand the county's work also through the sustainability goals and how that has to match with economic realities and the tolerance that our rate payers have in managing this work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so it's going to take a partnership to navigate through all the challenges that Pat alluded to you earlier and that maybe some of you who care about this climate action work and materials management that we do for this industry and this partnership.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And when I have called for the tape to reconcile, the two tapes don't exist. And now that we are able to to record things on Zoom, I think it would be a good thing for the new members to look into making sure that the meetings are recorded so that if the minutes have some issues that we can'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The. I'm glad to hear you're talking about re-use and recycling and abuse, which I think is a very exciting thing. I'm very pleased about the abuse commit plan where you go and you can have your things fixed and change them into all kinds of other kinds of useful things around your house.'",
