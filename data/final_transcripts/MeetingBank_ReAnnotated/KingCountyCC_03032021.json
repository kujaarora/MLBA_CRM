        "'speaker_0': 'Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Hartwell. Well, welcome. To the committee. The Hall. We want to thank you for your interest in serving in District Court and welcome you to our meeting this afternoon. This morning hasn't gone on that long yet, and I invite you to begin with opening remarks and ask you to limit them to 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you and good morning to the entire council. I really appreciate this opportunity to be here today to talk with you all. I am a community minded, hard worker and I just want to tell you briefly how I believe I became that way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I grew up on a farm in eastern Washington near Yakima in a small farming community. My grandparents were farmers. They had a sixth and eighth grade education. My parents were farmers, but they had the opportunity to go to college and they both became schoolteachers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So they farmed and they taught school. On the farm I grew up on, which I worked with my twin sister and my parents. I learned very quickly the value of hard work. If we wanted heat inside our home, we had to chop wood and bring it inside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we wanted food on the table. We had to turn the garden and turn the animals. That really stuck with me about how I grew.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Was the kind of community I grew up in, and that's the kind of community that took care of each other. Neighbors helped each other as the neighbors animals got out. You went out and you helped round them up no matter what time of night and no matter how cold it was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But then you also helped your neighbor mend fences so that it didn't happen again. And that's the kind of community I grew up I grew up in, which makes me community oriented. I left the farm at age 18 to play basketball at Yale on scholarship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you can imagine, I'm sure, that I was a fish out of water there having just left the farm. It took me a while to find my place there, and I eventually did learn to trust in my ability to learn almost anything.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But most importantly there I found my calling in public service and. I noticed, I began to notice and I began to really bother me. The wealth disparity I saw between my classmates and the many homeless people in New Haven.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then as I studied sociology and history and kind of became awake, I realized it was part of historical racial injustice. And I see that one time went really fast. So I'll skip to the conclusion. You know, I love the district court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've had many experiences that were positive as a pro tem, as a lawyer. My wife and I chose to be married there, and I've had many excellent teachers there in terms of the judges and the court staff. And I would be honored to serve on the incoming district court.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Colleagues to someone want to step up and ask the first question. Council Member Col Wells. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greetings to you again. Thank you. What do you see is the most critical issue the court is facing and what you believe the role of the district court judge would be in addressing this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you know, we talked about that in the subcommittee. I have thought about it and I thought about it some more, actually, since the last time we talked. You know, one of the critical issues in our society has always been the role of inherent and structural racism in our institutions and in our society and in our courts'",
        "'speaker_1': '. The role of the court is is critical in that we have a moment now, I think, where we are all as a society, re-imagining how we want to be and what the court's role is going to be in that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Some really important things are happening now. For example, Court Rule 3.4 has been changed, which really eases the burden of defendants charged with crimes from having to come to court. Every month we'll see childcare and missed work and roundup transportation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the court should embrace those changes that move toward equity. The court needs to study its own practices and policies, and before any policy or procedure is adopted, the court needs to ask, you know, is it just is it fair, is it equitable?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does it promote equity? Of course it has to be lawful, but that goes without saying. And then, you know, always there's the budget impact, of course. But we can't we have to start asking our questions, asking ourselves on every policy, every decision, does this promote equity?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's the role of the court. I can address the role of the judge or or what I personally have done later, if that's a question. But I'll leave it at that right now. But certainly self-examination for the organization as a whole is really important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Belushi and myself a moment. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and welcome. It's very nice to meet you and to hear from you. I want to say I was very taken by one of the anecdotes in your reference letters that concluded with Kristen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Shotwell knows it all by virtue of knowing the price of tomatoes. I thought that was said a lot in a in a very and very pithy way. This question is, please describe how you have incorporated equity and social justice principles into your work in the justice system and how that work would be furthered if you are appointed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to this position. Thank you. So really important question. And I asked myself that for 25 years as a practitioner, I have stood as a social worker and a lawyer side by side clients for 25 years, nearly who face everyday the impacts of structural racism, blatant racism, implicit bias.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so aside from examining that, in every case, as a practitioner filing appropriate motions, asking what you're doing on implicit bias, asking for instructions, you know, the District Court and Superior Court judges made a wonderful video for jurors on implicit bias.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of course we ask that to be we played in an every jury trial the the. And so as a practitioner I've made all of those appropriate motions and talked about that in every case. But this is not as I said it, this is not academic for me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is really important because it affects my clients and my work. And so I have when DPD formed its Equity Society and Justice Committee, I signed up right away, particularly the community outreach part, because that's something I really enjoy and working on that body.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I worked with a group of wonderful people and and kids who've been involved with law enforcement before and who have negative experiences. And we produced a series of videos aimed at kids, teaching kids kids to know their rights when they come into contact with law enforcement and as deeply satisfying and so on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'PROJECT Ultimately, the goal is to take that kind of know your rights assembly your presentation into schools codes delayed that a little bit but that's the goal. The other type of work that I do around race equity is that I'm on the legal foundation of Washington's Race Equity Grants Panel, which is work that is really satisfying to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'me because we that panel meets at least twice a year and reviews grant applications for programs designed all over the state, actually designed to promote access to justice and equity in the courts and justice programs. And so the panel I'm on gets to review all those applications and make funding decisions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's satisfying not because I get to figure out how to spend money, but it's it's satisfying because I get to hear all the amazing work being done statewide on that issue. And I've done that, I think, for two or two or three years now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then additionally, I, I volunteer in the lab and see mock trial judging and the mock trial judge. And I really like to focus my outreach to students in those settings on students who might be interested in public service and make myself available to them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And colleagues, next question. All right. The next question is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How is it? Maybe I'm getting it off the hook.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the subcommittee, you were asked to describe what your previous coworkers and would say is your greatest weakness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please describe what you believe to be your greatest strength and how it would make you successful if appointed to this position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, I think I think a couple of things. My. I think one of my greatest strengths relevant to this position is my decades experience working with people who have substance abuse and mental health issues. Because I and I guess we can put that all under the rubric of social work training, because as a social worker, I'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'trained to think in systems and systems and organizations and then think in terms of how individually how a person interacts with all of the systems in their lives. So I, I can't help but think in terms of a work flow process, operations way to do things the way we do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I have a really strong sense of the treatment resources in our community. I understand that we don't have treatment on demand. Maybe one day we will. But I understand the barriers that, for example, criminal defendants sentenced to participate in those services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand the barriers they may face in accessing those services. And then to take it down sort of on more of a micro level, I think my social work training and my experience as a public defender really are going to enable me as a judge to see clearly the person in front of me and see what it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is that we need to do to help that person so that we can reduce recidivism and make us all safer. Those are those are things I've been doing for over 20 years as a lawyer and social worker is trying to interrupt the recidivist cycle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that's a particular strength.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Colleagues, are there any follow up questions? Then I would invite you to share your closing, if you will. And again, ask you to shoot for 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. So, you know, each of us is the sum of our choices and our experiences and. I'd like to share with you on experience. I had that stayed with me now for almost 25 years because it's deeply meaningful to me when my first job out of social work, graduate school was as a social worker in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a Latino nursing home, and one evening a patient was dying. And one day I called the priest. We customarily use his Spanish, but he wasn't available. So I called the next time I'm down on the list and that priest came very quickly, but he did not speak Spanish.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I showed him to the patient's door. And as I turned to leave, he waved me inside the room and then asked me to interpret last rites. And I froze. I was terrified. I had never done that before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What if I can stay Catholic, etc. but I didn't really have long to contemplate that because the priest grabbed my hand and began speaking and direct and he grabbed the dying man's hand. And so I began interpreting and I spent a little bit of time worrying I wasn't doing this right, etc. Since I've mentioned it pretty quickly'",
        "'speaker_1': ', I looked at the man and I saw that his face went. It went from pain and fear to comfort and peace. And I it struck me in that moment, this is not about me. This is about doing it perfectly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's about showing up in a moment. That's scary and challenging for somebody who needs me to be there and. It's not about me, and that's an experience I have taken with me through the last 24, 25 years in public service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I guarantee you that if I get on the district court bench, if I should be so lucky that every person in front of me who appears in front of me. I'm going to see them. I'm going to show up and be present.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they're going to know that. I know it's not about me as a judge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. No, thank you. I will now ask the clerk to admit Mrs. Shotwell into the waiting room and invite back in. Miss Dylan. Is the shot well in the waiting room now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, Mrs. Thatcher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are ready with the second candidate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Miss Dillon, thank you very much for joining us today. Again, thank you for your interest in serving on the King County District Court in the West District. I want to welcome you to the full committee, the hall today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I begin by inviting you to share your opening remarks and ask you to shoot for 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Good morning to you and the rest of the council. My name is called Gender Dillon. It is an honor and a privilege to appear before the council this morning. I am the daughter of East Indian immigrants who left India to find work and opportunities to build a better life for themselves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My parents settled in England in the 1960s. My family faced discrimination because of how they looked, what they wore, and how they sounded. In England, my father drove the city bus and my mother was a seamstress and raised three children.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My parents dream was to open their own business. They instilled values of hard work, education and giving back to the community. My parents were able to buy their first home with grants from the government. My parents saved and were able to achieve their dream of buying their own business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A small grocery store in Edinburgh, Scotland. Unlike many clients I have represented over the last 17 years as a public defense lawyer and a private defense attorney. My story of coming to the United States is a story of privilege.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My uncle sponsored our family through the family lottery system, and in 1990 we received our permanent residence cards. I moved to the United States when I was 17 years old. My parents followed a few years later. I'm the first person in my immediate family to get a college degree and an advanced degree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During college, I gave back to the community that I lived in by volunteering at a domestic violence shelter. I started to understand the power of a new language, the language of the law, and how that how the law could be used to ensure safety for those escaping abusive relationships.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I moved to King County 30 years ago, it was not the multicultural county it is today. Today, King County ranks as one of the wealthiest counties in the country. However, wealth and security are not equally distributed. Today, King County faces problems of homelessness, a looming eviction crisis due to the global pandemic and racial disparities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We see many of these issues playing out in our courts. There is much work to be done, but it is my hope that we continue to reevaluate and reimagine the justice system and use recent development and technology as an access to justice tool.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe my unique experiences and perspectives are a valuable addition to the King County bench, and it is my hope that the parties who come before me and the community as a whole see in me a reflection of our diverse county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope this leads to people having a greater trust in the legal system. And I am happy to answer your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our first question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pardon me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a member of Cowell's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair, and welcome. And very good to see you again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good morning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My question is, what do you see as the most critical issue facing or is there crisis facing? And what do you believe that the role of district court judges is in addressing this most critical issue?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much and nice to see you again as well. And. I believe there are a number of critical issues that the district court faces at this time. And just to give you some background, I have been sitting as a pro tem judge for the last three years in the King County district court system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have been invited to sit in each division, and I usually sit for 2 to 3 days a week. And during the pandemic, I have been sitting for weeks at a time in all the different divisions. And I do sit in the West District as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I what I have noticed is that COVID 19 obviously has had a tremendous impact on our courts. And the COVID 19 pandemic has caused a tremendous backlog of the cases that are waiting to be tried. It is my understanding from the bench bar meetings with defense counsel, private defense counsel at the prosecutor's office that there are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'over 2000 unfilled misdemeanor cases in King County District Court that have not been filed. Obviously, that will take a number of years to work through this backlog. Another issue that faces the district court is the lack of alternatives for incarceration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is no work that is active. There's no work community work crew. As an alternative to pardon me that the judges can use. There's also limited places that court users can do community service and perform their community service hours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, the community court has been closed, but it is going to be opening hopefully fairly soon. And the court and the community court has also expanded. I also believe that another issue that the district court faces is the digital divide that folks are struggling with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In my experience as a pro tem judge, the people that I'm seeing who are physically coming to the court are from the Bipoc community and English language learners. Some of those issues the courts have addressed, and in my role as a judge, I've addressed the issue regarding the digital divide by speaking with using interpreters to let people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'know that they are welcome to use digital platforms and if they have capabilities. I've also spoken to people about alternate, how they can use digital platforms with their substance use treatment providers. We've had a number of substance use treatment providers who have logged on with their clients, and that has been really a terrific.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the ways that I educate people in non-English speakers about the digital platforms is to ask interpreters if they have the time to and if the court doesn't have the digital platform instructions printed in their native language to go into one of the Zoom breakout rooms and help users understand the instructions on how to log on'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And the interpreters are very happy to do this very quickly. In terms of community service, the Court has we have gotten very creative with what community service means. In the past. Community service was done at not for profit organizations in the community, but because of the COVID 19 pandemic, a lot of community service organizations were not able'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to have people do community service. And in the ways that people did prior to COVID, I have engaged with people who I have sentenced to do community service and helped them think outside of the traditional box. And I have helped them figure out what things that they are interested in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then using the skills that I have developed in my private practice and as well as my knowledge of community services, I have helped court users understand that they are able to do community service and organizations online. So the court has been creative of accepting online community service with organizations that have helped benefit people such as community'",
        "'speaker_1': 'passageways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Colleagues, council member Balducci.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Mr. Chair, and it's very nice to meet you and thank you for replying and congratulations on making it to be a finalist. I like to call out one thing in each application that that really spoke to me in ten years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was I was taken by your experience working with victims and domestic violence advocacy and your involvement with the immigrant and refugee community right after that really tragic shooting in our own courthouse and just below where we would be sitting if we were doing this in person.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for your work in that regard. And I think that gives you an interesting view on the entirety of the criminal justice system. Like often is, please describe how you have incorporated equity and social justice principles into your work in the justice system and how that work would be furthered if you were appointed to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'position. Thank you so much for your words and. I have. I think before I answer your question specifically with examples of what I've done to address disproportionality and bias in the justice system, I do want to take a moment to say that I have been affected emotionally by the horrors of what we have seen over on our'",
        "'speaker_1': 'television screens and our cell phone screens over the last year. And I do appreciate you, council member Balducci, for making a statement about the fact that people who were from Asian-American communities have been singled out and have been assaulted and racist vitriol has been lobbed at them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to answer your question, when I was a defense counsel, lead defense counsel in juvenile drug court, which is a therapeutic court in juvenile court, superior court, I worked collaboratively with the prosecutor and to restructure policies regarding sanctions and drug courts and violations and terminations from drug court in order to reduce youth incarceration and racial disproportionality.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also worked collaboratively with the drug court team to implement evidence, evidence based interventions and supports to make sure that services that the youth were receiving were culturally appropriate. I also worked in juvenile court in the juvenile system with prosecutors, defense attorneys, schools and probation counselors to end incarcerating youth on status offenses and specifically truancy cases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I worked to strengthen interventions prior to those cases actually coming to court. Some of the community organizations that we worked with were Choose 180 and Community Passageways. And through that work, the number of truancy cases that were actually filed in court dropped dramatically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've also taking taken a number of trainings in cultural competency and bias, particularly implicit bias and its impact on jurors. I've used the information that I've learned through those trainings in my practice and as a pro tem judge, and I work very hard to recognize my own biases and to set them aside when when they're influencing my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'decisions. Also, in the work that I that I do as a pro tem, it's really important to me that the people who come before the court understand the resources that are available to them. I will say just anecdotally, my parents have lived in English speaking countries for 50 years and they are very proud of their their ability'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to speak English. But there are still times, and especially in the medical system, that they too need interpreters. I use that anecdotal story, too, to tell people who come before me that that even though they are they speak English quite well, it is imperative that they use an interpreter to understand what is happening in court, and so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that I can understand what they are trying to say if they are representing themselves. So I remind court users that they are entitled to use interpreters for their probation appointments as well as during the entire court process. Also, I'm active in the community through the South Asian Bar Association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also mentor young lawyers, and when I say young, I should say I'm sorry. I should correct myself and say folks who are just entering the legal profession or or who are just are still in law school. And and that's really rewarding work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think all those experiences and the work that I've done collaboratively help me, will help me in my role to work with the partners in the justice system. Thank you so much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And colleagues. All right. I'll have the last prepared question, and that is in the subcommittee. You were asked to describe what your previous coworkers would say is your greatest weakness. Please describe what you believe to be your greatest strength and how it would make you successful if you were appointed to this position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much for the question. I don't know if it was if it's cheating to use the same weakness as a for but I do think especially with the backlog of cases that the King County District Court faces, I do think that my strong work ethic is definitely needed at this time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And but to answer your question directly, I think that my coworkers probably would say that one of my strengths is the fact that I am able to listen to people and connect with them on a deep level. I pride myself on being able to speak to people and make them feel comfortable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've had a number of jobs that have helped me do that. I've been working since I was 11 years old. First at my parents grocery store, I sold shoes. I have made sausages. I've waited tables at some of our finest restaurants in Seattle.'",

And I've also worked as private as a private defense attorney. So I understand some of the challenges that the private bar faces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I also have work to the public defense attorney. I think these different roles that I've had will make me a strong partner on the bench. And I believe that my the letters that I've had written that that is included in my materials are varied there from judges, defense attorneys and prosecutors and community partners that I've worked'",

        "'speaker_3': 'How will you handle something like that when you see a recidivism coming through like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In such a short.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Timespan? Thank you for your question, Councilmember Lambert. You know, that is an issue that we struggle with every day. I do sit on the felony first appearance calendar as well as the first appearance calendars in the district court and arraignment calendars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we do unfortunately see recidivism and people who have come before the court on a short period of time. And undoubtedly the council is aware that our crime statistics have increased dramatically. Many of those cases where the crime statistics have increased are under the purview of the Superior Court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can assure you that with respect to violent crimes, the judges are bound by the rules that govern pretrial release, which require that I make specific findings of either a danger to the community or a likelihood of flight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if I'm appointed, I will commit to be bound by those standards and rules in making bail decisions. And obviously, it will play into the step into my decision making, the number of times that a person has appeared in court in terms of nonviolent offenses, I will say that the district court is does a very good job'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It's been a rewarding, challenging and enriching experience. I have a reputation. Pardon me? I have earned the respect of the judges. And I am asked to sit on voluminous and difficult calendars, both criminal and civil. I have a reputation for honesty, integrity and fairness.'",

I am a former president of the District and Municipal Court Judges Association, and I'm currently the representative from the District and Municipal Court Judges Association to the Board for Judicial Administration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the last 11 years, my job has been to provide equal, fair and thoughtful and compassionate justice to the people of federal way and statewide. I had the experience and the passion to do this job and to bring these this experience to King County District Court.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And I have to admit, she probably studied harder and she did get better grades than both my sister and I. My family raised me to believe that my job should be to help other people and to help to make the world better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what kind of job would I do to make that happen? I did a lot of internships to find out what my interests were, where my skills lay. And I landed as a victim advocate for both the Seattle Police Department and King County District Court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I realized that the criminal justice system was where I wanted to be. I was a prosecutor for cities of Kent and Seattle for nine years, and while I was a prosecutor, I realized that I really could effectuate better justice as a judge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I started to protest in King County District Court, and in 2009, I was elected as a full time judge in federal way. As you may know, Federal Way is one of the busiest municipal courts in the state. We process thousands of thousands of cases per year.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much and good to have you with us again. Thank you. And I have a question that is, what do you see as the most critical issue facing the courts? And what do you believe the role of the judges is in terms of addressing this most critical issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In current times? The most critical issue is how we respond to the pandemic and all other times are most critical issue is handling the mental health, homelessness, drug addiction crisis is happening all over the country. The pandemic simply makes all of these things harder.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The judge's role is to work with all of the executives and the councils across the state to really make the courtroom a safer place so that we can continue the business of delivering justice. That we have had a difficult year doing that, but we have risen to that challenge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most of us are on Zoom court or doing a hybrid Zoom court. We are allowing people to continue cases out longer. We are making our courtroom safer with various PPE devices, etc. And we are also understanding that as it is harder for us, it is also harder for everyone appearing before us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those who are addressing their mental health or addiction issues are having a harder time because those organizations have been affected by the pandemic as well. The judge's role is to really lead the entire court in responding to these issues, to understand the issues that the defense attorneys and the prosecutors are having as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And certainly to understand the issues that this pandemic is causing for the folks who appear before us. Most of them have been economically affected by this pandemic, and that's something that we have to recognize and address as well.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair and Judge Roberts. And it's very nice to meet you. Thank you so much for being interested in this position at King County. And I'd just like to make an observation about each of the candidates.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You obviously stand out by virtue of your judicial experience. You have a lot. And I was taken, by the way, in your recommendations, you see that you're kind of a judges judge, that other municipal judges look to you as a a resource and a supporter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that that speaks, I think, to the level of respect that you have developed in your career. So I think you just wanted to share that. I had noted that. And that's that stands out. The question is you're welcome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The question is, please describe how you have incorporated equity and social justice principles into your work in the justice system and how that work would be further if you were appointed to this position. So I think the first thing is to acknowledge that racial inequities and social inequities exist and they exist in the justice system, they exist'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in society before people even get to the courts. They have experienced a number of these inequities, and that's something that courts always have to recognize and look beyond what you see on paper to understand what someone has gone through, what their experiences have been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a simple recognition is the first step. Secondly, I have educated myself as much as I can on what these social and racial inequities are, how I may recognize them, how I address implicit or explicit bias in my courtroom, and the best practices for having to dealing with those inequities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's very scary for anyone to appear in court, but when you feel that society has everything stacked against you and you've never been treated fairly, it becomes even worse. So it's part of my job to explain the process to people, to explain to them that they are going to be treated fairly, to do so at every opportunity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to acknowledge what they've gone through in the system. And I will take my 11 years of experience doing this and learning about this and federal way to King County, where I would hope that I would assist my colleagues in continuing this learning process about how to best address all of these inequities.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I believe that my greatest strength, and I've heard this from people who appear before me is my ability to listen. I don't believe that the job of a judge is to lecture. The job of the judge is to listen to the people who appear before, before the judge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I really spend a lot of time listening to what people have to tell me so that I can make a more thoughtful and appropriate decision when they appear before me. One of my other strengths is being able to efficiently run a courtroom and run a calendar.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when you have an extremely busy court such as Federal Way or King County District Court, that's important because. How long a court runs or how well it's run does have effect on the rest of the court and on the attorneys and on the defense attorneys and people who are appearing before you are taking time out of'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. For the record on Mary Burke and on from the council staff and the materials for this item begin on page 59 of your packet. In addition, there are two amendments that are proposed for today's meeting that were sent separately in a supplemental packet yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The proposed ordinance would require hazard pay of $4 per hour for grocery workers who work at grocery business locations that meet three conditions which you can see outlined at the bottom of page 59 of the staff report. Those conditions are first, that the grocery business is located in unincorporated King County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Second, in terms of size, that the grocery business is either over 10,000 square feet, primarily engaged in the retail sale of groceries or over 85,000 square feet with 30% or more of floor area dedicated to the retail sale of groceries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in terms of employee count, that the grocery business has at least one employee working at the location in unincorporated King County and employs 500 or more employees worldwide, regardless of where those employees are employed. And the ordinance is written that this includes but is not limited to chains, integrated enterprises or franchises.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This ordinance is written that it would expire at the termination of the proclamation of emergency for the COVID 19 pandemic that King County executive Dow Constantine issued on March 1st, 2020. Moving forward, I will note that given both the executive's and the governor's emergency proclamations of about a year ago, which the council commemorated yesterday on March 23rd'",
        "'speaker_1': ', the governor issued a proclamation, the stay home, stay healthy order that closed nonessential workplaces and banned gatherings. Since that time, although the governor has adjusted restrictions on gatherings and workplaces, essential businesses have remained open. And you can find a list of the essential businesses identified in the Governor's Order in attachment three to the Staff Report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Moving down to the bottom of page 60, hazard pay is something that is defined by the United States Department of Labor as additional pay for performing hazardous duty or work involving physical hardship. National reporting has indicated that many employers provided hazard pay at the start of the pandemic, but that most have since phased out hazard pay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In response, a number of local jurisdictions have implemented hazard pay ordinances during the last several months. And you can see a list on page 61 of some of the West Coast jurisdictions that have done so, including Seattle and Berrien, Washington, as well as Long Beach, Los Angeles and Oakland, California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Each of these ordinances, like the proposed King County Ordinance, have limited durations tied to local emergency orders.

This compares to the Seattle and Berrien ordinances in that obviously both of those refer to just grocery businesses within their jurisdictions, whereas King County's would be for the unincorporated area where King County is the local government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll also note that while the Seattle ordinance has enforcement and regulation to be managed by its Office of Labor Standards for King County, since there is no such entity, enforcement would be managed by providing that employees or entities representing employees could bring civil action in court if they felt that their right to hazard pay has not been'",

        "'speaker_1': ', alliances and brand names of stores, even where individual locations might be individually operated and owned.

        "'speaker_1': 'are located. You will also see in that attachment about ten pages of grocery businesses that would meet the terms of the ordinance, except for the fact that they are located in incorporated areas. Those are organized by district just so that council members can see if there is anything that you believe is missing from your district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll note in terms of the impact on grocery businesses both nationally and across Washington state. According to the Census Bureau, grocery sales have increased during the pandemic by about 11.3%. And based on earnings reports from some of the larger national chains, grocery business profits have increased as well during this time period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That said, staff do not have an easy way to identify potential profits or sales from individual grocery business locations. That is because the Washington State Department of Revenue does not collect gross business income for specific business locations, but rather for the entirety of a business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in addition, King County receives sales tax information only for items that are subject to the sales tax, which would obviously excluding food, not include most sales at grocery stores. And in addition, aggregates that sales tax information, so it's not easily disaggregated to individual locations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That said, I will note that of the ten locations staff identified, approximately half are part of larger national chains.

        "'speaker_1': 'retail workers and found that they are at higher risk of COVID 19, particularly for those who interact with customers on a regular basis. In addition, this research noted that 76% of infected grocery employees had no symptoms, suggesting that those employees could be a source of asymptomatic infection.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will note again that this ordinance requiring hazard pay would expire upon the termination of the governor. This I'm sorry, the executive's emergency order. And I'll also note, and you can see outlined on page 66 that grocery workers would most likely be eligible for vaccination in phase one B tiers two and four, which would begin to cover'",
        "'speaker_1': 'workers who are either 50 years and older or 50 years and younger who are in occupations considered high risk. Now, it is unclear at this point what the status of grocery workers might be given the governor's announcement of expediting vaccinations for educators yesterday, or the follow up announcement that workers in essential congregate situations such as grocery workers'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would also be expedited to some level. We're waiting for further guidance from the Department of Health on that. Moving on. On page 67, staff also studied potential community access to food. In other words, if a grocery business that is required to pay hazard pay determines that it must close as a result of that, what would happen to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the community? To do this analysis, staff used two metrics used by the United States Department of Agriculture or USDA to study communities with limited food access. And the USDA uses metrics for both low income census tracts that either have a poverty rate equal to or greater than 20%, or a median family income that is 80% or less'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the metropolitan areas, median family income, and looks at a metric that they call low access, which are census tracts in which at least 500 people and or 33% of the census tracts populations may have more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store in an urban area or more than ten miles in rural areas'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Based on these metrics and using the USDA Food Access Research, Atlas staff identified that of the ten potential grocery business locations identified as being potentially affected by the proposed ordinance. Four of them are located in census tracts that meet the USDA's definition of low income, and you can see those in attachment six of the packet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In terms of the level of access to food, using the low access metric, staff identified that in 2010 there were four of the ten census tracts that would meet that definition, and in 2015, three of them would. Now, because it's sort of impossible to say, well, a store now exists and may affect whether a census tract is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'determined to be low access or not. What staff also did, and you can see this in attachment five, is mapped each of the potentially affected grocery stores and the surrounding area and listed the distance to comparable grocery stores so that you can see is it a half mile to miles, six miles to the closest grocery store?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that information is all available. I will note that there has been litigation brought to both the Seattle and BURIAN ordinances, and we do have legal counsel on the line who would be prepared to discuss litigation issues in executive session if desired.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will again just close by noting again that this ordinance would be terminated upon the termination of the Executive's March 1st, 2020 Proclamation of Emergency. I'll note again that there are two amendments happy to pause now and take questions or move into the amendments, if you'd prefer, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Union Council member LAMBERT Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a question I got during testimony the other day that the person testifying from the shore industry said that they had divided outreach help from grocery and that. But 6% of the employees in grocery were susceptible and 20% in the government sector.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you help me remember the background on that? Because in here it looks like they're more susceptible in the grocery sector than retail or government. And I don't remember that being what we heard in testimony the other day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So can you help me remember that? Thank you, Councilmember. I can't speak to the testimony that you heard the other day. I can simply cite the sources that staff used, which again was a British medical study that looked at particularly a group of grocery retail workers at a store in Massachusetts last year and identified the findings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can see on page 65 of the staff report as well as information from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the impacts to people of color who are predominantly represented in frontline or essential industries. So I think one of the things the lady said the other day was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But some of those studies had been done in a conglomerate of all retail. And then it was just recently that they had because they were feeling that that data wasn't accurate to their sector to have them do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The last thing I want to say, it's a little concerning to me on page 67, we can't do anything about it, but it's kind of what I deal with on a regular basis. So we all deal with on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is the USDA characterized as low access tax of those in which at least 500 people in or 33% of the population reside more than one mile from a supermarket, a large grocery in the urban area, it's not in a rural area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's ten miles, ten miles to get to the grocery store. When you're 90 years old and somebody's taken away your driver's license, that's really quite upsetting. So I wanted to point that definition out because I think that's that's really very sad.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if this were to pass and one of the stores was to close as a result of this ordinance, what would happen to the people, you know, living in or served by hopefully, you know, with the new announcements from the president and the governor in the last 48 hours, this is going to be a short term thing'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But what if in the short term timeframe we lose one of these stores and then there isn't a store coming out on the other end? One of the stores in question is across the street from a senior center, a senior living area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I am very concerned that those seniors would not be able to get to the store. You might remember a number of years ago I tried to see if we could have golf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To move the people from their house to the grocery stores. And so, you know, we weren't able to do that for a number of reasons because there's a major road going there. But I still think that we need to look at that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm very concerned that the ramifications to the senior community could be devastating. So I just want to put that on the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Lambert, in responding to your point about the distance to define food deserts, they point out that I'm representing rural areas myself. If we had a grocery store within every mile of each other with no longer be rural, we'd be dramatically changing the character.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People choose to live in rural communities and accept that part of living in rural communities, being rural and having more distance to go for such services. Further questions of mayors on Councilmember Bell Duty.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. We had been working in my office on the definition of employees that are covered. I had some question in my mind reading the proposal about whether there might be unintended consequences in terms of including employees that are obviously not intended to be covered.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the discussions in a different jurisdiction was about whether it covered people working in a home office. You know, in the headquarters office, truck drivers, etc. and it out. That work really didn't lead to an amendment, but I thought there was going to be an amendment, and I see that there is not one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Mary, could you just speak a little bit about the definition that's in the proposal as it sits today? Sure. Thank you, Councilmember. So the definition of grocery employee can be found in the ordinance on page 74 of your packet, starting at line 134.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it reads Grocery employee means a person employed by a grocery employer and works at a grocery business. And this gets a little circular, but grocery business is defined further up in the amendment at line 119 as a retail store operation located in unincorporated King County and then has the square footage requirements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this clearly would not cover someone working at a home office. I think the question of whether it might cover, say, you know, a truck driver who serves that store would be questionable. You know, I guess it would cover them for the point of time that they were working at that grocery location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is pretty clearly defined to those specific grocery businesses in unincorporated King County. Certainly, if the council wished to amend this to add more specific, clarifying language about which employees would be affected, that could be done. That's helpful to know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't have more questions at this time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See. No more questions. Very few brief amendments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So in the separate packet that you were sent yesterday with the amendments, there are two. Amendment one, which is sponsored by Councilmember Balducci, would state that the council intends to review the need for the ordinance three months after it takes effect and may choose to repeal all or part of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then it adds clarifying language that states that if the Council does not act to repeal the ordinance, it would expire upon the termination of the executive's emergency proclamation. So then moving on. Amendment two, which is sponsored by Councilmember, I would exempt from the requirements of this ordinance a grocery business location that meets four criteria.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, that it is located in what is defined as a limited food access community, defined as a low income, historically underserved community that has one or no grocery businesses within its census tract that it is independently owned and operated with that owner having four or less locations operating simultaneously, that it is over two miles from the closest'",
        "'speaker_1': 'grocery business location that would satisfy the terms of the ordinance in terms of size and employment threshold, and that that location has less than 25 employees regularly working there. So those are the two amendments, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Senior questions on the amendments and having nothing before us now. I would call on the prime sponsor, Councilmember Dombrowski. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and I appreciate my colleagues patience as we work through a good, long meeting today with a lot of issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate members attention to this legislation and the excellent staff report, which is, I think allowed us to digest the issues and reflect on where we might be on it and if it would be in order. Mr. Chair, I would move adoption with a do pass recommendation of proposed ordinance 2020 1-0093.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion is before us. Thank you. I'll just speak if I could briefly get to it. Yesterday, the council adopted a proclamation sponsored in part by Councilmember Dunn, but signed by all members and the county executive. Reflecting on the past year in which we've been living with and responding to this pandemic, which has killed 500,000 Americans and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'tested our systems of government and society. And in that proclamation, we honored and recognized frontline workers, essential workers, including grocery store workers. And I think that that recognition was appropriate. This industry has been essential. And by that I mean our food industry and ensuring that we are able to deliver this essential function of feeding our community and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the council's priorities in response to the pandemic. Housing, security and food security have been the top two areas of focus among those that we've identified. We really engaged in it. We cannot deliver this essential food without both the industry, but also workers who fill the stores and who frankly have shown up every day for the last year'",
        "'speaker_0': 'putting their health and safety at risk. You can't do it all for yourself. You can't do it on the farm. And without them, we couldn't be providing the food security to them, to the community that we need. So why should we pay them more for doing this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And why should government mandated? I think those are two real questions that are called to be addressed by this legislation. First, with respect to why government should do it, I think that we in our country have now, for over a century, a long history of bringing forth action by government to protect and support workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is an imbalance of power between the worker and the employer, and the equalizer in that equation can be and has been in our system, the government looking out for the broader good. We regulate workplace safety conditions. We regulate wages and hours with minimum wages and overtime.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is an area that the government engages in and has in our country for a more than a century. And in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Particular, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would say that the concept of hazard pay is well recognized and even our federal government. You go to the Department of Commerce and they have adopted regulations in the court of federal regulations to give somebody to give workers, quote, hazard pay when they are undertaking duties that were not originally contemplated when they started the job because of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'increased exposure to health risks, among other other things. And the code of federal regulations authorizes increased pay for hazardous duty, and that has occurred here in similar effect. We've got workers in the grocery stores carrying out this function who are putting their lives and those of their families that they go home to on the line.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think in this case, that it is appropriate to recognize that on a limited, short term basis, this legislation would expire concurrently with the ending of the emergency proclamation, or assuming that that comes from Refugees Amendment. If the Council looks at it in 90 days and said we want to make a change or or alter it'",
        "'speaker_0': ', that kind of component, but it's limited in nature. It responds to this particular need, and I think it's the right thing to do. A number of other jurisdictions, of course, have done it for Seattle and Palm Beach, California, L.A. County and others.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we're not we wouldn't be, I would say, going out on a limb here. So for those reasons, Mr. Chair, I hope that the council will take this up with our values here that we have and keep telling and supporting frontline workers and have really supported us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Colleagues. Amendments. Councilmember Bell Dewji.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Amendment One.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amendment, what is before us? Councilmember Bell DEWJI.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's been very succinctly and correctly briefed. This has been looking at this overall, and I'll speak to the ordinance as a whole on final passage. But I took a good hard look at implementation questions and, you know, making sure that it's clear and and can be implemented because the last thing we would want'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would be for there to be confusion and have people be disappointed and or not know what we're expecting them to do. So this the purpose of this amendment would be to just give us a moment in time, a fixed moment in time when we could take action if we choose to not take action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The ordinance continues by its term until the terminates by its terms, but especially given the announcements over the last few weeks and how quickly things are changing, we now have at least a credible promise that possibly every adult in America will be vaccinated within 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and we see that the cases have been coming down and the hospitalizations have been going down. Of course, all of this could change, right? Like everything changes very quickly in this pandemic. So I would not want to rely on that and say changes the expiration date.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think we should take a good look and a reasonable but short period of time. And where are we at now as is necessary to continue? And that's the idea behind the amendment. Thank you for considering it, colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The discussion on Amendment One. I like it. It's well thought out. Thank you for all those and see no further discussing all this in favor of please say I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Am.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Opposed. Nay, the ayes have it. Amendment one is adopted. Council members are alive. I move amendment to Mr. Chair. Amendment two is before us council members. Hello. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Councilmember Dombrowski, for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you to the unions who have been supporting this. I'm very much in support of hazard pay and will be voting yes on this this ordinance. I've proposed a very limited exemption that would exempt grocery stores located in very limited food access communities that are low income, historically underserved communities, and where the grocery stores are independently owned'",
        "'speaker_0': '. They're not part of this, these big national chains that have been making record profits because of the pandemic. I think that the fact that, as Mary mentioned, it's more difficult to understand the financials of each specific store and the fact that if anything were to happen to a grocery outlet, for example, we would further create a food'",
        "'speaker_0': 'desert. If you looked at the map that Mary provided, there aren't any other grocery stores in Skyway. So when we're dealing with a community that 70% people of color that has the highest proportion of African-Americans in the state of Washington, that many people don't have a car to get around and drive to the next closest grocery store'",
        "'speaker_0': ', which is not in Skyway. I just want to be very careful about this very limited situation. Otherwise, I'm very much in favor of this ordinance and believe that we need to pay our workers who are been enduring all kinds of risk, putting their bodies on the line to feed our communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Further discussion. Mr. Dombrowski, I want to thank councilmembers, our ally for working collaboratively on this. And it was an issue that we identified when looking at the legislation. And of course, the history of that grocery outlet is that it took a lot of work to get it there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The one in Skyway, it was empty. The community was without a grocery store for a long time because the big folks, frankly, wouldn't come in because the margins weren't there, the profitability wasn't there. And so I think this amendment under the precautionary principle is well taken.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and we'll be supporting it because we don't want to do harm. And so I think it's very narrowly tailored and well done. Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have a technical question and then I have a comment. Could you tell me online 45 with the is? I've never seen one like that. Usually when you have hammered out with the rest of the line is there. So what is that on line 45?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember. What this represents, it's just the way that amendments are written because there are new sections being inserted. This is just instruction to the code revise or that when they add those new definitions in. We have to remember that there are two things going in in between two other things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we have to keep adding new letters and so that it's just instruction to the code. Revise here. Okay. I usually see the rest of the statement, but so that yeah. That, that is not there because it's not changing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is just telling the code revise or, you know, put this in here and then what had been l is now going to become M okay. So I agree with the statement of the previous speakers, the idea that we don't want to be creating food deserts and I too have a similar situation in my district where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the access issue for transportation is very serious and it pertains to seniors. And also we have a lot of people of color in the area that are low income also. So and we don't have good transportation for the bus in that area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there are a lot of issues where I want to make sure we aren't creating a food desert. So I was hoping that this amendment would say that all low access areas in the county would be treated equally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I will be voting and supporting this, but I will hope to have an amendment for council that will say that all low accesses can be treated equally. So. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms.. Bergeron. Cannot I ask? What what locations are identified in the staff report? We might think this amendment identifies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes. So the the belief is and I'm just going to scroll to the appropriate attachment here. The belief is, after much quality time spent on the USDA's Food Access Research Atlas, that this amendment could potentially apply to two of the locations identified in Attachment four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One would be the grocery outlet and skyway that meets all of the, you know, owner operated size, income and distance criteria. The other potential, although I do not know for sure, is the Red Apple Dominick's, which is located in District eight that appears to meet the low income, independently owned and operated and the distance criteria.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am not certain about the employee account and I actually have to confess I am not certain how many outlets that owner of that particular Red Apple owns. So that one is potentially affected by this amendment? Not 100% clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hope that's helpful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yes. Further discussion of amendment to. Mr. WELLS.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr.. QUESTION Thank you, Mr. Chair, of Council Members online and anybody else. But one concern I have here is that you have individuals who are working in grocery stores, are front line employees, putting their health and safety at risk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And at one store they would be able to get this hazard pay and then another store they will not be able to. And I'm just wondering if you have a response to that, to provide some comfort to me about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you. Councilmember Caldwell's. So. This grocery outlet is not owned by the national grocery outlet. It's independently owned. The national grocery outlet is just their wholesale seller. So financially they are basically independent from the national one. And so I would look at it in terms of which ones are owned by this specific grocery outlet rather than'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the national grocery outlet. And these owners own just the Skyway one and a rent and one. And of course the rent and one wouldn't be impacted by our King County legislation, since it's a different city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I. Mr. Chairman, go on, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I understand that. And I think that's a valid point. But my concern overall, again, is the individual workers at the stores who have their own one store, they get that hazard pay. The other store they do not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that's the question we can't answer here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You mean that other grocery outlets owned by the national chain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, or even our stores in their area might not be skyway, but it might be in other areas where there is the store that would be required to provide that hazard pay, and there might be a nearby store that would not have to provide that transit plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gotcha. Yeah, I would. My position would be that each of these stores has a different circumstances and as highlighted by the very limited requirements of this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I can speak more broadly to the legislation in that regard. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. If I might, as a member. TOMASKY Thank you, Councilmember Cornwell's appreciate the inquiry. I guess I'm I think it's a good question slash point. The way I think of it is assuming that that that you believe there is value in the hazard pay concept for frontline workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's we don't operate in a vacuum. Right. That there are these other competing public interest issues, public policy issues that we need to account for when adopting that policy for workers. And one is in an area where there may be low margin that could perhaps tip the financial picture of the operator to the red instead of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'black. The consequences of that are pretty significant in the communities identified by Council Members Alkalis amendment and that is you've reverted to Democrats creating a food desert in the Skyway West to one that isn't. We don't know the finances, but the risk of the food desert is real because that's what it was until grocery outlet came and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'council members. All my predecessor and his office worked very hard around zoning issues and development issues of the county to get that store in there to be viable. So I think of it as a as a a recognition that we're not operating in a vacuum, there aren't consequences, and that we want to mitigate against the risk of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'losing that fundamental service to the community of delivering food through this network. I don't know if that's helpful. Thank you, Councilmember de Basket. For the discussion on amendment to. See none of those in favor of amendment to please signify by saying hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those opposed? Nay, the ayes have it. Amendment two is adopted. Further discussion. On the on the legislation as amended. I will. I'm on my behalf. But I will say that I'm at this time of unprecedented profits for some national grocery chains to then discontinue making hazard pay for their employees, who we have seen documentation in the staff'",
        "'speaker_0': 'report and in pursuing since this legislation was introduced and over the last year of the pandemic, are at higher risk of contracting COVID 19. We need to step up in and encourage this type of support for frontline workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know that grocery workers are more at risk. And to use this type of legislation as a wedge in arguing that that's why they are closing stores in some hard hit neighborhoods. I think it is abhorrent on behalf of large corporations experiencing great profits during the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So very disappointed in how some of those actors have behaved. I think encouraging and supporting frontline workers in this legislation has great value. I would ask, and I think it would be the sponsor if you'd be willing to respond to a question about intent in that it be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Large, important, large stores and associations included, not individual ownership. Ms.. Brigadoon referenced in her staff report branding. And I think that might also apply depending on how ownership is structured. With some ideas and thrift ways in particular. Is it the intent to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Only apply to large own stores and not ones that might brand with other stores. Yes, Mr. Chair, it's my understanding and I'm happy to be corrected by Mary or legal counsel, but that the structure of the legislation applies to those larger entities and that a mere affiliation through a brand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This, for example, the main grocery outlet brand, if it's independently owned, it would it would still have to meet the criteria of the multiple stores and employees and square footage before the ordinance applied.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. This is Mary. I'll just jump in to note that in the legislation itself, on page 76, in your packet, starting at line 172, there is a section that describes how business entities that would otherwise be treated separately are, for the purposes of this ordinance, considered as either an integrated, an enterprise or, you know, categorized as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'part of their larger body. And factors that are considered in the ordinance the way it's drafted, which again, could be amended if this does not meet the intent of the council members, our degree of interrelation between the operations of multiple entities, the degree to which the entity share common management, centralized control of labor relations, degree of common'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ownership or financial control over the entities, and use of a common brand, trade, business or operating name. So, you know, it's I think it's that final point that might get to some of the thrift ways. As you know, some of the stores that are independently owned and operated but operate as part of a larger alliance or as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'grocery outlet does as a consignment to that larger entity. So again, this certainly could be amended. This was patterned after the legislation that was developed in Seattle and the way that they made their definition. But but those those are sort of the clarifying points that the ordinance makes about how do you determine if a grocery business is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'part of this ordinance or not part of it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I might add a legal question. There's some that's turning around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have legal counsel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my legal question is this. If when this passes, it is prospectively not retrospective. Is that correct? Councilmember. I know we have Steven Tapley from the prosecuting attorney's office here. I will just note that this is prospective only.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. And I thought one of our in-house attorney, not not in Pasadena, but one of our members who.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm covering more we're covering the intel is not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Giving legal advice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, no. The intel the makers that are being prospective only effective upon effectiveness of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I just want to make sure that, you know, I it does concern me that we're telling a business what they will pay because it could become a slippery slope. But hopefully with the new information that we have out and the parameters were put in because of amendment number one, that in 90 days is will be gone'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that this is the would that be able to make business decisions? Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to check that legality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Balducci.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, just a few comments on final passage. One of the things that we have all learned through this incredible last year that we've all lived through is, I think, and a renewed and deeper appreciation for the people and the things that make our everyday life possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm very grateful that I that I now carry around with me, as I think many people do, this idea that grocery workers are essential workers. But that was not something we used to say before a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and we learned it really clearly, because at first we were all so afraid. We didn't know if we were going to be able to buy food. We didn't know how things were going to stay open. And throughout all that time, all the uncertainty, not knowing how bad things were going to get and then how bad things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'actually did get over the last year at times. Every single time that any of us had to go and buy food for our families, there were grocery workers on the other end of those trips to help us get the groceries and feed our families so that we were able to say stay safe and healthy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we've talked a lot in government and news and public and private about about that gratitude that that new gratitude that we feel towards essential workers like grocery workers. But truthfully, it doesn't mean a whole lot unless you honor people's work with appropriate compensation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is when I mean, literally putting our money where our mouth is. And so that's why I appreciate this proposal that's been brought forward. That's why I support it. I, I want to answer just a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think a lot of questions have been answered, but that I have heard that have not been answered yet. So one of the questions I've heard about this is what if I'm a grocery operator who runs my business very safely?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've done everything I need to do with regard to each fact and improvements and and personal protective gear and making sure customers are wearing masks, etc., etc.. You know, why should I have to pay hazard pay when my workplace isn't hazardous?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I've done everything I should. I think this is just a definitional question. Hazard pay doesn't mean that the employer isn't doing everything they ought to do. In fact, I hope they all are, and I think that many of them are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hazard pay means that just by virtue of going out of your house and going to work every day and being around other people, regardless of what kind of protocols you put in place, there's a risk that somebody is taking on who's out in public working all the time, that those of us who get to work from home'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are not taking on. I've been asked why these employees and not other types of employees? Why not county employees? Why aren't we giving more hazard pay? Why aren't we do give Caterpillar some of our employees, especially the ones that are on the front line of actually responding to COVID patients.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And to me, the answer to that is that grocery workers, among all of the workers who are out there doing what they need to do every day are some of the lowest paid just by virtue of the occupation and the industry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so to provide a modest and temporary increase to their pay in recognition of the risk that the grocery workers have taken on for all of us, seems reasonable and fair. I do believe that it can be done without putting businesses out of business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I thought a whole bunch of businesses weren't going to be able to afford this, I wouldn't support it, but I do support it. So I'm happy to vote yes. And I do want to warn that there may be one more amendment at full council, and that's because there's some contingencies around what the implementation date is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kind of getting back to Councilmember Lambert's question, just by virtue of how we pass ordinances and how they take effect, it could happen on a certain date or it could happen on a contingent date, depending on whether the executive signs or doesn't sign or whatever happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So I may bring an amendment that says it will take effect on this day. So we will set a day that is, you know, at an appropriately short period of time, just like an ordinance would normally take effect on one of our two paths.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that way, everyone who's charged with implementing it will have a very clear sense on this day it starts. But I, I also want to thank Councilmember Dombrowski and the advocates for bringing this up, because I think it's important it's an important statement and important support that we should provide to important people in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome for the debate. Scene nine Councilmember Best Q2 clothes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the great debate today on the merits and opportunity to reflect with my colleagues about where we are and on this particular legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is broad legislation for the County Council. This is a big deal and I think for me anyway, sometimes I think if we don't reflect and pause and think and look at things from different angles, maybe we shouldn't be in this business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think we all do that. And I, after introducing it, was, you know, looking at the debate and really reflecting, is this the right thing? And and one of my advisers, as you all know, I think, is my dad.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And he happens to be the oldest former grocery store worker I know. As a teenager, he worked for Mr. Kreider, Kroger's store in Dallas, Oregon, delivering groceries and stocking the shelves. In fact, his dad, my granddad, said, I don't care if Mr. Crowder tells you to stock the shelves with the cans upside down and backwards, do it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'just as happily as if he told you to put them on the shelf, right side, up and forwards. In other words, he was the boss. But that was tough work and essential work. And I said, So, Dad, is this the right thing to do, paying four bucks an hour more?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And he didn't hesitate. He said, of course it is wearing their bust in their tails and working.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And dealing with the public. And and that was reassuring to me and gave me the comfort to know at least that that little check that I feel we are doing the right thing here today in courage member support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the opportunity to bring this forward today, Mr. Chair, on a very packed agenda that can help. Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Belushi. Councilmember Dan Belsky. Councilmember Dunn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council member Coles I Council member Lambert now council member of the group I like. Council member by night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The high.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'High Council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I might.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chairman. About a seven I's council members, Dunn and Lambert vote no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. By your vote, we've given it to pass recommendation to 2020 193 as amended, and we will expedite that to full council this coming Tuesday. I'm pleased we are going on the 4 hours of Oak Hill meeting and I want to apologize and express appreciation to Councilmember Up the Grove, whose district executive committee his staff has'"

    "Fireworks Regulations Ordinance.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'been delayed from his old low tape 1:00 search. We also have on today's agenda legislation addressing fireworks in unincorporated King County. You've heard it our last meeting from residents of unincorporated King County who are dramatically affected by this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm in fact, the testimony we heard was overwhelmingly in support. We had one person testify against one last time. Today, we heard from more people offering testimony on both sides of a allow me to note that a lot of the opposition to the ban today was from the industry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm from TNT, Fireworks and others. In no way if we had can we take action in and ban fireworks by the 4th of July this year? I'm giving the timing of implementing new legislation if we were to adopt it for council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a 30 day waiting period from the time it moves out of committee until it'd be taken up before council. I want to assure everyone this, that this legislation will not and cannot be in effect by this 4th of July.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it is imperative to me to make sure that we take up and address the life, health and safety issues that fireworks bring to unincorporated communities so we can make appropriate public policy decisions. This will be on our next agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And given the time and already delayed executive committee of the Fun District, we will not take up the legislation today without and having no other items on our agenda today. Mr. Clare throughout the month ago. Thank you. The Flood District Executive Committee will convene at 130.'"
