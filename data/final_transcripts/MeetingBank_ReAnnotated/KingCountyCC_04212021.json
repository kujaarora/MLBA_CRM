Part of it runs on a razor thin margin and provides support for the uninsured and everybody else, elements of our society that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'otherwise wouldn't have access to great care. So I think helping support the organization as it continues to balance the budget without calling upon the county to supplement its budget is extremely important. I was on the board when we built out the Ninth and Jefferson Building and I think the ability to expand the range of care that we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can give away with care we can give is essential as as the county continues to grow. So I'm really excited about those areas.'",

And you mentioned adding the knife and Jefferson and I've had the opportunity to be up there on a number of occasions, and that is a beautiful space for people and very respectful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I am really pleased the quality of care that Harborview is famous for. I am also pleased with the technology that you reach out to in so many ways with specialties like the Burn Unit and robotics. One of the units that I want to mention is that England bond issue that we just passed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's going to be a new behavioral health building, and I've seen the schematics of that. And it is so impressive to me what that is going to look like and the range of services and how thoughtfully that was put together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with the issues that we're having with mental illness, that building getting done on time and hopefully even a little bit early would be very helpful. I did teasingly ask if we could get keys to the building so we could come in and relax and enjoy the atrium.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And no, we don't get keys to the building, but it it is really a wonderful design and I am looking forward to seeing that be available to us as we work with the impacts of life in general. But post-COVID.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's one that I'll be looking forward to seeing more and hear more about as well as I know that the director of the unit currently has a lot of really good ideas that I'm looking forward to seeing implemented and potentially being a role model nationally.'",

Everybody works best when a picture is head on and has no movement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additionally, because faces change over time. Unlike fingerprints or DNA, the technology can trigger incorrect results by changing hairstyles, facial hair, body weight and the effects of aging. Research has also indicated that FRC may not be as accurate in reading the faces of certain demographic groups.'",

When the system learns from a demographically uneven pool of images, the error rate for the demographic groups less represented in the dataset increases.'",

The proposed ordinance defines facial recognition technology as any computer software or application, which assists in identifying or verifying the identity of an individual based on the physical characteristics of the individual's face.'",

He does not include the analysis of facial features to grant access to an electronic device or the use of redacting software to protect the privacy of an individual depicted in a recording intended for release or disclosure. Facial recognition information is also defined as any data or information obtained or derived from facial recognition technology.'",

This process would require county personnel to notify their direct supervisor that they received, used or gained access to facial recognition information and that they immediately delete the information subject to applicable laws.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any facial recognition information collected or derived in violation of the established ban would be considered unlawful to obtain. Violations of the established ban would constitute an injury to which a person subject to the violation may seek relief in court.'",

That concludes my report, Mr. Chair, except to say, as you mentioned earlier, there is an amendment amendment S1 makes a series of technical and formatting corrections to the body of the audience as recommended recommended by the code.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Council member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, I do have a couple of questions. Thank you, Nick, for the really outstanding report on this. Very thorough. I would appreciate it if you would describe to us how the ordinance before us differs from the legislation passed last year by the state legislature, and also how it differs from the bill passed by'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the Seattle City Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. The state law, which goes into effect on January 1st, 2021, requires that any state or local agency that wants to acquire, develop or use NRT must first of all say they do use different definitions. But for the committee's benefit, I'll just continue using the definitions that I've described.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If they want to acquire developer use FRC, they must first give notice to the state or local authority that it intends to do so. That agency must then develop an accountability report for how the FRC will be used and its impact on privacy and civil liberties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then that accountability report must be sent to the local authority who must make it publicly available. So in the county's case, a King County agency would need to notify the Council of its intent to use or develop FRC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we need to develop an accountability report and send to the council. And then the council will need to make that report available on its website. There are also in the state law. There are also prohibitions on the use of FRC by state and local government entities, as well as specific prohibitions on the use of FRC'",
        "'speaker_2': 'by law enforcement agencies. Under the state law, no government entity may use FRC to engage in ongoing surveillance, conduct real time or near time identification or or start persistent tracking. Unless a warrant has been obtained, exigent circumstances exist or a court or is detained for the sole purpose of locating or identifying a missing person or identifying a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'deceased person. For law enforcement agencies, they are prohibited from using the results of FRC as the sole basis to establish probable cause in a criminal investigation. However, results from FRC may be used in conjunction with other information lawfully obtained, and they are also prohibited from using FRC to identify an individual based on a sketch or manually produced'",
        "'speaker_2': 'image as to state law. Seattle Surveillance Ordinance Requires City Departments to prepare surveillance impact impact reports on all new and currently used technology that meets the ordinances definition of surveillance. The reports must include an in-depth review of privacy implications, especially relating to equity in community impact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the reports must then be reviewed by the City Council, who then vote to approve or deny the use of the surveillance technology. So in both the Seattle and state laws, there is a review process of the proposed technology.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. Whereas, proposed ordinance in 091 before you would outright ban in county administrative offices and executive departments from using technology that meets the definition of FRC or using facial recognition information. That would be the primary differences.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And just to clarify, if we had this situation where there were a missing child, for example, perhaps in another state or another county in the state or whatever. Would the county then not be refraining from being able to use that and notice if we had reason to suspect that that child was being held here?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know that we will not it would not be prohibited that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Be I would not be prohibited from using any help in the identification and location of that missing child.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to. See no further questions. I'd like to actually invite Councilmember Caldwell's, if she would like, as prime sponsor, to make any remarks before we take questions and more general questions and conversation from colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, I would like to make a few, and I hope you'll indulge me. I think we can time. I'd like to speak for several minutes because that's some, I think some very informative material. First of all, as was mentioned by NEC, this ordinance would ban the use of facial recognition and code for King'",
        "'speaker_1': 'County Sheriff's Office and other county agencies. And unless I'm mistaken, I do not believe we have heard from the sheriff's office opposing this legislation. And as you heard, a ban would not affect the private sector. It is strictly applicable to county government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The what really concerns me here, get down to the bottom line here. Without the rapid advancement and sophistication of facial recognition technology, and I'll just refer to this effort to in the last several years has raised concerns over issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It certainly raised concerns on my part. And these concerns focused on the accuracy or lack of accuracy of the technology, demographic biases and encroachment on civil liberties. But also, I'm concerned about what is being done with the data.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have you ever thought about this when you got into a store and seen a camera tracking your movements while you're in that store, including your face without your consent? Now, this likely in almost all cases, is harmless, but the technology now exists that can harvest those video feeds and run them against photo databases and social media posts'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And now, in our Zoom culture, we have yet another avenue for our spaces to be captured digitally. But where does it stop? And it can be taken place in so many different modes. Well, not an example of facial recognition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One thing that I have really hated that involves technology and tracking has been when I've been continually exposed to ads interrupting my trying to read a news article online. But what really bothered me a couple of years ago was when I found out that these ads are tailored for me based on my preferences being tracked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you are reading the same article online, you're going to be interrupted by ads, but they'll be different ads based on a new contract and your priorities. So where does all of this lead? What happens when the technology screws up, which it does.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this identifies an individual, particularly when there can be dire consequences and effects for that person. And we've heard how racial bias is so prevalent within this technology. And 2018 study, and I think Nick referred to this, showed that darker skinned females were the most misclassified group with the error rates of up to almost 35% compared to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the maximum error rate found of 0.8% for lighter skinned males. And multiple studies have demonstrated that it's up to 100 times more likely to identify black or Asian faces compared with white faces. And black women in particular, they are misidentified at significantly higher rates than other demographics, and the technology is even less reliable, according to research that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'been done when identifying transgender individuals and entirely inaccurate when used on non-binary people. Now you've heard the harrowing stories about a lot of people. One is Robert Julian BAUCHER Williams, who went to jail for 30 hours after the Detroit police arrested him in front of his wife and children.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think about Nigella Parkes was jailed in New Jersey for ten days and spent over $5,000 in legal fees to defend himself. Michael Oliver lost his job and car while being held in a Detroit jail for three days on a felony larceny charge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, these three black men were wrongfully arrested due to false facial recognition matches for crimes they did not commit. Robert Julian boy, Chuck Williams is now suing the city of. For damages. So for me, government agencies should not be allowed to display known racist, anti-black facial recognition technology in communities that are already, I believe, over surveilled and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'overpoliced. Now, we could argue that facial recognition can be beneficial, and it probably can be, but we have to really find the right balance here. And I think the evidence shows that it remains unclear whether facial recognition technology has contributed to the arrest or prosecution of riot participants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even at the January six capitol, insurgents. We just know that there are a lot of issues that are continuing here where there are mistakes made many times grievous, many times life threatening or even deadly. So I think we just need to take this situation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have in place a ban on this, and we can always remove that ban through future legislation if we know at that time that privacy concerns the incorrect charges that can be made. And civil rights, civil liberties concerns are fully addressed and there's no reason anymore.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm sorry. I'm just too concerned about all that can go wrong with what we have now. And that's why I've offered this legislation. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome. Thank you, colleagues, for the questions conversation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I for some reason I thought this was on for discussion purposes. Are we planning on voting on it right now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Checkpoint This is this is the first time it's been on our agenda. My intent would be to have a discussion today and probably take action at our next meeting. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to make sure people have an opportunity to raise issues, concerns, support, thoughts. In this discussion, Lala Kent remembers a whole lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Nick, thank you earlier for distinguishing the legislation from the state and city level legislation. The explanations felt a little bit itemized to me. Is there a way for you to kind of give a more high level couple sentence difference between what the state is doing and what the county is doing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, for example, ours is more restrictive than the states are. Ours has different requirements that just along those lines, because in my head, I have one list of what this one does and another list of what the other one does without really kind of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Summarizing it all. Absolutely. Council members. So in the highest possible level, the state law and the city of Seattle's ordinance allowed for the potential use of R. Should the local approval that they provide. Both of them provide transparency and public notice that this technology may be used by a city, a city or State Department or local agency'",
        "'speaker_2': ', whereas the counties is far more restrictive. And just in just saying that, you may not use this technology. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lambert Council member LAMBERT Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a couple of quick questions. Earlier, you talked about sketched images not being included. Could you explain to me what that means.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that as as mentioned in the earlier background, the technologies are more accurate when you have a standardized straight a picture. And so the state law prohibits any law enforcement agency from using SRT that uses the basis of deface attempt to match from a sketch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So essentially that you must have an actual photo of the person you're attempting to identify.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So, you know, if you're a victim of a crime and you go in and they make a photo montage, kind of for you to say that that's what it looks like, you know, and then they could run it through our teeth to be able to see, you know, which people might be likely to look like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to narrow it down. We wouldn't be able to do that because the whole thing is banned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Under the state law. You would not be able to a law enforcement agency would not be able to do that once it goes into effect on July 1st of this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I agree with Council member Cole Wells on the idea that I'm very concerned about how much data is out there. I too have gotten specialized ads on a product about six months ago that you only buy like once a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I have been deluged with that same thing and it's driving me crazy. So is there any date by which the state law or any other some of this data says you must delete all this data within five years or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there any final date of of that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some cities have taken the approach of banning or restricting the use of private enterprises and using FRC. But the Washington state law and this county ordinance does not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And my last question is this. Where in the in the Bill Digest today does it show the information on the state? I didn't see where that was all written out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I did not include as there are quite a difference in as I mentioned earlier on, what was I did not include a background on the state law, but I'm happy to provide you a summary if you would like that online.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I think following a councilmember there, my Zala, I would like to see a side by side of the two. And then in the report on page 18 of this, it talks about data up to 2010. So I'm wondering from 2010 to 2021 what the data changes were.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you could get that or at least tell me why we're using over a decade old tech data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that that that refers to. While the facial recognition technology has been around since the 1960s, it only became prevalent in 2010 when computers became powerful enough to manage the massive galleries that the systems required to do this sort of machine learning to make the technology work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So none of the data is matched on that. The data that you gave us about the 34% and the point 2%, that was all the data based on data from 2021.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's based on from a 2018. Nice study.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And there's nothing more recent than that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do not. Not that I have reviewed in this research now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my my concern that I'd like to see in our next briefing is. What will this do if we decide to be different from the state and the state wants to collect data as being the largest state county?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What will that do to being able to really collect good data? Because I think, as Councilmember Crowell says, we really need to know more about all of this data, not just facial recognition, but lots of data collected on us and our analytics and our buying habits and how we can protect ourselves and our constituents from lots of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'information floating around forever. So if you could talk a little bit about that, what the comparisons will be, what impact as being different from the state will have. I'll be wonderful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to make sure that we're not leaving anybody with the impression that this software, a ban on facial recognition technology, would address tailored ads to individuals that I believe was used as an example of deep reach, perhaps overreach by technology, of analyzing the individual person's activities, as some would compare this software to doing as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this banning facial recognition technology would not affect the current use of ads in social media streams. And so I want to make be clear about that. And the audience before us, if I'm not mistaken, would only affect King County government entities, not any private use or other entities within the counties boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also clarify, if I can, Mr. Bowman, that the state legislation putting some strong sideboards and recognitions of civil liberty and other concerns when it goes into effect the first in July is applies to King County government entities, the very entities that this legislation would affect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. So both of those states and this ordinance only deal with government entities. There is nothing related to private companies and how they use facial recognition technology or tracking across advertising and marketing. And there there really is just sideboards primarily related to law enforcement coming down from the state law and also transparency and review from state law'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to local governments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which is certainly a avenue and quarter that as Councilmember Caldwell's introduction documents have is concerning in our community when we have the power of law enforcement to our image, our obligation to make sure that we're using it justly and well in it and not in equitably.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I certainly recognize the wanting to make sure that the technology, if it were to be used, is used well and not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In error.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Would you just check? Does the state law require, as part of the work an agency needs to make public before using SRT? They must define what the retention period is and the date of the recent process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I believe that that is in the state law. So if you could check and make sure that we have that accurate, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry, sir. Could you repeat that one more time? Are you saying so? How long in the accountability records the agency must define how long they intend to retain that data? Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If they intend to use that type of technology, they must include in the accountability report how long they intend to hold on to that that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excellent. Thank you for the clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further questions. Conversation Council member Belge. You're on mute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was somebody. Thank you. I was listening carefully to Councilmember Caldwell's remarks in support of the legislation, and it's a very compelling case and the public testimony. It's a very compelling case. When you have technology that is has been shown to have these kinds of impacts and then the risk of rolling it out in ways that could'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cause harm to our constituents and that that cannot be undone. And so I think it's a very compelling case. I want to ask if the sponsor would would take a question. Yes. What I if you could just explain, because this issue of sort of the state went through a process to come up with a piece of legislation'",
        "'speaker_1': '. There was a great deal of work that went into that, as my understanding in your thinking. What is the what is the the justification for us? Like, why is the state law not sufficient to meet the need that you have so compellingly identified?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much for the question. For me, it really comes down to protection of civil liberties. And I think there's just too much evidence currently that the potential for harm to individuals is so strong that it would be preferable to ban the use of this technology.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've looked at a lot of the at least research summaries, some coming from M.I.T., computer science researchers, employees of technology companies, and then some are comments, scholars and even corporate stakeholders that facial recognition use by governments. We're not talking about private entities here, just has too much potential harm that I don't want it to be used by'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our government. Now, I said earlier that maybe in the future it could be refined so much that we could we could amend action here. But I also think that there is a potential for making the problem worse if the facial recognition systems were to become totally accurate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much surveillance power by a government do we need? Do we really need to track people by their race? Do we need really to profile and monitor people based on really secret algorithms? And do we really need to create databases that can be exploited by ICE in our immigration systems and other government agencies?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm very concerned about the direction that we're going in, and I believe that we, as the current government have a we should have a policy to lead with racial equity as the driving force for how we develop laws and priorities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what we're about. But this is an ordinance that I think really would put equity into action. The technology is out there that is just too potentially dangerous, I believe. And it is our most vulnerable and already marginalized populations that are suffering disproportionality from its application.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now. So I feel very strongly about this. And I, I think it's very appropriate for our county to take this step and impose the ban. If something changes, we can undo that. But I'm concerned with all that's the momentum that's going forward and it seems to be so quickly going forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much do our citizens want to be tracked by government? And. Especially when there's such a high mistake rate for darker skinned people, especially darker skinned women. And. Thank you. Thank you for answering that question, Councilman, because I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm also moved by the fact that we're watching kind of it in real time, a terrifying experiment and the the hyper hyper surveillance of an entire population of people in another part of the world. And I'm not going to get into that right here, but I think sort of placing guardrails around the technology here makes it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'less likely that we will end up in that kind of an extreme situation, like when you see persecution in other parts of the world. So I thank you for that explanation. It's helpful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further discussion. Thank you so much. Colleagues will look forward to taking on this legislation and our end of items on our agenda today. Madam Clerk, did anybody miss any votes today?'"
