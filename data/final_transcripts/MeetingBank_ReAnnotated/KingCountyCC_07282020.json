    "Juneteenth as a Paid Holiday for King County Employees.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'We've got some other interesting issues before the committee. Item number seven is proposed ordinance 2020, dash 0224, which would make June 19th or Juneteenth, an annual holiday for King County employees. Juneteenth has historically been celebrated by the African-American community as the date of the end of slavery in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mike Reed from council staff will give a staff report and executive staff are here as well to answer any questions. It's the first time we've had a chance to look at it. Today is the first day I heard about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll look forward to maybe a first pass on this and what folks have to say. Mike, go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And you, this is a proposed ordinance 2020 0224. So you're aware, as you indicated, Mr. Chair, that the enslavement for African-Americans continued through the period of the American Civil War, which was 1861 to 1865'",
        "'speaker_0': ', towards the end of that, that war on June 19th of 1865, General Gordon Granger in the company of 2000 federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas. And I should say by way of context that Texas was out of the primary theater of war, and so became a place where those who were interested in retaining their enslaved persons retreated'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to and as the war came to an end. So General Granger read to the community general order number three, and I won't read the whole order, but the key piece is as follows The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the United States, all slaves are free.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The celebrations which ensued are following at that reading are continued on the anniversary of that June 19th date for the coming decades in Texas and extended to African American communities throughout the nation over the coming coming years. However, formal recognition of that date did not occur on the part of public bodies that is, the county, county and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'state and federal governments for over 100 years, until the years somewhat after the civil rights movement of the 1960s. So in particular, over the last 20 years, state governments have in state codes provided formal recognition, but not legal paid holiday status to a June 19th as Juneteenth acknowledging the end of slavery in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In at the county level in King County there are ten named holidays in King County code and there are two personal holidays. There is no reference, however, to to Juneteenth as a named or paid holiday. The ordinance before you this afternoon would provide for the extension of the paid holiday status to June, June 19th and designated as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Juneteenth. So a proposed ordinance, a 2020 dash or 2 to 4, would provide that extension. It's also noted that the labor agreements are or represented. Employees that are in place in King County do require that modification of language relating to to extension of paid holidays is a bargain item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the legislation does does also provide that the executive may enter into or extend existing agreements with labor organizations to extend to representative employees. Those are those that paid holiday status, which by the legislation is extended to the number of employees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Office of Labor Relations has historically provided cost estimates for these kinds of these kinds of extensions. And in this case, so what they were asked to do that the there is an attachment to your staff report which summarizes this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in some they've estimated that $4.8 million would be the cost to extend the the paid holiday status to county employees for the Juneteenth holiday that is primarily for or the cost of overtime. So there will be some services that are likely to continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, transit services, wastewater services, service, and that's what we continue over the course of the holiday. And overtime would be to be paid for those employees with providing those services and again, at a cost of about $4.8 million.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's also a productivity loss that would be expected for those services, which would not continue. And the equivalent cost is estimated at six. $3 Million in Productivity Lost To or without those services. Legal review has been completed on this legislation and no amendment was recommended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Matt McCoy did provide for the Office of Labor Relations of the Cost Estimate and he is here to offer to respond to questions. Richard Hayes, also from the Human Resources Department, is here to respond to questions as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Chair. Like, thanks for that very fine staff report. I know this is Councilmember Debusk is legislation, I believe. Right? Right. Yes, sir. Okay. And in in Matt. Rick, at this point, I know him in to let you speak next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just wanted to see if there was any any any additional comments that either one of you would like to make at this time or if you wanted to wait for questions? No, sir. Okay. One quick comment. The analysis analysis that I did, I regard kind of a high level analysis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We haven't done a deep dove. And so the figures presented are more of a general magnitude of the costs rather than what we a more of a pinpoint estimate. So the four and a half million in the 6.2 million, roughly 10 million, that assumes a paid time off holiday, not just an addition type of holiday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And let's be clear, those are separate estimates. There's a couple different ways to examine this issue. One way to say, oh, how much productivity are we losing if we give everyone the day off? And that's where the $6 million estimate comes from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other thing I think maybe that I kind of lip do is how much more how much extra money is this going to cost the county if we provide this holiday? And that's in the form of overtime costs that people like wastewater or the correctional facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we'll be paying them overtime almost certainly because of the labor contracts, and that's where the $4.8 billion figure is coming from. So there's separate it's not 10 million. It's somewhere in the range, I would say between four and 6 million.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Understood. Okay. Ron, why don't you want you to kind of orient as to what you're thinking on this and then give us a sense of kind of what you wanted to do. Thank you, Mr.. Appreciate it. What I'd like to do is move adoption with a do pass recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have some time between now and full council consideration because of the recess and that I'd like to. Give some background and thinking and have some dialog. Okay. Well, that's. She wanted to watch you make the motion, and then we can decide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do move on to move adoption with a yeah. Doing ascertainment. Go ahead. Go ahead broad. And then she can have a point of order because you sure. Go ahead. Mr.. Move adoption with the do pass recommendation. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Kathy, you had a comment on a point of order.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought this was on for briefing. I didn't think it was on for briefing the action because this is the first time we've seen it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. It's up for discussion and possible action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't see. I mean, look back again. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. How is that listed there, Councilmember Lambert? On the agenda. I thought it was up with possible action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I had not thought of that as an action today. It is an action.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, I've described the events with respect to the civil rights movement in the last couple of months in this country is a great awakening. And I and I believe that that is the case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I also think that there's another phrase that might be a great reconciliation that should occur. I think like many of you, I am a strong believer in the principle and value in our country of freedom as a bedrock and foundational principle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we celebrate that as a country on July 4th, Independence Day. But I don't believe, Mr. Chair, that our nation has fully reconciled itself to the underpinnings of where we are today as a country with respect to the enslavement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of Africans in our country. And that is what I believe, that this holiday, if we were to declare it an official holiday, is about. It's about freedom for folks that really help build this country, help build the capital, help build the White House, help build the Washington Monument.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But did so not by choice, but by their condition as. Slaves, enslaved people and in servitude. Mr. Reed, who I want to say has been an incredible. 12th floor staffer. With respect in particular to equity and social justice issues talked about in the staff report the basics of this and that is following.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'September 22nd, 1862. The Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln. In those days, maybe the word didn't spread as far and as wide and as deep as folks today would have it. And not until June of 1865 did. Word of the Emancipation Proclamation reached Texas when general order number three was read by the Union Army.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your Galveston and Mr. Reed quoted the relevant part there, and that is that all enslaved people or slaves were free, and that it went on to say later their relationship was that of employer and employee. Now, I didn't know when I came onto the council, Mr. Chair, about Juneteenth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're out here in the West. It's not quite as rooted in our culture, but I learned about it over seven years with our colleague, then colleague, Councilmember Gossett, who each of you will recall brought forth at this time in June of each year, a special proclamation where he invited community leaders in from the African-American community here in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'King County to tell us about Juneteenth and educate us a little bit. And I need to confess to you all that even then I didn't really understand the importance of this moment in history and this this holiday to the people that helped build our country until the spring and the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Largest civil rights movement in the history of America. Maybe even the world goes has come forward and this has been a key part of it. A number of states, 47 of them recognized in some way Juneteenth as a holiday in Texas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, for state government employees, that is actually an official holiday, which is what this legislation would do. A paid official holiday. And the movement is growing to to make it so nationwide. I think in a county name now in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That this declaration and this move, this legislation, which would make Juneteenth an official paid holiday, is the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do. And you cannot, Mr. Chair, in my view, put a price on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You cannot put a price on freedom. And that's what Juneteenth is about. It's about recognizing and celebrating liberation, independence and freedom for folks. And in our country, African-American folks, black folks that have not had historically that independence and freedom.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it is worth lifting up and cementing in the culture of our county and providing an opportunity to celebrate it. To advance its cause. And to remember from where we came and the opportunities of where we are and promises are where we can go with a day that's off, that's paid to take the time to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'do that. So I, I commend this to my colleagues. I thank council members Charlie and Co Wells, I think are the current co-sponsors of it. I think we can afford it on a on a $4.8 million cost out of 6 million annually or so in our budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And frankly, I don't think we can afford not to do it. And I respectfully request that we advance it forward today and lead. And I hope that our state will adopt it statewide and that other jurisdictions around the country will follow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks up during Mr. Chair to share some remarks on why I think this is appropriate legislation. Thank you, Councilmember Nevsky. Appreciate those thoughtful words and the words of a mr. Reid staff. It's because it's hitting us quickly. I want to make sure, though, that everyone has a chance to ask the questions to discuss this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You've asked for a do pass recommendation and you've asked for that today. So I think that we should get anyone who ask questions or comments. Let's get them out. I have a couple of myself sitting in front somewhat flat footed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does anyone have any questions? Grove okay, up to go, followed by Lambert. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I appreciate my colleagues comments. You can't put a price on freedom, but you can't put a price on a holiday. And so what is the fiscal impact and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If any. I might quickly note that again, there's been reference to the $4.8 million. So it's about the expectation is that there would be a number of services that would need to continue. Are those, as you heard referenced earlier, would be things like transit, wastewater, sheriffs, sheriff services right above the services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those those employees would be paid added overtime rate. The cost of those services is estimated at $4.8 million. A follow up, if I may, Mr. Chair. I wonder if there's any creative way to provide recognition to the holiday without resulting in having to cut deeper into the services and programs often that benefit the people we're recognizing'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I'm loath to vote against Juneteenth as a holiday and likely to be supportive. I just there's there's a tradeoff there that's an I don't know if there are other ways to structure vacations or annual recognitions or in ways that don't create an overtime cost or I don't know if you explored that at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As sponsor. If there were, you know, again, I'm likely to support it. I just wonder if there's other ways to achieve the same outcomes without having that fiscal hit at a time when, unfortunately, we know we're digging. So it just means digging a little bit more and having an impact in other programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so finding that balance, if there's any other creative ways that we do holidays that don't drive a fiscal cost, because I was surprised to see the kids grow up to grow. I guess that's a question to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First, I acknowledge the cost. It's 4.8 million estimated in overtime to keep costs or keep services going. And the way I looked at it was to say, well, we we pay folks to celebrate President George Washington's birthday. We pay folks to celebrate Veterans Day, Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, and the day after Thanksgiving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We pay folks to celebrate New Year's Day. And we have an MLK holiday, which is about Martin Luther King Jr. I looked at that list and I thought, frankly. That the recognition of the liberation of African-Americans in America warranted the same or better treatment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's where I came down. There's there's I didn't want to give it second tier status. I didn't want to treat it as an honorable mention, if you will. I just I just I just thought, you know, it's worth writing the check for, and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You bet it does. Costs some money. And your your recognition of that is real. But that's where I came down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So wg.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Chair. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I have a request for my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I heard a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Couple of factual questions and policy answers, and it may be that that's where we're at, that that we have all the factual answers to questions. And the answer is to choose to do it or not to do it, given those questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I want to make a plea, and I will make this plea on any issue, not just this issue. Since we're having committee meetings and we've been having more committee meetings, I really want to ask that we not forward things that haven't been fully briefed, debated before getting voted on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to do amendments in committee and committee work in committee. We have all lived through how challenging it is when we get only every other week and we are looking at whether we need to do more council meetings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But at this point it's every other week. It would be great if we could allow folks to have one more meeting with this, to ask their questions, get their answers, and then take a vote here at committee with everybody feeling fully informed before sending it to council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I just really want to minimize the amount of committee debate and amendments and things that happen in council. Or as you see, last week we had 8 hours of council meeting. That's more than two meetings worth and it's been like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So not commenting on the substance of this proposal, but I've heard that there are questions in answer to councilmember up the gross question about whether there are ways that we can rethink how we do holidays. Perhaps that maybe minimizes the overall cost without signaling anyone out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By the way, I was not on the Council when we voted to recognize Thanksgiving as a holiday a little bit before my time. And so I might have had the similar questions back then, but I just really want to ask if we would be willing to make sure that everybody has an opportunity with this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is the first bite of this apple here at the meeting. I would really prefer that we make sure that we get all the work done in committee, and then I'd be very happy to vote it out and vote in full council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But just procedurally, I'm going to be asking that for pretty much everything at every committee. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Thanks for the request. I agree with your position, Councilmember Baldacci, but I also have a request from our members. So I think it's up to the member what he wants to do in terms of moving this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think he should probably respond to you and then I have some comments or questions about specific legislation. This is your next cast as soon as we hear from Rod. If he wants to talk. Okay. Kathy, you want to go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Eat? I was feeling the same way as how can we do this? And when I was looking at this the other day, looking at the ten holidays to personal holidays, one of the thoughts I had was, what if we asked our employees if one of the two personal holidays could be dedicated to this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also in the timing of where this fits in the year is about the time that people would like to have a holiday. So I thought, let's look at maybe using one of the personal favorites, dedicating that out because it is important to all of us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was lucky enough to go to a Juneteenth party with Larry, and I learned a lot at the party, and we had a wonderful time with the celebration. So anyway, that was one idea that we had. And the idea that we had is to look at maybe doing three segments in the county so that each year employees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to choose what schedule they want to work on. And if we are going to work on this weekend, what we came up with the three different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Schedules.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that people could decide which of the three holiday types they want to be on so that we don't have to pay overtime, that we have a variety of when people are going to work and not work because certain holidays say maybe people are families, not around at Thanksgiving, but they'd rather do it at a different time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of year. They could sign up for that. If you look at the ten days we have for holidays right now, the two personal holidays and 21 vacation days after five years, that's 33 days of the year, which is a month and a quarter off for every employee over five years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is a lot. And so I think we need to look at that overall. We're going to open the door if we need to clean out what's going on and make sure that we are in line with the people who are paying the salaries, but maybe not getting a month and a quarter up every year after they've'",
        "'speaker_1': 'worked five years. So I think that there's work that needs to be done. I'm happy to help work on this work because I do think it's important and may meet other needs with moms that have daycare issues that some of this might be helpful for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think we have lots of work that we can do. And I agree that this opens up a door that maybe we need to be looking at more globally anyway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, kasey, for those comments. Other comments from my colleagues. Okay. Let me just say that. Here's here's that here's some of the issues I have. There's a couple different. I always wondered, how do these holidays get created?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like, how do they come up with Presidents Day or Columbus Day? Nobody likes Columbus Day. They just throw a statute in the water. We don't recognize Columbus Day here. Is that correct? That's my first question. We do not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The federal government does. We don't because I'd be willing to swap that baby out right now. But that isn't an option. So we have holidays that we recognize as special days, but people still come to work. Then we have holidays that we recognize as time off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a substantial cost, increased cost for ones that are time off. Not only do you have to, you know, you're paying employees, you're also getting a reduction in productivity because those employees are working one less work day a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You also have the side effect that the constituency that we serve isn't getting the services presumably for that day, particularly places like deeper encounter operations that we have. And so. That middle that middle ground recognizing is is a special day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do that in a minute's clearly rise as well beyond the level of special recognition. The issue for me is how do we how do we pay for it? Have we done the proper analysis? At some point you can't just keep adding holidays.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think Canada has a holiday every month. At some point you start to actually see meaningful reduction in the productivity to go to see. So that's that is a concern to me and the costs associated with it are concern to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I really want to do a deeper dove if I'm comfortable voting for this. On what those costs are loss of productivity. I know we have a rough estimate. I heard 4.9. I heard 6.5. What services are going to be impacted and how we're going to get around those issues before I'm ready to support it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe the majority of counsel wants to support it today. I want to flag I'm not going to speak to this anymore. I'm just going to flag this. We are in very serious Financial Times right now. The likes of which we haven't seen for generations in America.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Neither has the county. And we just gave an $80 million raise to the bus drivers. We're now talking about giving ourselves a free holiday at King County. That's going to cost a lot of money to the taxpayers. I think there's value.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's value in thinking through this just a little bit more with a little more process. So the proper amendments can be made to guard and protect all of the interests that have been articulated here. However. I'm not going to get in the way of democratic process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those are my own views. I sure like to take a chance to look at this more, do some other amendment work here. Give the Chair McDermott a chance to speak and vote in favor of assuming of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But. But we'll go wherever the maker of the motion, Mr. Ambassador, wants to go. From here. Rod, what would you like to do based on the comments you've heard? Well. I have a lot of a lot of thoughts, Mr. Chair, but we're short on time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I introduced legislation on June 19, 40 days ago, so I don't know that it should be a surprise to anybody. But in consideration of colleagues interest in having opportunity to reflect and learn more, although I think it's quite simple.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Costs are here. I do need to say I'm not swayed by the cost argument at all. This is about humanity and respecting the dignity of a portion of our population in this country that has frankly been put. Behind and put second and put last for 400 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that that does not sway me one bit. But in consideration of members interest. To learn more, I would change my motion or amend it to advance it with or without recommendation. So there are there is time for members to get the questions answered that they want if they want to develop amendments, they can, but that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'keep moving forward, that we bring this forward and and get it and get it considered by the full council. So that would be my suggested approach, Mr. Chair, to try and acknowledge some of the concerns by folks today to to but at the same time honor the spirit of the moment and the co-sponsors who have decided that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this is a good thing to do. So that would be a suggestion. Okay. Okay. So it sounds like you're comfortable moving it forward without recommendation, which to the viewing audience just means that the council's procedurally moving forward haven't really weighed in on the substance of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's kind of our tradition, right, when we want to keep things moving but have our way and then on the merits. Okay. All right. So that's before us. What do you think of that? I think it's a good place to start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think maybe. Is there any other discussion on this if we're going to move it out with a recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah? Before you go, Jeannie. Claudia. Claudia. I'm going to hand the gavel magically through the world of whatever this is to you. Because I have to get in the car to drive to my child's 11th birthday party. And I will not miss that for the world, but I will reappear with a different backdrop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So now you have the gavel. Jeannie, you go right now. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Madam Chair. So I am one of the sponsors of this legislation, and I do so very positively and enthusiastically and look forward to the counsels as soon as whether or not we vote on it without recommendation today or we wait for to, I guess, three weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Three or four weeks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Given the recess coming up. That's right. Because the holiday is not until next June. I would just like to do this right where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everybody.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will feel good about it. I would like to say, though, that I think this is a really critical measure, not only given the backdrop. Of what our society is going through now. The pandemic with addressing racial justice. But I also look at this from the point of view of someone who's been involved in an effort for a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'very long time. I cannot help but think of a film I used to show a long time ago when I was teaching at Cal State Long Beach sociology and teaching at the University of Washington for a long time in sociology.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The film was called Black. Lost or stolen or stream and it is available. I just checked. I googled it. It's really outstanding. And it was actually released in 1968. And the premise, which is rather obvious by the title, is that we, so many of us do not know about black history and all the contributions that have been'",
        "'speaker_1': 'made and the significance of black participation in our development of our society and also throughout the whole time of this country since its inception. And I remember one girl growing up, I knew nothing about this. I knew about slavery.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But our textbooks in our schools did not portray anything realistically, significantly about the contributions of black Americans in our society throughout all fields of study and all fields in our lives. So I think this is really important and it is a way for our county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'King County, Martin Luther King County chairman to be able to say, hey, this is important. It's not only are solely rather about freedom, which is what our country supposedly was founded upon, but it's about what is reflected in our society today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's about time that Americans of all stripes, all colors, know about the important contributions and significance of black Americans and and others and our way of life and what we've accomplished as a society. And so I feel very strongly about this, and I think we should pass it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, I'm fine with doing it today. With that recommendation, though, that would lead to amendments to the council meeting, which I know the chair is not in favor or we wait until we come back. There's time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember others. I'll just say a few words before we move to a vote. I, i, i share the view of those who think this is an important measure and something that we very much ought to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, in addition to all the things that have been said, which I won't repeat, I also feel that it is an important opportunity each year for us to reflect upon our progress in moving from where we are with regard to racial freedom, equity, justice, opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The words of the proclamation itself are something that I think automatically upon reading them, they cause me any way to reflect on how far we have come, but also how far we have yet to go. And so I think for that purpose, it is a really valuable holiday to add to our list of holidays, because it marks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a time each year when we should we should be reminded to reflect upon and recommit to, to justice. And so I think it's a good idea, and I think we should find a way to do it. My request really isn't met by making it move without recommendation if it's going to move.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would just as soon move it with recommendation because I think that's a stronger statement. My request is if there's still work to be done, that that work be done in committee. I'm really sincerely asking my colleagues to not send things to council that are not fully baked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hear and am mindful of the length of time that some things have been waiting since introduction and have not had committee time. I think that as we continue to have more access to committee slots like you saw a couple of weeks ago, we're able to move more things forward and and therefore, probably naturally things will move'",
        "'speaker_1': 'forward faster and not sit in, you know, limbo, unheard. But I'm sincere and serious in that request. I really think that we are going to do better as a body if we do our committee work in committee. And I know as somebody who supports this and is prepared to move towards doing it, that some of us may'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be ready to vote and go. But some of us have expressed that we are not that we have some questions that we want to look at. And and so I just renew that ask. But if that ask is declined, then we will have a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council member and basket. Want to call on your close?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. Then I withdraw my floated possible amendment to move it forward with our recommendation and renew my motion to move forward with recommendation. This is simple legislation. It adds an official paid holiday in the county code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To recognize Juneteenth as a paid official holiday. The brief. It was introduced on June 19th. Five weeks ago. There's been plenty of time to review it. It's simple. We have the cost estimates. That seems to be the major concern and we have the answer to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I believe members today can decide whether or not it's worth it, whether it's nice to worth it, whether or not it's worth it to recognize African-Americans in this country. On the day that they were finally announced as fully free following Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, some tune it half years before on September 22nd, 1862, when in Texas'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The American Army came to Galveston and read general order number three. And I think it's the right thing to do. I felt very strongly about it as an individual council member, that is my obligation. To use the position and power that has been entrusted to me in the franchise that has been granted to me to bring forward'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this legislation and to move it now in. Folks can vote how they would like, but these reflect my values and I'm proud to recommend you to the full council. I think more needs to be done. I request my colleagues vote yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the extent that statement suggested that members who have questions about what this means and how to implement it are not supportive of racial equity and justice. I think that's unfortunate and I'm sorry if that's the case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't say that at all, ma'am. I spoke from my standard that my strong and my strong feelings and what I heard from the debate today in terms of questions about cost and and I believe it's fairly straightforward legislation, and I think we should move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to state as the chair, that to the extent that there was an inference that those who might think that there's more work to be done don't agree as a policy matter. That is that's unfortunate and really shouldn't be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was no.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Lambert. Thank you, Madam Chair. I, too, am a little shocked. Whether it was my interpretation or not. I too interpreted the final comments to be. To be very sad. I do have questions about all of the holidays, which is why we did some work in my office on just how many holidays should there be total.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have no problems with this being the holiday. I actually think the better idea. But I also think that we need to be looking at the taxpayers are paying for all these holidays in general, not just this one, but all of them.'"

    "Implementation Plan for Puget Sound Taxpayer Accountability Account Proceeds.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Member I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we really have voted and it's time to move on. There will be another opportunity. A full council. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Moving on to item eight. This is discussion and possible action regarding the positive implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have Patrick Hamacher and Erin Aria from council staff to give a staff report. I should probably say for purposes of the public who don't understand what we're talking about when we suddenly turn to the master implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's an acronym. It stands for the Puget Sound Taxpayer Accountability Account. That would hardly you would hardly be the blamed if that didn't tell you much more. This is a it is a funding source that is going to be passed through to King County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The money comes from essentially sales tax, like payment from sound transit as they build their construction of stage three, the third sound transit capital program. And it is intended for educational purposes. So we're going to have a staff report today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand we also have executive staff here to answer questions. We've heard a lot of really good public comment in support of this. But based on what I understand as the second backup chair here today, the chair wasn't intending to move this out today, but that put it on the agenda again for action on August 25th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with that understanding of the plan, I'm going to call on Patrick Hamacher first to begin the presentation. Please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. For the record, Patrick Hamacher, and you did an excellent job of covering much of what I was going to cover. And with respect to the time I think we are on. Just to orient you, we're on page 149 and going to 100, page 150 and your staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The only part I will add to the background section is that the reason we're here today is that last November you passed an ordinance, while last August and last November you passed legislation that together required an implementation plan for the use of pastor funds to be transmitted to the Council for your approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was also a request for funding and for staffing to begin rolling out the pastor funds, and that has been rolled into an omnibus that was taken up by Councilmember Kowalski's Budget Committee. And so what's before you today is the implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Aaron is going to begin the discussion of the elements that were required to be in the plan and how well the transmitted plan comports with those. So that concludes my remarks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Aaron I had staff. The analysis section of the staff report begins on page 151 of your packet. You'll notice in the section a series of tables designed to compare the direction given by Council in motion 15492 with the various elements of the implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At a high level, the plan identifies four main cost centers visualized in table two on page 153 of your packet administration and evaluation accounts for 7% of the total over the life of the account, with 10% each year available for technical assistance and capacity building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'After accounting for that expense, the remainder is divided by only 52% for early learning facilities, 38% for King County Promise, and 10% for community based organizations. Table three on page one, 53 of the packet outlines the motion criteria for governance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The plan recommends the establishment of a CAIB as a subcommittee to serve as the advisory group to the UAB, which is the King County Children and Youth Advisory Board. It appears that the governance section includes the elements required by the motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The financial plan previously covered the introduction, and the financial plan is basically what you would expect using transit during projections from April of this year. So I will not get into that more at this time unless you would like me to, and I will keep going for time sake.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Those requirements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Were largely met and then areas of note will be discussed in the next section of funding. Category one and early learning facilities are E.L.F. Begins on page 156 of your packet. The recommendations of this category were derived from the work of the E.L.F.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Work Group. The membership is listed in attachment three on page 2 to 67 packet. But again, we're on page 156 right now. The left hand column of table six remains the direction to the executive branch outlined in motion 15492.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the sake of time, I'll only highlight areas of discrepancy. The motion directs the executive branch to set appropriate target enrollment figures based on income level, local cost of living and payment makes and strategies to sustainably maximize services to prioritize populations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Prioritized populations are defined in section eight of motion 15492 on page 244 of your packet. The plan notes that this work was postponed due to the impact of COVID 19 on the childcare industry, and DCH has plans to explore enrollment targets once industry has been able to recover.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The motion directs the creation of strategies to ensure facilities are built with project labor agreements or other labor friendly practices. TCHC contracts will require activities financed by passive pasta proceeds to comply with applicable prevailing wage requirements and labor agreements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the county may consider implementing a project labor agreement if deemed applicable. Additionally, the motion stipulates that grants for family daycare providers will not exceed $20,000 per facility. However, the plan raises the maximum grant for this category from $20000 to $75000 per award, and that's in order to sufficiently meet the needs of the facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The ALF work group recommended this change and it aligns with the State Department of Commerce Technical Assistance Plan that they commissioned in 2019. Moving to funding Category two. Unless there are questions on that section, I'm going to keep rolling.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is stopping if you would like to. Madam Chair, funding category to me, does it say to my colleagues, I am very happy to let Erin finish the entire presentation, but if you do have a question at any point that it would be best asked in a moment, please just speak out and we'll call on you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. Please go ahead, Erin. Thank you. Funding Category two King County Promise begins on page 158 of your packet. The recommendations of this category were derived from the work of the Promise Work Group. The membership for that work group is listed on attachment and attachment for on page 269 of your packet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'While funding for this category aligns with the structure set forth in motion 15492 with the King County Promise Fund split with 45% for K through 12, 45% for post-secondary and 10% for community based organizations. The plan provides for two programs to be created.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the first is called Promise Partnerships, where K through 12 districts, community and technical colleges and community based organizations will be asked to co-design the strategy and submit a proposal for funding through a competitive RFP process administered by King County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Through the Partnership through the Promise Partnerships, TCHC seeks to create a fund, a cohesive pipeline of services for the grantees, and to partner and collaborate with other organizations so that each application includes at least two of the following one or more public community or technical college, one or more public K-through-12 district and or one or more youth'",
        "'speaker_1': 'serving community based organization. The second sort of funding program that is envisioned is a system supporting organization which the plan envisions would focus on ensuring a functional pipeline. Excuse me, a functional pipeline is created for student support in order to achieve the target outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'According to the plan, the systems supporting organization will provide direct services to the Promised Partnership Funding recipients, including working to develop a system building effort that fosters collaboration among the funding partners. Table eight looks at the King County or the K through 12 promised dedication and can be found on page 158 of your packet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This section is largely consistent with the motion. However, the motion directs that investments be made in career and advising, including through trade and apprenticeship programs. The plan represents that these these as potential commitments that could be agreed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Noting that the first group of promised partnerships will collaborate and design a set of shared commitments and working to achieve the outcome targets set forth in the motion. Table nine reviews the post-secondary promise dedication beginning on page 160.'",

Student supports and reduction in barriers and completing a post-secondary degree or credential according to the plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Children, Youth and Young Adult Division staff will bring funded entities together to co-develop a set of commitments that may include the items just mentioned. And funding category three begins on page 161 of your packet. You'll know the left hand column of 211 outline instructions given then the motion for the remainder and the remaining 10% dedicated to community'",
        "'speaker_1': 'based organizations. Our analysis showed that the plan largely met that direction, differing in terms of procurement and the time planned for the recommendations for this funding category were developed by the Racial Equity Coalition, known as the RTC, which served as the work group for this funding category.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The 15 member organization is provided an Attachment five on page 21, which is also the last page of your packet break immediately. And then the plan envisions a three year pilot called Love and Liberation, or L.A. for Short, where RTC organizations would perform direct work with youth, including out-of-school time or expanded learning opportunities, access to physical education'",
        "'speaker_1': ', mentoring and case management. According to executive staff, these positive funds would allow for new and new, but existing L.A. services through the United Way King County, to be scaled so that they may be offered more widely throughout the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And according to the plan, L.A. providers will focus on geographic areas with high numbers of youth and young adults from passive, prioritized populations and monitor for relevant demographic changes. The RNC recommends use of participatory grantmaking for this funding category.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'According to the plan participants, participatory grantmaking explicitly and intentionally brings together communities impacted by funding decisions together with funders to shift traditional power dynamics and funding decisions with the goal of empowering communities and creating lasting change. Council staff is working to determine how this aligns with county's procurement rules.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And on page 163 of your packet, you'll find table 12 in the Evaluation Criteria section. The plan recommends that DHS Performance Measurement and Evaluation Team lead a related evaluation work. The plan notes that initial outcome targets will be set at a later time in collaboration with funded partners and by passive staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that more or less concludes our staff report. We would be happy to take any questions you may have. And in addition, we have Sheila Capps, Danny, director of C D, Jackie Moynihan, Deputy Division Director for Housing, Homelessness, Community Development Division, and on a further mcconney implication manager.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Madam Chair, thank you so much, Erin and Patrick. But mostly Erin did most of the work and council members questions for our staff or executive staff. This is a first briefing. You will come back in August, but it's a good opportunity to ask questions you have right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sure we will have questions. We're taking it on board. I will say while people decide whether they're going to ask or not, that I really appreciate the work that's gone in. This has been such a stepwise process, starting with the I mean, back to the very first time I heard from Justin Farrell about the compromise in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Olympia that put this funding source into the stage three authorization legislation. And then there was just a not a lot of debate about it during the election, but afterwards it became clear that this was going to be a resource that would be unique.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm really proud of the work that this council did to try to make the most out of it, and especially to, for not the first time we've done this before, but in a really significant way, explicitly call out racial equity as something that we are going to to fund towards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then there was, of course, really hard work about the different buckets and levels of funding for each level of for each level of education. We set ourselves a goal of trying to spend this money deeply and not peanut butter and all over the place so that it has deep impact.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's one of the things I'm going to be looking for in looking at the spending plan. I think the engagement with the community has been outstanding in the creation of this and of this plan that's in front of us today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it shows in the amount of support that it received in from all the different folks who have been really advocating hard for investment in things that will help to improve outcomes for youth at all levels. So and I start the analysis of this program with it, it's just there's a lot of good work that's gone into'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it. The community support is really important to me. There may be little things here or there as we move forward, but I just speaking for myself, I don't I'm not feeling the need sitting here to do major amendments or major changes because we've really walked up to this point together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So councilmembers, anybody care to opine or ask? Council Chairman Eldridge, Councilmember Raquel Welch, please go ahead. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a couple of questions that I know when we take this up later as well. For one, I really appreciate the work that's been done by the community groups who have put in a great amount of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'time. And I know that our staff, our district staff have been working on this for a long time as well. So I really commend the implementation plan that we have before us and of course also the executive staff and all of their work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One question that I have is so with regard to United Way and I maybe Sheila knows the answer to this, but of Will United Way are. B How much of the funding that will go to United Way will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Retained as part of the administrative costs? Or is it something that United Way will be covering on there and. Thank you for that question, Councilmember. And hello. The the United Way what this project is actually. I'm sorry to interrupt you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could you say that you didn't just realize that I was talking through myself and Sheila Capps, Danny and the director of the Children, Youth and Young Adults Division and the Strategic Advisor for Revenue. And so I the Love and Liberation is a pilot project and it has these partnerships to it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'United Way is a partner will be providing capacity building and staffing for the Racial Equity Coalition to make sure that they have the foundation and the structure they need to get the work done. So the county will be will be funding that work that the United Way is doing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The United Way is not asking for a percentage and we're not giving a percentage to administration. I think. And Madam Chair, on a continuum, another question is that we know that the funding that we get from Southern Transit will be uneven.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will not be the same year by year. And depending on the construction that's underway on the part of some transit, there may be some years in which we have more revenue generated than other years. And I'm just wondering how this will affect the administrative process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it gives us some challenges. And I'm wondering if, Hannah, do you have an answer to that one? Yes. For the record, my name is Hannah. Honey, I work at sea my way. I am the custom being.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good afternoon, everybody. I would say we have looked at this 15 year budget really thoroughly and have based our assumptions on the latest estimates that we received from Sound Transit, which are from the end of April. So. So a couple of months back, we know that that is the latest information that we have and are moving forward'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with it. I would say about how we will handle handle the uneven distribution, which will probably still change as 15 years pass. So one thing is for administrative funding. We are planning and even spend down. So we are spreading the funds anticipating that our standard will be even across the years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's one one way we're handling our administrative and evaluate expenses. And then when we work with partners, once we have awarded contracts, then we will talk with them about how they want to handle their budgets. The one one strategy that we're employing from the get go is that we are thinking that implementation will be gradual and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as such we will be accruing some a remainder funds at the end of each year that could be spent on one year and may be useful as a strategy as the fund itself starts to wind down towards the end of the 15 year period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And one final question. Madam Chair, please go ahead. Thank you. Currently, we have a 7% administrative fee going to the county, and I'm wondering if that seems to be the right amount. I have actually offered an amendment that did not get approved by the council that would be at 5% so that we would have more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'funding going into the actual programs. But we do this 7%, and I'm wondering if that seems to be the appropriate amount thus far, or does it seem like we need more or less would do. Any feedback at this point?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's important to remember that that admin bucket is actually administration evaluation and capacity building. So it's 7% to accomplish all of those tasks. We're probably right at the edge of what is a good amount to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so is as we hold admin steady, hopefully if if the income in that bucket changes or we can put out to community around capacity building. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Szabo, please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks, Madam Chair. Hey, Sheila. How you doing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have some pretty elementary questions. So the implementation plan just confirming this is agreeing to the bucket or categories of spending and not allocating anything to specific organizations. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, that's for two of the buckets. That is true. What we are with the third bucket around the community. The community supports that 10%. That pilot project is already a predetermined group for the pilot project. That's similar to a couple of projects we did under BSC.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that is a closed amount. That is 10% of the 93% after admin eval and AC that was taken out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gotcha. And who who are those neighbors that I don't think I see them yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you happen to have that list in front of you? A lot of them testified today for public comment. Yeah. Aaron, as of 258, what's the pitch number? I actually have them right in front of me if you'd like to agree it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sure the four C Coalition, all girl, everything. Ultimate program, also known as Age Up Education. Excuse me. Asian Counseling and Referral Services, Community Passageways, Education with Purpose Foundation for Pacific Islanders. El Centro de la Raza Follis Community Services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'East Federal Way Youth Action Team, Filipino Community of Seattle Glover Empowering Mentoring Open Doors for Multicultural Families Para Los Ninos Powerful Voices. Red Eagle Soaring and United Way of King County. That's how I was at the end of, you know, organizations that belong to the Racial Equity Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any more questions? They're like, maybe we lost him.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we may have lost control resolve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, let's take a quick moment here. Are they are high. Sorry, Councilmember, I couldn't hear if you had. If that was the end.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I lost everybody. No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you hear me now? It can't hear us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Let's carry on and we'll see if we can help Rosalie with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's okay. I'm so sorry. Anybody else? Counselor Rizal, I'm going to pause you for a second. Anyone else have questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'About the growth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the growth? Please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. It's more of just a comment. One of the areas I'm interested in continuing to explore is within the college career and technical education section. We've called the promise that Sorry is making sure that the way that is structured allows for as robust as possible community based decision making.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we do a really good job of that in the K-12, and there may be some ideas to kind of clarify or strengthen the wording in a couple of areas so that the the community based organization envisioned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are things called the systems supporting organization will be really a true partner with the department in developing recommendations. And so I wanted to flag that as an issue. I chatted briefly with with Sheila about that, and I don't have specific recommendations at this point, but I'm talking with the stakeholders and we'll be talking with the department'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and may have some amendments to bring forward. So that was a comment and a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not a question. Got it. Okay. Other members. I'm not hearing any. Let me just state again for the record that this is the first briefing. We will have a second, according to counsel to committee of the whole chair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'MCDERMOTT That is probably going to be the time for amendments. So there will be some time between now and then with the caveat that we're on break and at the direction of leadership, many staff members are going to be taking some time off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So probably we'll be working on amendments the first two weeks of August, but we will have more time after that. All right. Any further questions? I'm going to pause this for a second because I have a message here that I was trying to get back in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there he is. Cancer marsala in years. Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it'll take just a second for him to cut their incomes.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Is also. Sorry. Everyone, can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Yes. Please continue. Well, we got to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Worry about that. I completely missed that the whole answer, but I think I got an email with the list. So I'll I'll look into that and I'll let me collect myself for a second. And you can please go ahead without me for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So I was just I was just repeating for purposes of hopefully setting the expectation that there will be more time to ask questions, get answers. This is scheduled to come back August 25th, a committee of the whole.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that means that there will be not time plus plus a final council passage. So even if we can't get to today due to technical glitches, which are always so disappointing when they happen and you wish you could do something about them, but they happen, we will have time to get back to to those any issues that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'members want to raise. So I would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ask one follow up question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, please go ahead. And as many as you need to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Sheila. If your organization or project want to access some of the early learnings that are capital funds in that bucket, from what what is the process like for that? What do they need to have in order to do that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, we will have we'll have an RFP process and there's going to be a lot of support around getting information out in our communities about that opportunity and also being able to help people as they think about is this the type of funding source that's going to be useful for them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd love to see actually if if Jacqueline, if you have any more information about how that might happen, nothing is written in stone yet, but how we've done it in the past with capital projects. Sure happy to. Jackie Moynihan, assistant Division Director for Housing, Homelessness and Community Development Division.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'But there would be an RFP and procurement process that would be run in coordination with DHS. So she was bringing there would be significant outreach of getting the word out into the community and also assistance provided to them to work with folks to make sure that that is appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think part of the plan that is before you also includes a phase where there is some pre-development work that happens that helps test whether the project is a feasible project before you move into committing the multiple millions of dollars that would be needed to construct and facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Further questions. Okay. I believe we will have more discussion, undoubtedly. And we thank you for this opening briefing. And the good questions and answers will be back to those together in earnest. So. That concludes the action item on our agenda today.'"
