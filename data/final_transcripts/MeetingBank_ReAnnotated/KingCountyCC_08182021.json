        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council members a hello. This is your audience. Did you want to offer opening comments? Sure. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. Really excited to increase Tony Wright's empire. No, I'm kidding. I just wanted to throw a little joke out there and make him uncomfortable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm excited to put forward the Surplus Land and Buildings ordinance today and get the feedback of my colleagues. As we've all been seeing, demand for safe indoor spaces has never been higher in our region. Not only have gentrification and displacement been making it harder for people to stay indoors, but so many pressures are making it harder to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'even be outdoors. Temperatures outside are either scorching or freezing. There's smoke clogging our air. The pandemic has come roaring back, gun violence is spiking and so on and so forth. So all these issues tell me we can leave no stone unturned to increase indoor options for the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If King County owns buildings or land that isn't using for long periods, we should make those spaces available to our communities. Organizations could then use those spaces for housing, health clinics, office space, after school activities, and I'm sure all of my colleagues can vouch for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But every week I hear from organizations that want to serve their communities and really important ways, but they don't have the physical space to do so in a region that pushes so many people out. I would say that's the thing that I hear from my constituents about the most.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We want a physical space to either do our work, provide housing, provide care for our communities, but we just don't have the space to exist anymore in this region. So my legislation would require King County to conduct a surplus property analysis on county owned real property that it hasn't been using for long periods, at least two years'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And then it would establish a publicly accessible database of surplus property owned by our county so that communities or organizations could check to see what's available. I hope this ordinance plays a part in getting people indoors and using our existing resources more effectively.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I look forward to hearing thoughts, concerns and ways to improve the legislation for all of my colleagues. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Question comments. Questions from colleagues. Councilmember Banducci.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I want to first say thank you to Councilman Rizal. I have for thinking about ways that we can continue to use the resources that we have to support this really important work. We know that we have a housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had a real housing challenge prior to COVID, and it's only gotten more challenging since then. So I think that knowing what tools we have in the toolbox and being transparent about that and, you know, holding up to the light, anything that we might be able to do is a really valuable exercise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just wanted to say that up front, there are definitely reasons why the county might want to retain property that it is not currently using. And but I think that having a full inventory of what our properties are and which ones we're holding on to for reasons and what those reasons are would be a very'",
        "'speaker_1': 'valuable thing to do. Just to give an example, and this is a hypothetical that I'm actually generalizing from a city that I know you can hold on to surplus property sometimes for a very long time because you think, for example, that you may need to expand your solid waste capacity or your wastewater capacity and you're holding onto'",
        "'speaker_1': 'property because you think you might put a facility there someday. And it's you know, it saves you a great deal of cost when you need to do that. And those are also really important priorities for the county. So I wouldn't want us to rush headlong into let's get rid of all our property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is I understand it is a let's understand what all our property is, where it is. Make sure that is public and that we are being intentional about when we're hanging onto property for important reasons and thinking about how we can use the property we really, truly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Don't need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'More quickly and more effectively. So if I understand that correctly, I think this is a really good a really good proposal, definitely in line with other policies that the council has pursued over the last several years. But I would love to hear what Mr. Wright has to say about the expansion of his empire that would be of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'interest to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Empire Commander. Right. You're on mute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. And I'm I'm following our inside county buildings policy with the mask. So you can't see me smiling and laughing at the comment. So I. But that's good. I, I, I think this is a this is just clarify something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the ASP, especially the aspect of the database, I think the database to track all of this because of the history of the county and how it was formed in the merger with Metro and stuff. There's a lot of complexities to the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have portions of the the county that can acquire property but can't dispose of it. So having a consolidated means for us to track these and fine tuning the reporting system which we already have underway, I think is going to be really, really helpful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the evaluation of need, I think, is is an important aspect. And leaving that discretion for facilities that we that may be needed five or six years in the future because they have a clear plan that's moving towards that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but identifying that means you have five or six years where that that facility might be usable. Being able to capture those particular elements, I think is going to be very useful. I look forward to asking for more money in order to do this database and expand my empire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But no, I think we support this supports legislation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Security Council members. Hello. Thank you. Thank you so much for that, Tony. And I also wanted to just build on what Councilmember Baldacci was mentioning, even if it's not to completely transfer or quote unquote, get rid of surplus land in in the period where we're not using it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The public could get great benefit from being able to use buildings or space in the interim. You know, five years is enough to provide, you know, a safe place for people to go for five years, for organizations to build out their capacity until they can find their own permanent location.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just being able to use these spaces more efficiently is something that I think is beyond valuable. Thank you. You're welcome. Are there further questions? Is there a desire to have the opportunity to take this up in committee in the future?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there an interest in emotion today? I would like to move it today and most our colleagues want to discuss it more in committee. I would be happy to wait as well. People have more thoughts they want to work through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Bell, DC, you're off mute. Are you telling me some? You want to be talk?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just will state my support for voting today if you need that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ismail. I think you should make a motion and take your chances. So move. Mr. Chair, I would like to move the legislation. Thank you. Motion Councilmember Zelaya's moves. We give a to pass recommendation to ordinance 2021 to 57.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any further discussion? Madam Couric, would you please call the roll?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Biology Councilmember Dombrowski.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Dunn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Was a member Kowalski I council member Lambert. Coffman Lumber I council member of the call. I council member one night that. I found some members online.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair. The vote is eight I's Council Member ten voting no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. By your vote, we've given a do pass recommendation to ordinance 2021. 257 will advance that to full council on the regular calendar and in regular timeline. Madam Clerk, did we miss any votes today?'"
