    "Health through Housing Fund Ordinance.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'That takes us to the next two items on the agenda that we'll take up together as they both relate to a proposed sales and use tax to be used for housing and associated services. April Sanders is here from the Council Central South to provide the staff report for these items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ms.. Sanders, the line is yours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. For the record, April Sanders Council policy staff and item seven begins on page 13 in your packet and the Post Ordinance 2020 0337 would impose a 1/10 of a percent sales tax for housing and related services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Proceeds from the tax will be deposited into the health through Housing Fund, which would be created through proposed ordinance 2020 0319, which I'll brief later on, starting with a bit of background information. During the 2020 legislative session, the Legislature passed House Bill 1590, which amended provisions for the housing sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Previously, the sales tax was required to go to the ballot for authorization from voters before an actual. The House bill, 59, provided the option for the tax to be council. Manic counties were given until September 20th 30th of 2020 to impose the tax countywide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'After that, the cities could impose the tax in the county with no tax after one or more of the cities have already done so. The county must provide a credit to those cities for the full amount collected within their jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At the time of this statute that I wrote the staff report. No cities had enacted the tax, however. Last night, at least four cities passed legislation imposing the housing sales tax within their jurisdiction, which will have revenue impacts should the Council pass a similar tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'State statute specifies the activities and services for which the tax may be used. Table one on page 14 provides an overview of spending allocation requirements. At least 60% of proceeds must go to the following three purposes. One Constructing affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two, constructing mental, mental and behavioral health related facilities. And three, funding operations and maintenance of new affordable housing and facilities where housing related programs are provided or newly constructed evaluation and treatment centers. All remaining funds must be used for operation delivery or evaluation of mental and behavioral health treatment programs and services or housing related services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additionally, the state statute requires that only the following population groups with at or below 60% area median income for King County may be provided affordable housing and facilities providing housing related programs generated using this tax revenue. Persons with behavioral health disabilities, veterans, homeless or those at risk of being homeless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Families with children accompanied homeless, unaccompanied homeless youth or young adults. Persons with disabilities and domestic violence survivors. Counties imposing the tax must consult with cities when siting facilities within jurisdictional boundaries, and the county must spend at least 30% of revenue collected within any city, with a population over 60,000 within that jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Currently, the following cities have populations over 60,000. Seattle, Bellevue, Kent, Renton, Federal Way, Kirkland, Auburn, Redmond and Sydney image. Lastly, the state statute allows for counties to issue general obligation or revenue bonds and pledge up to 50% of the moneys collected for bond repayment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bonded revenue may finance provision or construction of affordable housing facilities where housing related programs are provided or evaluation and treatment centers. Now, moving on to the proposed ordinance in front of you, it would impose a housing sales tax named the health through housing tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many of the provisions in the state code are reiterated in the proposed ordinance, so I'll not review those that I have discussed previously, but that it would prioritize those whose income does not exceed 30% ami of King County and who are in the population groups I described previously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additionally, proceeds will be allocated with the objective of reducing racial and ethnic disproportionality among those experiencing chronic homelessness. The specification of 30% AMI and the objectives that I just mentioned are set forth in the proposed ordinance for the not required by state statute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The proposed ordinance would also provide the county with the authority to issue bonds and use up to 50% of the moneys collected for a repayment of those bonds. The executive has indicated through the biennial budget proposal an intent to develop a bond package for 400 million over the next biennium.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Moving on to some timing considerations. State law requires that a local sales and use tax change may take effect no sooner than 75 days after the Department of Revenue receives notice of those changes. Executive staff indicate that final passage by council is sufficient to notify the department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additionally, collection can only begin on the first day of January, April or July of any given year. Table two on page 16 reveals various scenarios for council passage. If Council passes legislation by October 17. Collections could begin in January of 2021.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alternatively, if council passes legislation by January 15th, collections would be in an April. I included revenue estimates for each collection date, but I would note that these estimates assume county action before any cities impose the tax. So it's slightly outdated as of last night.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to touch briefly on the executive's proposal for these funds in the biennial budget, though these would not be decided in this legislation but rather in budget deliberations. The executive proposes the following distribution with the health or housing allocation across various appropriation units behavioral health at 8.7 million housing and community development with 446.7 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the bonded revenue, plus an additional 46,000,000.7 million. The Healthier Housing Fund 96.7 million. And the Debt Service Fund 36.9 million. Not up for discussion today, but relevant to the conversation is proposed ordinance 2020 0338, which would require the executive to transmit a proposed initial health through housing implementation plan by next June 30th for approval by Council'",
        "'speaker_1': '. This proposed ordinance details specific items to be included in the plan and is a mandatory tool for all that has been referred to both the Committee of the Whole and Regional Policy Committee. That brings me to the end of the week on this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, I'm happy to jump right into briefing 0319 or I can take a pause for this item and brief that that after the fact. And there are amendments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why don't you go ahead and brief? 319. I think that'll be quick and won't add any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Perfect. So item eight begins on page 19 of your packet and its proposed ordinance 2020 0319, which would establish the health through housing fund and add a new chapter to King County Code. Chapter four A to codify the fund creation is ordinance only needs to be adopted if the Council adopts legislation to impose the housing sales tax'",
        "'speaker_1': '. The Department of Community and Human Services would serve as the manager of the fund and proceeds would be spent in accordance with the authorizing state statute. Additional direction on allocations of these moneys would be through proposed ordinance on 33037 imposing the sales tax as well as proposed ordinance 2020 0338 directing the creation of the implementation plan and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Loeffler floor and Mark Brooke are both on the line to take questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, April, for briefing both ordinances 2023, three, eight and 319 colleagues. Other questions about the briefing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seeing no questions. I call on Councilmember Balducci to move adoption of 338.'",
        "'speaker_1': '0337 Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': '337.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman, of adoption of Proposed Ordinance 2020 337 with a good pass recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Bell. She has moved adoption of Ordinance 2020 337 with a deposit recommendation. Thank you, Councilmember, for making that motion. I'll ask if there are any amendments, I guess, before we move to speeches on the ordinance as introduced.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You. So far. And I asked this before, but I asked if there's any chance that this will go on for ten years, 20 years, 30 years. And what would be the cost to each citizen? Average cost that 60%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Median income, 80%. 100% median income. So we know what this costs, the people who will be paying for it. Sure. So this is an ongoing tax council member. So there's not a sunset date in it. And as far as the expected cost for each individual and it vary greatly, I can try to ask the wife about possible'",
        "'speaker_1': 'per per individual costs. And then I'd follow up with you offline. That would be great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dombrowski.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Dombrowski.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I distributed two possible amendments for the purpose of surfacing them, but I am just by way of background. Maybe Kendall Moore would need to advise on this, but the ordinance here makes a couple of appall, I think makes at least it makes two policy calls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One is under the state statute, I think these funds are restricted to 0 to 60% ammo. We we're deciding here today to limit it to 0 to 30. I want to say I support going into that space. Our regional affordable housing plan said we should use public resources to fill the 0 to 50% niche as much as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'possible because that's that's where there's, you know, the deepest need. And we thought we could do the most good. And I think there's 44,000 units of need there. We're going even deeper here with the 0 to 30. So I'm not objecting at all to the to the policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just you know, we have a regional policy committee. And to the extent this is a making a regional policy, it may be the safer place since we're going to be asking bond counsel to issue an opinion letter on this, to issue 400 plus million dollars of debt would be to make sure we're being very true to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our our processes with respect to referral to the regional committee. So I had an amendment that would read the intent was, although I don't think it's quite there was to make sure we're just true to the statute in the in the ordinance that adopts the tax and we don't have any problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't from a policy perspective, I will say again, I think that it's right with respect to the Executive's proposal to prioritize the 0 to 3. I know there's some issues around that, but that's where I am on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other amendment I, I want to again, I think it's probably more appropriate over in the implementation plan, but the statute has this 60,000 city population provision where it says in those cities the county will spend not we don't turn the money over to the cities, but the county will spend 30% of the funds raised in those'",
        "'speaker_3': 'jurisdictions, in those jurisdictions. I think maybe all of us except Councilman Rocco Health and Councilmember Rizal, I have cities in whole or in part that are under that. The North End is a collection of cities less than 60,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they, in my discussions with them, want to be a regional team player and everything and have looked at adopting the tax like some cities are doing, that they would rather partner with the county but have some return on the money raised in their cities to help house folks and provide housing in the communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So my my Second Amendment let me it's the First Amendment, but maybe I'll call it the second councilmember. Lambert You might like that better. Councilmember Dunn two Anyway, sorry. The amendment would say, hey, if it's, if cities want to or more want to get together such that their population would exceed 60,000 to for the purposes of partnering'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to provide these services and housing in the community that we would spend that 30% we treat them like a 60,000 population city. And I, I think, you know, one, it's kind of a regional distribution of fairness. Issue two, there's needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Countywide three, I think it will force us to not, frankly, go provide all of this housing in a very few communities. And we'll kind of share the share the benefits and the burdens, if you will. So I don't know that any cities would would do it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It doesn't dilute the county's big picture spending in any way or anything else, but it says, hey, let's let's provide resources. County, county wide. I think it probably needs some more discussion and dialog. So I don't intend to offer it today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, I'm not sure this is even the right vehicle under our rules, but I want to service it with you all, let you know because this is moving so quickly and you're seeing that by cities adopting some of the tax locally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But maybe there's an opportunity to strengthen the regional partnership here, but giving a little more another path for some of our smaller cities to come together and be participants. So I want to surface those to you today. I will say, well, I have the floor, so maybe I can just speak once, Mr. Chair, that I'm very supportive'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of this initiative I introduced in 2017, the 10th of a penny sales tax under the statute when it took the voters approval, it wasn't just council magic then. So I really do. Even though this is a regressive tax, I think that it's the right thing to do and we adopted it then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have been collecting revenues for three years and be well on our way. But. It. It really could if if it works out, if we were able to bring on 2000 units, make a real dent in the 4500 to 6500, depending on which number you look at after the third door coalition's identified need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I like, I like the acquisition notion. I know we have to go down to Olympia and get a change there. At least I think we do because it shrinks the time from four or five years to design and permit and construct the unit down to something a lot less.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The costs are lower. They could be half as much as the $450,000 a unit that we pay for permanent supportive housing today. So I like the notion a lot have been pushing all year to use Cares Act money to acquire hotels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that could be good in my district. I want to say, you know, these aren't easy. We are supporting the city of shoreline and they can get a housing authority to acquire a care facility with a little over 60 rooms to bring on shelter service, but in a permanent and supportive way with Lake City Partners'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So I'm pretty excited about this because I think it can make a big dent in it. But I'm going to ask my colleagues to take a look. Even if you don't have a lot of little cities, you might have a smaller city that would like to partner with one of your bigger cities and do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I wanted to service that. I appreciate you giving me the chance to do that today, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to supporting this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Dombrowski. And as the sponsor of this legislation before us today, I share your excitement for the opportunity it presents to us. It truly gives us the opportunity to address chronic homelessness, people experiencing chronic homelessness, and move them into not only housing, but supportive housing in ways that we don't have the resources identified elsewhere to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'do. And I agree that the sales tax is not a progressive tax form. But the most regressive thing about the conversation we're having today is 4500 to over 6000 people living in chronic homelessness on the streets of our communities throughout King County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the most regressive thing we will consider all day. And the progressive response is to move them into housing with the support they need to be successful in doing that. The plan brought before us from the executive and as introduced, would allow us to bond against the sales tax for about $400 million in the first year and'",

Given the current market conditions offered for sale and particularly affordable and gives us the ability to strike fast, to move fast with a sense of urgency and nimbleness that we have lacked, frankly, in our response'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to chronic homelessness. Since the emergency for Homelessness was declared in November 2015 by the then mayor of Seattle and the county executive. This gives us the opportunity to respond and invest. And in one count of those who are chronically homelessness, there's a particular need, I think, to cite and be aware of the disproportionality that we'd be addressing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'because of that population. Fully 23% are Native American or Alaska Natives, and 12% are black or African American. The disproportionality within homelessness in general, but particularly within this chronic homelessness population, is critical, and this is a key opportunity for us to have a coordinated response and address moving people into home housing in which they can be successful'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Other discussion questions. Debate. Colleagues. Councilmember Dombrowski.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll just jump in I think because some folks may be looking at in the executive prepared a helpful infographic summarizing the proposal and I just want to know they did not I think by accident missed in these authorized populations veterans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But your legislation as introduced, Mr. Chair, does include all of the groups in the statute, including veterans.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much. Very much so, yes. Having no further discussion. I asked the clerk to please call the roll.'",

As you noted, proposed motion 2020 0299 would approve Metro's public transportation agency's safety plan prior to being submitted to the Federal Transit Administration or FTA, which is required by'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And by your approval, you'd essentially be certifying regulatory compliance that this plan meets the FTA requirements. So what I'd like to do is very quickly just run through what those requirements are and certify that staff has reviewed this and determined it to be in compliance and then present a technical amendment for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So moving on to page 43, I'll note that not all of Metro services are covered in this plan. First, water taxi service is not because the water taxi safety is regulated by the Coast Guard, not the FTA. And in addition, the services that Metro operates for sound transit and the City of Seattle are not covered because those'",

So category one is basic information about the agency, including its name, its address, the types of services it operates, and the types of FTA funding it receives.'",

Category three can be found on page 49, and that is Metro's reiteration of the safety performance targets it keeps for fatalities, injuries, safety events and system reliability. These targets are all set by the federal government, and then Metro has a way that it tracks how its service matches up for each'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I don't really need an answer. I just want to make the point. Here's another unfunded mandate, and we have to figure out the money for it when we have other issues. So it's great work. I think we could probably be a lot less verbose than some of their requirements and we'd be happy to do it'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Especially if they pay for it. Councilmember Lambert, can I address your concern? Sure. Okay. This is replacing a preexisting mandate from the FTA. This is just the latest method of managing safety on our system. So it's nothing it's nothing new.'",

    "Revision of the Districting Committee Appointment Process and Ordinance 5327.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. By your vote, we've given a do pass recommendation to a motion 2020 299. We will expedite that to full council next Tuesday and place it on consent. It takes us to item ten. Our final agenda item for today is a motion that would revise the appointment process for the District and Committee, which redraws the County'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council district boundaries every ten years informed by the annual the decimal census. Patrick Hamacher, the director of Council Initiatives, is here to provide this report. Mr. Hamacher, the screen is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and council members. Good afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Patrick Hamacher, Council Staff. The materials for this item are at the end of your packet and they begin on page 163. The county charter, as you noted in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your introduction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Requires that the district for the offices of County Council member be redrawn every ten years. The next time they need to be redrawn is by the end of 2021. So coming up prior to 2008 and the passage of Initiative 26, the office was actually a partizan office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So council members would run as as a representative of their political parties. Council Initiative 26 made the offices nonpartizan. However, the code has never been updated to remove the partizan references from the code section pertaining to redistricting and actually calls for PARTIZAN appointments to the District and Commission to fully understand what the district doing process requires.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You actually need to reference state law, the county charter and county code. And so just by way of background, a quickly go through that state law and the charter. And now on the bottom of page one, 63 state law and the charter both require require a district due process every ten years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'RTW 29 876 actually lays out criteria that any district team process must meet and the highlights of those districts district requirements are laid out on the bottom there. I'll go over them very quickly. The population in each district must be as equal as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Districts must be as compact as possible. Districts must be geographic. Must be a geographical contiguous area. Population data cannot be used to favor or disfavor one racial group. Population data must be not used to favor or disfavor one political party.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to the extent possible, districts should use existing natural boundaries and preserve existing communities of related and mutual interest. So those are the criteria laid out in state law. And largely what that does in Washington state is prevent some of the kind of crazy, crazily drawn, gerrymandered districts that you might see, particularly with congressional districts and other'",
        "'speaker_0': 'states. The district can process also has criteria laid out in the county charter. So I've now moved on to page 164. On the top of the page there, Section 650 of the county charter lays out the criteria of the district being process, and it requires a district in committee to be appointed every ten years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The next one, as we noted, coming up at the beginning of 2021. The council under this process appoints four members, and those four members appoint the fifth member who serves as chair of the district being committee. The committee also needs to select what the charter calls a district master.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In this case, think of it as a person or firm that actually is responsible for drawing the maps and coming up with coming up with a district to report which which approves the new districts. And the work must be complete by December 31st of the year, the committee begins.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in this case, it would need to be completed by December 31st of next year. Finally, the part that is covered by this ordinance, Section 122 of the King County Code places additional criteria on the membership and the appointment process for the district in committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are two key provisions there. Each council member may nominate someone from the council members political party and the county council shall appoint two Republican and two Democratic nominees to the committee. So those two provisions are essentially the bulk of what's in Section 122 of the code, and both would be changed by the proposed ordinance as before'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the before the committee now just four years. And because it's a relatively straightforward matter, I've actually included towards the bottom of page 164, I've included how each section would look as affected by this ordinance. And so the first section would be amended to add a little bit of process around the appointment process, and it would include new'",
        "'speaker_0': 'language that it would see by December 1st, December 1st of the December preceding a district in committee process. So that's a little clunky, but it's because of how it's drawn. So it would be this December by written notice to the chair of the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Each council member may nominate a person to serve on the district committee. So what gets removed there is of the council members political party and that the chair of the council show cause to be introduced or introduce a motion for consideration and action by the Council that appoints the District Committee as described in the next section.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would be the process where the Council would appoint the four members that are the council appointees. Those four members would then go on to appoint the remaining member. The moving to now, page 165, the second section of KCC 122 would be amended to remove, as it's shown there, the requirement that two appointees from each of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the Democratic and Republican Party parties be nominated and instead replace that language with language cover that states. In appointing the members of the committee, the Council should consider equity and attempt to represent the demographic, geographic and political diversity of the county, and also that appointees to the committee should have a history of civic or community engagement and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have the necessary background and skill to actively participate in the district due process. So those are the bulk of the changes. Those are all of the changes actually that would be made by this ordinance. And it would bring the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remaining section or the King County Code in compliance with the Charter as it was amended by Initiative 26. So taken together in the last section of this staff report, I just want to cover what the new process for districting would look like if this ordinance were passed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So step one, by December of this year, each of the County Council members may nominate by, in writing to the chair of the council, someone to serve on the committee. The Council chair would then introduce or caused to be introduced a motion appointing four four members of the committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The charter lays out that those members must be appointed by the end of January of next year. So sometime between December and the end of January, you would need to appoint the four members. Those four members will then vote to pick the fifth member of the District Committee who would serve as chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By April, the committee, the district committee should appoint the district master. And by the if for some reason the District Committee can't appoint the District Master by April one. The Council is then charged with selecting someone by the end of May.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hopefully that wouldn't come into play, but it's at least in the code structure, a section of the charter. And then by December 31, the District D.M. submits a plan to the committee. The committee must then adopt the plan with or without amendment within 15 days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So technically, this process could trickle over into the very early part of 2022 if the district master does not submit the plan until the very end of 2021, and that once the plan is approved by the committee and submitted to the clerk, the those become the new council districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in terms of the election schedule, these would probably not be the council districts until the 2023 council elections, unless somehow the district committee completed its work incredibly quickly, in other words, before the open enrollment or the registration period for the 2021 elections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which seems incredibly unlikely considering the work they would have to do. That concludes my staff report. Mr. Chair. Leonard Cohen from our legal counsel, it makes sense from the prosecutor's office, did a lot of help in helping to prepare this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to recognize their work as well, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Hamacher. Questions, colleagues. Councilmember Balducci for a motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman, of adoption of proposed ordinance number 2020 DASH 0298 with a do pass recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Bell Duties Moved Adoption of Motion 2020 298 with the due pass recommendation. Discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me speak to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Banducci.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Harker covered this really pretty well, but just for the purposes of those following law, this comes forward because we do every ten years adopt district boundaries for the districts within the Kane County Council. And ten years ago our charter had been changed to remove reference to these positions as being partizan, Democrat or Republican.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it wasn't fully implemented yet. Half of the council had switched over to nonpartisan, but there were still members on the council who were nominally Democrats and Republicans. And so the last charter commissioner and chair of the last District Commission retained this language around appointing two Democrats and two Republicans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we are fully nonpartisan now, as is the rest of all of the elected officials in acting, as are the rest of all the elected officials in King County. So this proposal thinks our ordinance and our process with our charter, and because the only requirements to be appointed in the ordinance prior to this change were that two'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of them be Democrats and two of them be Republicans. We have added some some language that is flexible enough that we can select people who are good and who bring a variety of backgrounds, experience, etc.. But, you know, also tell us a little bit about qualifications.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I urge your support and will be as we get through budget and all the other budgets that Councilmember Caldwell's was laying out today, we will also be starting to stand up our redistricting committees.'",
