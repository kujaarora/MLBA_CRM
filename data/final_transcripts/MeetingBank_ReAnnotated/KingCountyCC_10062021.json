    "Ordinance on Construction and Demolition Waste Agreements and Amendments.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. This takes us to item six, an ordinance that would make changes to the county's construction and demolition, or C and D code, as well as authorize the executive to enter into agreements with C and D receiving facilities using an updated agreement template.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As I think she will present the I have asked for some amendments to be drafted. I'm going to strike an amendment as one can be prepared. Ms.. Rose You can do your full briefing and you and I can take team on speaking to the striking amendment as you wrap up or however you want to proceed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sounds good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will follow your lead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Terra Rose, Council staff. The materials for this item begin on page nine of your packet, but I'm actually going to start from page then. If you're following along just some brief background. Construction and demolition waste or Sandy waste results from construction, remodeling, repair, or the demolition of buildings, roads or other structures.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Examples of Sandy waste include cleaned, painted or treated wood, dimensional lumber, concrete, asphalt, and other aggregates, among other materials. Sandy Waste loads under Kane County Co can be characterized as non-recyclable, recyclable or mixed, which means the load is comprised of kiddy waste containing both recyclable and non-recyclable elements that have not been separated since 1993.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The county has banned Sandy Waste at most of its facilities, except for in incidental amounts or in limited circumstances. And those are where the county owned transfer stations comply with the recycling requirements in the Sandy code, or collect and transfer the materials to Sandy receiving facilities that have agreements with the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am now moving on to page 12. King County Code outlines requirements for Sandy Waste Processing and disposal states that the purpose of the Sandy Waste chapter is to assure that there will be Sandy disposal facilities to serve King County in accordance with the Comprehensive Salt Waste Management Plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sandy is recycled to the maximum extent feasible that the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill may continue to be dedicated to receiving municipal solid waste and that Sandy disposal is subject to King County's environmental controls and quote, So the way the system is set up, you have different responsibilities for different parts of the system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have the generators, handlers and collectors of the sea and waste. In other words, those either making it or transporting it. And then also the facilities that accept the waste by agreement. So similar to a typical curbside service where garbage goes one place and your recyclable materials go to another.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The different types of sandy loads are to go to different types of facilities. And I'll first start with the generators, handlers, collectors. Current King County Code requires all generators, handlers and collectors of mixed and non-recyclable sandy waste generated within the county's jurisdiction to deliver or ensure delivery to a designated Sandy receiving facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Recycling recyclable sandy materials, on the other hand, may be transported to any sandy recycling facility or to a recycling market in or outside of King County. Next requirements for the Sandy Receiving Facilities Ordinance 18166, which was adopted in 2015, allowed the county to enter into a uniform agreement referred to as the designated facility agreement or DFA with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'any qualified transfer facility, material recovery facility or Merv. Sorry, there will be a lot of abbreviations today or combination Murphy and Transfer Facility and the DFA between the facilities and the county set forth the terms and conditions under which it may be received, processed, recycled and disposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so for if you are interested in more specific information about the terms, some of the terms and the existing DFA that was approved by Ordinance 18166, I will refer you to Attachment six to the staff report, which can be found on page 145.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additionally, I'd note that King County Code requires the Solid Waste Division Director to develop, publish and update on the division's website a list of recyclable sandy materials that are banned from landfill disposal by the Sandy receiving facilities. And that list is found on pages 12 and 13 in your pocket.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm now going to move on to how enforcement works with the existing system. Enforcement of Sandy rules is handled by a Sandy enforcement lead within the Solid Waste Division, who initiates enforcement activities on both generators, handlers and collectors of Sandy Waste as well as the Sandy receiving facilities that accepted executive staff, indicate that enforcement activities for generators'",
        "'speaker_1': ', handlers and collectors include outreach and education in the field, monitoring new construction permits and reaching out to contractors, as well as monitoring shipments of Sandy on the highways or Sandy receiving facilities. The specifics of conducting enforcement depend on the type of facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In other words, it's slightly different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Murph compared to a transfer facility, but both involve on site inspections. And I'm now moving ahead to page 14 in your pocket. King County code allows for the Salt Waste Division director to determine when a facility is not in compliance and may suspend the owners rate to accept mixed and non-recyclable Sandy waste during the period of noncompliance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and executive staff indicate that since 2015. Facilities have had temporary suspensions. Civil penalties may also be involved in the enforcement of safety regulations under King County Code and Title 23. The civil fine for a violator with no previous similar code violations is $100, and for a violator with two or more previous violations of King County Code Title'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ten, which is a sideways title within the past 12 months, the civil fine is double the rate of the previous penalty. Moving ahead in the staff report, I'll note two other relevant features of the Sante system before moving on to the proposed ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The adopted 2020 Strategic Climate Action Plan, or ESCAP, included targets and a series of priority actions related to Sandy Waste Management. And specifically, I'll point you to performance measure GHG 20, which states by 2025 achieve an 8480 5% Sandy materials diversion rate for building development sites across King County, excluding Seattle and Walton County service area, and by'",
        "'speaker_1': '2030 achieve zero waste of sandy materials resources with economic value. And according to the 2020 US cap, the county wide recycling diversion rate of the material in 2017 was 80%. And then the second feature I'll point out is that the county imposes a $4 and 25 cent per ton fee on the disposal of Sandy waste generated in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the county's jurisdiction. And that's for the purposes of funding additional costs to manage the Sandy recycling and disposal program. So I'm going to now move ahead to the analysis section on page 15 of those audits, 2020 0243 would primarily make changes that can be categorized in three areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the transmittal letter indicates that the Department of Natural Resources and Parks engage with stakeholders in the sandy industry, including contractors, haulers and landfill operators of recycling facilities. An input from all parties was incorporated into the proposed legislation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll start with the first area. The proposed ordinance would add language to the Sandy Code, placing explicit responsibility on the generators, handlers and collectors of sandy waste to send Sandy loads to the proper facilities and including in code conditions upon which generators, handlers and collectors may deliver loans to transportation specifically as well as intermodal facilities and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'landfills. And the latter two of which I will discuss more in a moment. As noted previously, current code language requires all generators, handlers and collectors of mixed and non-recyclable Sandy waste to be delivered to designated Sandy receiving facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, code does not specify any other obligations of generators, handlers and collectors. Executive staff indicate that mixed sandy waste loads are intended to go to a material recovery facility or murf or a transfer facility with recycling capabilities so that the recyclable materials may be sorted out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the proposed ordinance would add language to the Sandy Code that a generator handler or collector of mixed sandy waste generated within the county's jurisdiction may not deliver or cause delivery of a load of mixed sandy waste to a transfer facility unless certain criteria are met.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And those criteria are for the generator handler or collector to ensure that the load contains no more than 20% of the readily recyclable Sandy material banned from landfill disposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Confirms before upon delivery that the transfer facility shall transfer the load to or otherwise manage the materials appropriately belong to the second area of the proposed changes. The proposed ordinance would expand the definition of Sandy receiving facilities to also include intermodal facilities and landfills.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'd like to clarify a statement made in the staff report. The staff report says that in current code, only Murphy and transferred transfer stations or a combination facility can become a Sandy receiving facility. It would be perhaps more accurate to say that the current definition of Sandy receiving facility and code only specifically calls out Murphy and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'transfer stations for a combination facility, but that there is some ambiguity on whether other facilities can be designated by the division director. So apologies for that inaccuracy. The proposed ordinance would then explicitly allow intermodal facilities and landfills to receive Sandy waste under certain circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so under the proposed ordinance, only an eligible Sandy demolition project may use intermodal facilities and landfills for the disposal of non-recyclable Sandy waste and only in accordance with the waste diversion plan approved by the division and the proposed ordinance with limit eligible Sandy demolition projects, projects where buildings and other structures are demolished within a contained contiguous'",
        "'speaker_1': 'property, or the plan of consolidation and the square footage of building and structure space that will be demolished exceeds 6000 feet. Additionally, executive staff have confirmed that this legislation would not change what is allowed to be delivered to county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Facilities and that the division has no intention of allowing Sandy Waste to be directly disposed half of Israel's landfill and then moving ahead to enforcement of the use of intermodal facilities and landfills. The proposed ordinance would allow the division director and their sole discretion to prohibit any processing violates the requirements for direct, direct delivery of non-recyclable sandy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'waste to intermodal facilities or landfills from using those facilities for a period not to exceed six months. The staff report identifies two enforcement issues that potentially may occur with the legislation as transmitted. The first concerns potential use of intermodal facilities in landfills by unauthorized or suspended users.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The transmitted DFA would not explicitly require an intermodal facility or landfill to check that they were accepting waste from an eligible Sandy demolition project. With an approved waste diversion plan, they would be required to submit to the division a monthly report that provides information about each direct shipment received from demolition projects within the county's jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And additionally, the transmitted DFA would require the division to notify the facilities on suspensions of generators, handlers or collectors. And the facilities would then be responsible with comparing their customer lists on a monthly basis and alerting the division if any suspended users are using the facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thus, in either case, enforcement against the generator handler or collector could occur only after disposal has already happened. And then the second potential issue concerns the potential disposal of recyclable or mixed Sandy waste. As noted previously, the proposed ordinance would only allow non-recyclable Sandy waste to be delivered directly to an intermodal facility or landfill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, once waste containers are taken from a job site to the intermodal facility or landfill, the containers are typically not opened until the final disposal destination. Therefore, if a container included recyclables and waste, it was not only limited to non recyclables anyways in the contents it may be difficult to know it was disposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Executive staff indicate that while they do not have jurisdiction to enter job sites Inc. Cities Site access to view container contents does not been an issue in enforcement efforts to date. Additionally, executive staff note that they expect many of the eligible Sandy demolition projects to be owned by public agencies or public companies, which are typically cooperatives in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'working with the division to ensure compliance. And then finally, the third area of proposed changes that would be made by the ordinance. The proposed ordinance would authorize the executive to enter into agreements with Sandy receiving facilities substantially in the form of attachment a to this ordinance, which is an updated DFA template containing provisions for intermodal facilities and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'landfills. And I would again refer you to Attachment six to the staff report, which provides additional details about how the terms of the transmitted GFA differ from the existing GFA terms. And Mr. Chair, that concludes my remarks on the proposed ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you like me now to brief the amendments?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And I'm going to be Councilmember Caldwell's will have sympathy for me. I just got a note from a fossilized brain that Windows was going to try to close in 10 minutes. I will address that in a moment myself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I'm absent for a moment, my apologies and I'll be right back. And meanwhile, am indeed, as Ms.. Rose is about to discuss, we identified some inconsistencies in both the and the code as well as the transport ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm agreement to use the facilities that receive C and D waste. And so I've asked for an amendment as one to address some of those macros. If you would, please address that and I will address my Windows issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it. Understood. Striking amendment S-1, which is included in the packet and can be found beginning on page 76 with me clarifying edits to both the existing C and D code, and the proposed ordinance that were developed in collaboration with executive staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'S-1 would replace the transmitted DFA, which was dated May 22nd, 2020, with an updated GFA date of June 14th, 2021, and that was also developed in conjunction with executive staff. And additionally, as I noted in my earlier remarks, the transmitted DFA did not explicitly require an intermodal facility or landfill to check that they were accepting waste from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'an eligible Sandy demolition project with an approved waste diversion plan. And so Streicher, as one would add clarifying, would also add clarifying language that intermodal facilities are approved to accept Sandy waste only from eligible Sandy demolition projects. And if that facility has confirmation of an approved waste diversion plan either from the division.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or upon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Receipt of a copy prior to accepting waste. As one would also require the executive to file a report with the Council that describes the C and D enforcement activities undertaken by the division in the first year after the ordinance is effective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And additionally, it would change the effective date of the audience to January 1st, 2022. Attachment six is a summary matrix and compares the existing Sandy system with the changes proposed by proposed ordinance 2020 0243 as well as striking the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'S1 And I will note that there's also a title amendment, one that would not conform the title to the changes made by striking amendment. S1 And that concludes my remarks on the amendments. We also have a solid waste division director Pat McLaughlin and environmental programs managing supervisor Jim Neely here from executive staff, in case there are questions'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you. Questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lambert Council Member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lambert Thank you, Mr. Chair. So where are the mayors? I know there's one in Woodinville. I think there's one in Bellevue. Where are the other mayors? Customarily referring to the construction and demolition works. Yes. So there was a list on page 12 of your packet that lists all of the client designated facilities for C and D waste'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And I would defer to the executive staff if they want to call out specifically which are persons transport facilities, because that's going to be important that we differentiate between the two in the murf and wooden boat, which is the only one that by me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know how Sandy would go through that because the machinery is more for papers and bottles and newspapers and cardboard and glass, not for cement. And in our transfer stations, how much work do we have allocated for this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because some of them we don't have enough floor space, so that kind of thing. And to come in, they'll have one more question after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my name is Pat McLaughlin for the record service.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're always division director.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to just thank council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member and staff. Carol Rose did a tremendous job in terms of both your staff report and identifying some improvements to recommended changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm accompanied by Jim Neely. Jim has been with the division.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For over 20 years and for the better architect of this program. I'm somewhat sad to say he's also approaching retirement. I'm happy for him, sad for us. This is a pretty big milestone and we're grateful for his leadership that got us this far.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Lambert, Jim, could could speak directly to your interests in terms of the nature of the facilities that actually processes waste. It's not the King County facilities that process this waste. It is the private facilities which are more properly designed for a girl like Jim.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Expand on that. Sure. Thank you. I'm Jim Neely as commissioners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me so the facility Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That you're speaking of in Woodinville is a MSW that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Those. It does take seemed, but it only.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Transfers it to disposal. So it is not a material recovery facility. However, we have eight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of those throughout the region.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's three up in Snohomish County nearby. One of them's an unincorporated, well known fact and that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The sole purpose of those facilities is to recycle C and D. They have the sorting lines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They have the people that pick materials off of them, magnets, those sort of things. And that's that's all they do, basically. So as I said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's three up north there. There's one, two in Seattle, one in Renton, and one down in Tacoma. Two in writing. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. Obviously Sonoma County is out of our county. And I know that they in the past have also been interested in their capacity being able to keep up with their county's needs. And same with the. So it seems like there would be added costs to the Sandy distributions because these are big trucks that need to go far'",
        "'speaker_1': 'distances which adds to greenhouse gases and hurts the roads. So am interested in that and then your appeal process. Is there an appeal process for somebody being told that they're in noncompliance? Six months is a really long time, and I know many of the job sites have had to do a triple waste facilities outside their construction so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that they can sort. And the business have been very careful about making sure which bin is which because they don't want to get in trouble. But is there an appeal process? Should that contractor believe that they actually did try to get them well separated into the various streams of garbage?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'During the summer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was just as a council member. So the six months suspension process is just for the contractor to use direct delivery to intermodal facilities and landfills. There's always division, I can confirm, but my understanding is that they would still be permitted to use other facilities, but they would just lose the benefit of the direct delivery during that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'period, which then adds how many miles to the issue of how far they have to take it. Well, they would still be permitted to use some of the other facilities that are listed on table one within the county and Squamish County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what motivated this massive change for the necessity for this change for the addition of intermodal facilities and landfills? Yeah. And the total costs incurred because they don't think that same cost is put on non unincorporated area in the projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or is it? I know from division staff that this the request to be able to use intermodal facilities and landfills came as a result of the the input from contractors and other entities in the candy sector is not answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not quite following. So the agencies themselves, the private sector is is happy with this or not happy with this. I haven't gotten any calls from any of them telling me they're happy or not happy. I do what I can to stop on their outreach process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Cast Member. In developing this legislation, we engage a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wide variety of stakeholders across the industry. That included contractors, haulers, landfill operators who are also operating the recycling facilities through their work. We were able to influence the direction of this legislation and as Terry mentioned, this specific element of being able to divert right from the job site was a specific interest of both of those stakeholders.'",

If we are prepared to move this out today, I understand that it could move out, but it doesn't have to move out.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'My book, Oil Wells.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I know we're all very aware of many of the concerns that have been expressed quite a while now, for many years, and further regarding the safety and security issues in City Hall Park owned by this by the city, but adjoining our courthouse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But not everyone who may be watching this will be fully aware of everything. So I'd like to go over a few. Before the pandemic struck over a year and a half ago. There have been efforts to clean up the park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to especially command Councilmember Wright and Baskin's former city council members Sally Bagshaw and Caroline Williamson with FMG for all that they did. And it was wonderful too to view the food trucks music playing. We saw there were bathroom facilities and the courts in the court, city car park generally that's really looking pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is still issues pertaining to the Third Avenue entrance, still hearing many jurors being afraid to come to the courthouse. Many employees being actually attacked upon leaving the courthouse. But when the pandemic struck, we saw some big changes, as particularly as the street traffic diminished because so many businesses and including our own council and other courthouse offices'",
        "'speaker_1': 'had their employees go home and work remotely. There was there was less visibility of people just around. And as a result, we started seeing people camping out in the park and it resulted in a very large encampment. And much of that to do because of the extreme lack of affordable housing in the area and throughout the town'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But it became really very, very severe. And in terms of violence, a two year old little girl being and we don't know if she was abandoned or what, but inside that encampment, there was also an employee of the courthouse attacked, sexually attacked, and one of the bathrooms inside the courthouse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've heard from the judges and I appreciate Judge Darnell speaking the day Judge Rogers is the presiding superior court judge emailed me and said, I'm sorry, I can't be there, I'm sick and I'm in Montana, but I know all the judges support this motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They've had to put up barriers and windows, bulletproof glass because of shots coming from the park area. And I could go on and on with this, but it's been very obvious that something that's needed to be done and that has been juxtaposed, the severe lack of police officers and the Seattle Police Department, as I understand, they're down'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about 300 officers. So they've had to triage and make decisions on priorities. And too frequently we have found that they don't come to the park. This is before it was all closed off recently. They don't come around Third Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we've had to put in our budget funding for our sheriff's deputies and most of them have had to do this over time to just kind of keep track of what's going on. Also with the FMG officers, we shouldn't have to be it and we don't they don't have authority to take action when needed within the park'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So the situation has done worse and worse and we didn't prove quite a lot of funds for the Public Defenders Association and other partners in the community to help out people in the encampment with the Just Care program and get them on the way for permanent supportive housing or whatever it would be that they would need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But as Baby said, what happens when the park fences come down? It's my view that the county is the one that should own this park. And the plan had been for so long for that to happen and it's time that it happened.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now we need to have a situation where we are in control of the park and we can determine what goes on there to protect the public. To protect employees of the courthouse so they feel comfortable coming to work to protect them as leaving the courthouse to after work, to protect the public from accessing this center of government'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for all King County and the center of access to justice for all of King County and beyond. Contrary to what an individual said in public comment that this should not be done because there are other areas of the county that need public public health, public security, public safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is the center where people come to access justice, and that should be open and it should be safe. So I have been working with the consecutive and with the mayor of the city of Seattle. It is my understanding that the signal to Seattle is agreeable to transfer ownership to the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In fact, the mayor of Seattle said, You have a dollar. The Park Insurance. Executive has been working with the mayor to actualize that. And I believe we need to take hold of this opportunity that we have and grab it and have control of our own destiny and protecting the public and protecting everybody from being able to access'",
        "'speaker_1': 'county government and access to justice. The judges are all for this, and I know that many of you are as well. And I appreciate Councilmember Peter Van right there for holding a briefing on this and heads up the Government of Government Accountability and Oversight Committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Councilmember Lambert doing the same in her community Health and Housing Services Committee. Another factor here is that of the entrance to the courthouse since we own the park. One thing we could be able to do would be to change the entrance and egress to the courthouse, to its original entrance, that being on Jefferson Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And John and my staff is just a couple of slides to show, and we'll make it quick after that. But is John able to share screen? When the courthouse was built back in the 1800s, the front courtyard of the building fired into the park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They complemented each other. This is obviously not a photo from back then, but the point being is that the the courthouse. And City Hall Park were meant to be together. But in 1982 and you can see this old photo from 1917.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In 1967, this entrance was converted into a loading dock, which is currently full of supplies and dumpsters. The original extravagant Alaskan marble inside the building is preserved. Well, the marble on the original entrance has been damaged or covered in a layer of concrete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very unfortunate and likely would be costly to restore. But that could be done and can be determined in terms of overall priorities for our expenditures. This historic entry way would lead to more foot traffic in the park and less off of Third Avenue, where there's also been so many high profile instances of violence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you can see these things then and now. Images, a lot of reports have been done on this, including from the University of Washington and architects that we could take advantage of and be able to really scrutinize whether public safety and access to the courthouse could be and could be improved by opening this entrance and closing the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one on Third Avenue. John, are there any other photos to show? Apparently not. Okay. So before you this this morning is a striking memo that I developed in collaboration with Councilmember Belge and again, with input from our judges and other staff in the courthouse, it would remove a specific reference to the possibility of developing affordable housing in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this space from the original motion. However, it remains an option that the executive could pursue. But my objective is to make this report as flexible as possible to ensure that most creative ideas are considered. And we must not forget that the problems plaguing our parts are the result of a severe lack of housing inventory.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The striking amendment also requires to plan to address safety and security concerns around the courthouse, including the park. The plan aims to take a holistic look at the problem and provide a recommended course of action, which could include an assessment and analysis of approaches to not only address safety and other concerns, but also recognize that productive discussions'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are ongoing between the executive and the mayor to chance through the park. If that were to happen, the park were transferred, were to be transferred by the end of the year, which could just be a land swap. And from what I've learned, there is a lot of surplus land that we own that could be provided to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city and c r the city of Seattle easily. But if that were to occur with a well received ownership of the park by the end of this year, then of course, that language and the striking amendment would no longer be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would no longer be an effect. I think it's the time to take control of this part and transform it into something that we can all be proud of. And I think we can all envision a day when we hear fewer sirens, sirens, screams, cries, and less about inadequate safety, and instead go back to hearing the sounds of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'birds and music and people laughing and having a good time, even buskers in the park. The main point is we need to do something. I think this makes sense and I believe that will help all of us, the public, the residents around City Hall, Park and the courthouse, the businesses, employees who can go back to work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our employees and above all, for me. Access to justice and all of our common services. And of course, it could be used as part of what we look at long term in the configuration of our common civic campus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sorry went on for so long that this means a lot to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Once a member of Parliament. I think you find it means a lot to many of us. Would you believe I would entertain a motion?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move because motion 2020 10318.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Motion 2021 318 is before US Council member Cole Wells.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to say a few words about my contribution to this. Maybe they've turned itself off. I want to thank Councilmember Cole Wells for being willing to work with me to include some broader thinking about safety in the area generally beyond just City Hall Park, although the focus of this action is on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City Hall Park. And I just want to call attention to some other things that this motion does that I that I advocated for and that I appreciate being included. It asks for us to take a deep look and a quick look at the key factors that have driven the violence and disorder that we've seen around the courthouse'",
        "'speaker_1': ', including prior efforts to address the problem, because there have been some and I believe you always need to start with a good problem definition and some sense of what can be done to address the specific problem before you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The it requires that we come back with a plan to address safety concerns in and around the courthouse, including city hall park, taking a holistic look at this problem and recommending a course of action that could include something like crime prevention through environmental design approaches, which is part of what was going on with the previous activity to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'activate the park. That that's that's part of that kind of thinking that you create safety as opposed to just responding to a lack of safety that we talked about a description of ways in which the county will engage with the city of Seattle to address crime around the area, a plan for relocating any current or potential future'",
        "'speaker_1': 'occupants of an encampment if they if they come back. And as you can see, if you go down to the courthouse, this is the problem with relocation as a as a sole strategy. If all you do is relocate people who are living in tents on the ground, the tents come right back somewhere else because people need to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'live somewhere, that they have nowhere to live. They're going to go someplace else. And many of the tents are now just around the corner under yes or the yes or overpass. So it is a it is only a temporary and it is not a complete solution and in many ways not always a humane solution, but we need'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a more holistic total solution that includes public safety, human resources, smart street activation. An end to COVID would be nice. That would help a lot. And then it goes on to talk about a cost benefit analysis of restoring the original courthouse entrance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I got to tell you, I've been around long enough to have been through a couple of spins through that particular wheel about restoring the main courthouse. It's never made any sense from a financial perspective to me. I'll just say for myself, very expensive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What has what was done to the front of the courthouse was a crime against architecture and humanity and the history. But it was it was a pretty thorough damn job. And and to undo it would be extraordinarily difficult and expensive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I really think we should be we're already bringing up the discussion that we had been having prior to COVID about the future of the campus. So much has changed in our campus started. Let's just start with the fact that it looks like the administration building will not be reoccupied again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If that's the case, then really sort of puts, I think, a fire under the discussions around what is the future of the county seat for our campus. And then finally, if there's an agreement with regard to City Hall Park, an assessment of options for the acquisition, which is what Councilmember Caldwell spoke to in detail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anyway, I just wanted to point out that I really think it's important that we think broadly and that there's a number of different things required in order to create safety for our employees, for people coming to the courthouse, to access justice for jurors, for people who live in the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think this is a good step, and I'm glad that we are willing to think a little bit bigger and broader and come back with a holistic approach to the area. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Mr. Chair as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm very sorry that I did not mention earlier the second sponsor, legislation council member Ragan Dunn. I was going to thank Martha and I thought she would be talking many cheers. But he's been very involved with discussions about public safety in the park ideas and what to do with it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I really appreciate that he's been so supportive. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further discussion on striking amendments to Councilmember Dunn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But thanks and thanks for your kind word. He make me want to vote for Ingenico. Well, because everything you said in your introductory remarks was exactly what I would have said. And it's powerful and it's bipartisan. And yeah, I was proud to propose that first piece of legislation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the confirmation legislation, which I knew probably wouldn't pass but would get the conversation started at a regional level. What were you're going to do with this courthouse to take, to take, to take the people's courthouse back from the lawlessness that had ensnared it and find a compassionate way to get folks into the wraparound services that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they need out there and to be a better solution for everyone. And and then Jeanie took the ball and morphed it from sort of a almost a. Inflammatory attempt to get the dialog started to, I think a more thoughtful piece of legislation that is going to result have a better result which, which I appreciate very much and'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and think there, there really is a way to solve these these problems. I mean, we were talk about $1,000,000,000 into our homeless problem globally since the crisis was declared by the executive in the mayor. And it is now not unreasonable, I think, for folks to start to at least appreciate the need to move the encampments that are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'around our public spaces into the wraparound services the taxpayers are paying for. And City Hall Park is. Is maybe the first leading example of how that process might look into the future. So I wanted to thank you, Nicole Wells and Claudia Valdez, you for their continued leadership on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would just mention that about ten years ago. And Jeannie, this is free information. We have had a lot of one on one meetings in person because we're we're separated. Bob Ferguson and I talked about about ten years ago, he sponsored legislation to reopen the original entrance of the courthouse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, Kathy, you'll remember that you were involved with that, too. And and so I think there may be value in see, it's weird architecture is symbolism in government and you see it in Washington, DC more than anywhere. But you see it our state capitol, capitol buildings across the country and the county seat as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sometimes it's indicative of the long term sustainability of a democracy. I think there's value in architecture and I think there's something to be said about if we are successful in moving individuals from city hall parking to wraparound services and get them the addiction treatment they need, the mental health counseling need, the job training they need, and the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'housing they need. And at the same time, we beautifying City Hall Park and perhaps spend a little money to open up that courthouse entrance. It says something about our ability to solve our community's problems, especially in an area that has been dogging local governments, not just here in King County, but across the west coast of the United'",
        "'speaker_2': 'States, which has about two thirds of America's homeless population. So all that is to say that I want to thank Councilmember Cole Wells and Balducci for their bipartisan leadership in this issue. And I would urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further discussion on it as to. Lambert Council member. Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Well, first I want to say this is really good legislation and thank you to everybody who contributed to it. It is a topic that has come up many, many times over the years and has been followed by promises from the current owner, but unfortunately have not been kept.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so it is a really good idea for us to be able to take this back. One of the problems that we've had is that our queue lines getting into the courthouse have been so wrong. And so if we were able to sneak it into the park so that it wasn't interfering with the main pass through and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we could potentially put an awning so people wouldn't get wet. And there's more space on the Jefferson side to maybe have some more magnetometers to get people into the courthouse more quickly. I really appreciate all the things that were said by the previous speakers, especially on the idea of it's not humane what's happening in that park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And being able to get services is a much better way. Councilmember Banducci was very correct that they did an excellent job of destroying a lot of architecture, which is very unfortunate, but it does tell a story of what was valued at that time and what wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I had the opportunity to go down and travel in that area of the courthouse, which is pretty much been locked out for years. I was surprised by how much space there is down there that I had no idea was that big and what the potential of that is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I know that we have done several reports and yes, they were astronomically expensive, but hopefully there could be some grants. Another state has a courthouse restoration grant program. So I am excited about this. I think cleaning it up has been everybody's goal for a long time and I especially like the extra, whereas it's being put and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know how I got my name added to that, whereas but the one that says that we are very concerned about the safety of our employees since I had an employee injured also so and was at the march and heard and saw many things that were happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for this good piece of legislation and I'm looking forward to voting for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further discussion on striking amendment as to. I reserve my comments for final passage, seeing no further comments, notes to all those in favor of striking amendment as to please signify by saying on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those opposed nay nay. The ayes have it as to is adopted. Is there a title amendment? There is not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, there is the title amendment. Title Amendment one.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Title amendment t one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two, one. As before I see no discussion paper. Please signify B.S. on those opposed. No, the ayes have it. The title amendment is adopted motion 2021 318 as amended and final passage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Question. Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council members on the line.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I heard a few times references to permanent supportive housing, but when I look at the legislation, I see that it references moving people in encampments to temporary housing and shelters. Is there somewhere else in the legislation that I missed that discusses permanent housing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It can answer that. Mr. Chair council members I. In striking amendment as to. Along with temporary shelters, there should be a line that says. Or permanent supportive housing as needed. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think that's a little bit. That language doesn't sit well with me because it still sounds like we could be moving people to temporary housing and shelters, which are not the most effective way of dealing with this situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think anyone disagrees with the fact that we need to have free, clear and clean, accessible parks, that our employees deserve to be safe. The question is whether we address the symptoms of homelessness, the symptoms of homelessness, especially at the expense of the people who are suffering the most from it, which are the people who are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'living in the camps? Or do we address the root causes of it? And to me. Moving people from one bad situation to another. Bad situation is not addressing root causes. And so that that's just one red flag that I wanted to point out that doesn't sit well with me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a member. As a member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, thank you, Mr. Chair, to address that. Thank you. Const members. Hello. On page 15, my mind 56 and 57 that says in cost benefit analysis of concern across line of 54 and 55. Temporary housing and shelters or permanent supportive housing and small.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, these are requests to the executive to come back with options for us as part of particularly what Councilmember Bell she added with me and to the striking amendment to look at the root causes, to look at this whole thing holistically, not just in a simple fashion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's broadly approached and broadly rec, broadly examining what can be done with all that's going on in the park currently, what has been? So I share that concern of yours. I hope that you will look at this holistically and know that affordable housing is needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Period. But if we have people who start camping out in the park individually or forming encampments, we have to get them the services and the help they need so that they can get permanent supportive housing as needed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaking for myself, I'm concerned that legislation like this contributes to a narrative about homelessness so far and dehumanizing to people experiencing homelessness. For instance, I have am concern about the reference to cleaning up in this situation because it doesn't address people in the people with needs and people who are experiencing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd much prefer we use language like addressing issues of. They dehumanizing the legislation like this can lead to does it doesn't acknowledge the need for housing, for treatment for support to make sure that people are successful. The conversation is too centered around public safety and concern around one blot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't even acknowledge the robust efforts led by the Alliance for Puget Sound. The Alliance for Playing Square, which offers a vision for this, the northeast corner of Pioneer Square. They are bringing the city of Seattle County officials, residents, business leaders, other community leaders into a workgroup and visioning what they see for the northeast corner of things'",
        "'speaker_0': 'where it doesn't seem to be acknowledging that as well as significant body work by a leading community partner. I'm here in my district. I think the overall work of this legislation contributes to a false sense of security. When we talk about public safety around within City Hall Park exclusively, particularly as we talk about people coming and going'",
        "'speaker_0': 'from the courthouse, our employees, people coming in to do business with the court jurors. They are not originating their trip from city hall part of the block to the path and the courthouse sit on the trip originates from somewhere else in the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have they travel through pioneers where they travel through downtown Seattle to get to that block. Going to the courthouse with the public safety concerns that exist and are real exist beyond see how park itself and the block the courthouse sits on to engage in a city significant effort around one part at the exclusion of the neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_0': 'around it. I do believe it contributes to a false sense of security. And brings me to my next point. This is inside an incorporated city. Our responsibility is to provide public safety needs in unincorporated Kane County cities, provide public safety within our unincorporated areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If the county has the resources to address public safety needs, I can make it work. Any of those that are needed in unincorporated areas in my district include other, in fact, other neighborhoods within my district. This neighborhood being within my district, for instance, White Center has had at least six firings over the last year and is in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'crisis. Constituents are continuously concerned about road safety and wanting safety improvements for roads in white summer. We don't have the financial resources to address. We don't have the financial resources to address the fire in the way the community would like to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There aren't the resources to address other issues, Anderson, in my district either. And those are just two tiny pockets of unincorporated King County across the entire county where I can delineate and identify places. I would make different expenditures.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we are responsible, unlike, you know, in incompetency. So whether we can acquire relief for a dollar that also doesn't account for the capital and operating costs that would be invested and spent over time again in a city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yes, the courthouse is the county seat is where the courts and the council and the county does its business. I understand what happens if you don't access to justice. So people in the unincorporated Kim County need that same access to justice and justice living in safe, supported, empowered communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is an exchange that I think shortchanges that access to justice in other places in our county. And so I would I will be voting no today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Members ALL Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, I'd second everything that you just said, especially the point about unincorporated King County and our responsibilities there with respect to public safety. Second, I just want to go back to my point about affordable, permanent, supportive housing all around King County, especially in Seattle, whatever, quote, unquote, sweeps are done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People's issue is not the opponents of that. Their issue is not that people are being connected to services and that our our parks are becoming more accessible to other people. The main issue is that we don't have the permanent supportive housing options to connect people to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't understand what is being done here that's different. The issue is that we are in a housing crisis broadly. So if those resources to send people to have existed at the. Abundance and rate that have been needed to solve this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why is focusing on one specific block? Going to change that issue. We are in an overall housing crisis. That is the problem. So to me, this feels like. Codifying a sweep legislation next to where we are, where our building tends to be, whereas people all around King County have been have been crying about this issue for a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'long time. So there's no new revenue attached to this. King County has no progressive revenue options. What are we actually doing here?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But Mr. Chair, I'll just say one one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thing about energy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in acknowledgment of the points that that the former speakers are making. When I first came on the council, we were doing our first biannual budget since I was a council member. We identified homelessness around the county complex as a really key issue that we wanted to do something about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We found some very creative ways to increase a significant amount of funding to support shelter and services around the courthouse, specifically because it is our it is our county seat. We are the county government. This is our neighborhood where we work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we felt a special responsibility to the challenge as it was presenting right here in our front yard. And so everything that both you and council members have said is true and fair.
