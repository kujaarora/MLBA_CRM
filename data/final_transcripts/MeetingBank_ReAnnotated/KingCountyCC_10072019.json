        "'speaker_0': 'Whatever you would like if all four of them would come up as a panel?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. So proposed motion 2019 0339 would confirm the executive's appointment of Lee Eric Moman, who lives in District two as a citizen representative. Mr. Roman's application notes that he has spent the last 11 years of his career focused on managing waste disposal and processing in both the public and private sectors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He currently works for Seattle Public Utilities as a solid waste operations manager. Propose Motion 2019 zero three for one would confirm the executive's appointment of Heather Trim, who lives in District four as a representative from the recycling industry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mrs. Trims application indicates that she is the executive director of Zero Waste Washington, which is an organization that works to reduce waste, improve recycling and remove toxic chemicals from products through policy, advocacy and community program. Motion 2019 0366 would confirm the executive's appointment of Robin Friedman, who lives in District one as a representative from the Solid Waste'",

Mrs. Frieden's resume indicates she has worked for Waste Management since 2011 as a senior communications manager and now is a senior manager for Public Sector Services.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and good afternoon to each of you. I might suggest that you introduce yourself in order. Is Miss Rose introduced you and speak to why you'd like to serve on the Solid Waste Advisory Committee in your background.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'An experience that qualifies you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good afternoon. My name is Lee Moman. I am operations manager for Seattle Public Utilities. I've been in this alloys industry for 12 years. I'm hoping to bring some equity to the group as well. With living in South King County, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've also traveled around the U.S. and I hear what others are doing in the solid waste industry. And with the current contamination rates and the other issues that we're experiencing, either through folks coming to the station or curbside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Having experience working at waste management as well as the collections and the transfer station. I'm hoping to bring some experience and some updates hopefully to the new King County stations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good afternoon. I'm Heather Trim, executive director of Zero Waste Washington. And I'm a straight shooter. And when people ask me where they should, if they're new here, where they should work, I tell them that King County is one of the best places to work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They will learn a lot. There's a lot of cutting edge work being done. And so I'm proud of King County. And our mission is to make trash obsolete in Washington. And it's going to take innovation, it's going to take hard work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I believe that King County is a leader in doing that. So I'm very happy to have the opportunity to potentially join this committee. Hello, I'm Robin Friedman. I work at the Waste Management. I'm in charge of public sector services, and I'm thrilled to be here and honored to be on the committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also live in Seattle and I'm raising a family and this is a very important issue, materials management and creating a more sustainable county and city. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'James Balsam, Teamsters Local 117. I've represented members in the recycle and yard waste lines of business for two years now. I see not only the disposal regulations across the country that were all facing currently, but also, I guess the the things that are our members that are picking up the garbage and waste and that are also usually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'customers of the same companies they work for and the safety and all that they that they're having to go through each day in order to get these lines of business picked up and disposed of properly. And I just feel, you know, having a seat at the table to be able to, you know, speak about the labor piece'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of this as well would be beneficial for not only my members, but for this committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Are there questions of of the panel? Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I have a question for the first gentleman and the third lady and then a question for everybody. Do either of you belong to Swann? I do. You do? Are you going to the conference at the end of the month?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. Dang. Do you belong? Are you going to conference?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do belong. And most likely, my colleague who is closer to Swann and does more work will be there. So would you tell that person? I would love to pick their brain when they get back. I can't go, so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, you won't be there. Okay. So I'll be sure that somebody follows up with you. Thank you. It's one of the solid waste advisory committee of North America. And then the question for all of you is, are landfills going to close in 2028, potentially 2040?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What do you think we should be doing to prepare for that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I think what we have to do is try to figure out how best to get less going into the landfill. Obviously, either be a recycling and then the contamination rate. Trying to figure it out. And I know that now part of what we're doing is if you can't clean it out to throw it out, and I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'think we have to reduce our R use. I know with Amazon and all the boxes and all that people are throwing away. We just got to find a way to reduce it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll ditto that. But there was an article in today's paper about a new enzyme that was discovered originally in Japan and then accidentally improved a better one found in U.K., where the bacteria eat the plastic. And this is going to take, you know, some years to get up to scale.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this actually looks super promising. So the idea of new innovations to help us address these issues is something I think we should embrace. I guess I would piggyback on that. Being part of the private sector and working at Waste Management for over ten years, we're very much an innovative company, the largest recycler and then in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'North America. So I look forward to the opportunity to partner with King County and really develop some of these solutions together in partnership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that a big problem that we face right now is that people aren't educated on what's recyclable or how you recycle. I feel like moving forward, we have to be doing a better job with teaching everybody, not just younger kids or anybody, and how you recycle, but why we do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you can't, you know, put a yogurt container with yogurt still in it and throw it into a container that's got, you know, clean paper like cardboard and expect that that's not going to be contaminated with the levels that are acceptable at this date.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then also moving toward more compostable materials that can actually break down over time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Van Dike Bauer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, folks, for wanting to serve on the advisory board. Many of us have a long memory of 2012 when there was a strike. And I'm curious, given what's happened with the republic in the last 24 hours, if anybody wants to share some thoughts about how things are going in the industry starting out'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that year with the Republic has decided to obviously as many people know, pick it here, even though the issue is an East Coast issue. Is that correct? Yes. There were members from Boston that were in the northwest and they've been across the country just recently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And those workers were facing an employer that at the time their that and I don't know how far I want to get to the politics of this but that were offering less than a living wage for most of these people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My understanding is and they did extend their pickets to this side of the country and our members were not picketing at that point. But there were people that did honor the line at that with those those individuals standing out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't really know what else context to give you other than that. Yeah. Thank you. Robin, you're your your company was directly involved, I think, in 2012.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I was the company spokesperson. I'm trying to forget those days, but I really can't speak to what's going on with Republic. But most importantly, I can speak to that. We don't want to look backwards as a company.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was a painful, difficult time for our community as well as our company and our employees. And as we look forward, I feel very confident that the that our employees will be happy and that we will have solid contracts and we won't see any more strikes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What was the best lesson? Because I know you were the spokesperson at the time and I was involved because of the Regional Policy Committee. What do you think the best lesson was learned for that whole process in 2012?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, just speaking from personal experience, I was in politics in Washington, D.C. for over 20 years before I came here. And I think nobody wins. You know, the company went through a lot during that period of time and as did our drivers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, it's important to have good working relationships with the union. And it was a it was a difficult time for anyone, everyone. So I would say nobody wins. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that maybe the company tried to be more communicative as we went forward after that strike and open up more channels of communication.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would agree with you. I think that we've been working to heal those relationships. We were very close with the union now and we're also thinking farther ahead well before the contract comes up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. The other comment, I would just add, I think communication was very key with with waste match. I also work with Waste Management and King County on kind of both sides. And I think what worked well is honoring the picket line for those for and understanding that there's a two minute wait and just making sure people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'keep level heads and on both sides of the table. And I believe that really helped out during the 2012 strike. Thank you all and thank you for your willingness to serve. And thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome. Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to ask you, in your introductory remarks, you said that I see myself representing equity on the committee. Could you elaborate as to what you meant by that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, living in a South King County and I work at Wallingford and just making sure that the when they build a facility that we don't have such an equitable facilities as we do in South Park versus Wallingford, where Wallingford has a big, gigantic playground.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And South Park, we have there was nothing else built there, no playground, anything for the community, and just wanted to make sure that the community is being heard and that they're offering up at least get trying to get to some community people to see what what they want in the in the facility or need for the facility'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. One issue that's before us that you need to know about and potentially work with the state on is the currently and the unincorporated areas there UTC. The state decides what the rates are going to be for the unincorporated areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So a city council like this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're a colleague.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we are also a city council when we are dealing with the local government. So sitting across the street council can negotiate the rates. We want more recycling, we want more this, we want more of this, we want less that and the negotiate on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We sitting over here a council. We are a regional body at this moment, but we are also a local government body. We do not have the ability to negotiate our contract. We take whatever the contract amount is. And in some places in the county, it's double the price of what their neighbor across the street pays.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is wrong and we need to fix that. So I hope that you will fix that. And while you're fixing that, we also need better garbage cans into the areas where bears are getting in and causing havoc. So those are the two things that aren't being talked about but are really important to the people in this county'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And I agree with you that recycling first, compostable is are second, but not everything is is recyclable and never will be. So we are going to have to get past all preconceived notions and look at the different technologies around the world.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope it's sooner than later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the questions. Discussion. Councilmember Cole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'WELLS Thank you, Mr. Chair. We do have four motions to the last to have technical amendments. So I'm proposing that I propose a solid. I propose the motion be made for two at a time. To Lee Eric Moorman, which would be 2000.'",

Well I'm Councilmember Alhambra. Councilmember off the ground. Councilmember one right there. Mr. Chair. Oh, Mr. Chair, the vote is 19 zero now.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'You, Mr. Chair. We have a technical amendment and that would change the language that was inadvertently included, that identified the appointment term as a partial term when the term expires expiration date and the motion reflects a full term.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Amendment one would correct that era.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Caldwell's has moved adoption amendment one. See no discussion. All those in favor, please say I. I opposed. Nay, the ayes have it. See? No further discussion. Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. By your vote, we've given a do pass recommendation to motion 2019 367 as amended. By an objection, we'll place all four motions on the consent agenda for Council. And with that, that takes us to the Winery Brewery Distillery, Distillery Ordinance and public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Same rules apply for public comment. I will try to stay about three people ahead in calling people to testify. And when it's your turn, if you please step to either one of the two podiums. We I however I take part of that back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will ask you to try to limit your testimony to one minute. We have at present a page and a half of people signed in to testify. The first three people will be Susan Boundary Sanders, Cliff Otis and Chase Killebrew.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good afternoon, counsel. My name is Susan Bounds Sanders. I am commenting today as a private citizen, not in my capacity as one of the city council members. I'd like to thank Carlton over Ball Dutchie for her striker that made so many improvements toward protection of farmland and rural land in King County.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I am here today to ask for more protection. I want to remind you that I've submitted testimony in the past that there is plenty of room inside of city limits for these quintessentially urban activities of tasting rooms and event centers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are over a hundred acres in Woodinville and over 1000 acres altogether in the city surrounding the Sammamish Valley. And I want to ask for improvements that I've given on a single page of testimony to you today, because the ordinance still provides for death by a thousand cuts to rural and agricultural land in the Sammamish Valley through'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and allowing providing an environment for land, speculation, providing loopholes in the code and providing for incremental weakening of the code. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. Council members. My name's Clifford Rosen with MATTHEWS Winery. Winery's tasting rooms in unincorporated Kent County of Work collaborative with you over the past three years to find a legal pathway that both protects rural agriculture and allows small businesses like ours to flourish, providing jobs and a much needed tax revenue to the county.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a result of reviewing this amended ordinance, we have just a few questions that are left. What's the rationale for the percentage of a tasting room to define the percentage of 15%? It's like going into deeper and saying, your kitchen can only be this size.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's kind of a ridiculous structure. That index to parking, we would have about 8 to 17 parking spots. Where are we going to park the cars that come for a wine release? There's so much concern about an EIA statement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why don't we do one? How is the recent hearing examiner's decision for breweries impacting this? Can the state vesting law be preempted for a local vesting ordinance? Can the county require a business license that is tied to alcohol sales legally?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't think so. So we urge you to take the time to forward legislation that's balanced, fair and balanced. And I think you just need to take a little more time with this one. Thanks.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. My name is Chase Killebrew and I am representing Blue Line and land use planning and consulting until Engineering Consulting firm based in Kirkland. We have written a long letter that is included in your packet for today's meeting, but I would like to highlight a couple of the points.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, the parking maximums that have been proposed lean toward redundancy when the proposed code provisions regulating maximum impervious surface, maximum building size and setbacks plus the county surface water standards should be adequate in prohibiting the negative effects of pollution generating impervious surfaces.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, if a parking maximum is considered necessary to ensure a reduction of the potential effects on water quality and runoff of development, one possible solution of reaching a balance would be to add a condition that allows the parking maximum to be exceeded.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If an applicant implements more alleged bbmp stormwater runoff, such as pervious pavers or by retention wells. Second, we ask you consider the Department of Local Services permitting process as this will affect the enforcement of the proposed ordinance, particularly the proposed compliance period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With our extensive knowledge of the deal process, it's pretty lengthy and we know that it will be for these existing facilities coming into compliance. So we appreciate the determination of the Council to guarantee the ordinance can be fairly implemented once approved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Laura Cherry and I'm the owner of Dragon's Head Cider on Passion Island. And I just have a couple of points that I'd like to share with the council today. This ordinance, as written, would have a significant negative impact on the fragile economy on Passion Island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's frustrating that all of the time and money is spent by the county on stakeholder analysis did not include a single resident of Ocean Island. So Councilmember McDermott and his staff have reached out to the community, understand, and drafted a carefully worded amendment that would better meet the needs of the island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's extremely narrow in its focus, but it resolved the issues created by this ordinance for the fashion community. So I'd like to urge the Council to approve the fashion amendment. My second point is, with respect to the broader ordinance, I'd like to emphasize how important it is that the Council finally take action on this ordinance today'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The delays resolving this issue also have severe consequences. As a small business owner, I can't make plans for the future of my business. I can't make additional investments in the growth and expansion of my business. Until you make a decision, we have it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't envy you because it's really there's no great answer here and there's no way to keep all the stakeholders happy. But it's time to own the issue and do what you can to resolve it in a timely manner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So to continue to kick the can down the road would only continue to make more issues. But please vote to approve the ordinance today so that we can all start to make plans for the future again. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good afternoon, friends. My name's Craig Peck. I live in Woodinville. And I urge you to reject the changes to the current law that are essentially an up zone and a repudiation of the compromises that we made decades ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Sammamish River Trail is where I walk, stroll with my wife, exercise and dream. And my kids played soccer and baseball in the Sammamish Valley on land protected from commercial development. It would be a permanent loss to King County's residents if you sacrificed or even risked.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The current balance of beauty, agriculture and built environment to benefit a handful of illegal business owners. And please don't make it possible to open new bars, liquor stores and event sites. While there are plenty of other legal locations for these kind of businesses in the area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Don't reward land speculation. We spent together millions of dollars buying development rights to the Sunny Image Valley to protect it. And it's not just the agricultural feel of the valley that benefits the current hospitality industry there. People are actually growing food in the valley, and I buy my produce 5 minutes from my house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I am Carla Da with MATTHEWS Winery. Whatever ordinances you decide to put in place will greatly impact the community, our friends and our employees restricting hours or minimizing retail space, which subsequently reduces our parking capacity or strangle our business and many others.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The policies you mandate may force us to abandon the incredible property we have developed. For the community to embrace no farm, no flowers, no expansive lawns, for families to play games on or linger on a sunny afternoon. No embracing grazing deer or scurrying covey of quail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please carefully think this through. Let's work together to design a fair and balanced ordinance. Please look at this situation logically and with a local focus. Please take the time to truly evaluate how your decisions will impact our business as so many others.'",

The smallest valley is the first opportunity for young and aspiring farmers to immerse themselves in this vocation while remaining near the cultural attractions of the city and support network networks of their families and affordable housing.'",

My name is Kurt Tong, Homemaker and I farm in the Spanish Valley and we are subject to the development above us because all the water from those implements runs down on our farm.

This was authored by county employees itself and it just doesn't make sense that if such a large area of agricultural and agricultural buffer areas, it should be taken into consideration what the environmental impacts are going to be before an ordinance is even proposed.'",

Not only will food sources be lost, but as a resident of the rural King County area, the proposed ordinance will also negatively impact the quality of our day to day life, reducing open space, allowing increased retail and event operations, threatening water quality and dramatically increasing traffic on rural roadways.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I understand. And you have my sympathy that this affects your business. And I'm sorry you're lumped in here with us, but we are a business as well. We are working to grow and we cannot grow if we have no land to grow.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wineries, tasting event rooms, they don't need the land. And we do. And we can't have access to that land if we can't purchase it. If we can purchase it because we somehow have $1,000,000 to buy a parcel, it doesn't matter if it's severely degraded past the point of being usable and we want to do U-Pick pumpkins next'",
        "'speaker_2': 'year. I would like to think that that's a more family friendly event than wandering around on a lawn in a wine tasting room. That's just me. You have legislation in theory to support your farmland by buying the farm land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Your legislation in theory to support your food insecure constituents. We operate at farmers markets and we utilize the WIC program supplying nutrient dense food grown with organic practices to your constituents. And the fact that there are so many people in this room who have shown up and well shown up to just statistically, we don't want this'",
        "'speaker_2': ', the people who want this or five businesses who directly receive benefits from it. So I don't understand why we keep pushing the issue. I'm not for this ordinance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Michael B, followed by Lamont Alexander.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, Michael Tinsley with the Hollywood Hills Association. First, I want to thank Claudia for stepping into this and making some incremental improvements to what was a very sloppy, messy ordinance that you guys were handed last year by the executive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it did make some incremental improvements, mostly, though, on secondary issues and things that, quite frankly, just followed. The big issues, the primary issues, which are those loopholes that were written in there for what reason? We don't know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I still remain. It has to do with the definitions and that somebody else earlier mentioned. The clear thing in the code now that says only a product made on site can be sold on site. That's fine. It's very clear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's been removed and that should be kept. There's a rich legacy or legacy or a culture in our rural areas that extends all the way across us. And this ordinance is going to affect all of our rural areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's been a lot of talk about farmland and appropriately so it is very important and it's very, very at risk with so many pressures on it. But what many people might not understand is that this agricultural community extends into our rural area in general.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have the county's website. It says 51,000 acres in agricultural production in King County. Of that, 14,000 only are actually under protection, which means only 34% of the farmlands are protected, 66% are not protected there in the rural areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So as this code is written now, is extended to the rural area. It's going to have a massive effect on the whole rural community, which gives a lot of quality of life to not just the rural businesses and the rural citizens, but also to the urban citizens that come out and enjoy this bounty for the very many'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those it reaches to it. So I urge you to support I would like Mr. McDermott's proposals for Vacation Island. We are against Kathy Lambert's amendments proposed for these existing strike, but really we think this should be revisited altogether.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know we all want to get over this hangover from too much wine talk, but this isn't about wine. This is about land speculation. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I can tell you that my community, as well as many of my neighbors and neighboring communities, are unanimously against this particular ordinance. We think that it's unnecessary and in fact, does the wrong thing by rewarding a small handful of speculators.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And but I love that I live next to the rural part. And I took my children last week into the farms, and I talked with the farmers and I talked with one of them about regeneration, farming and putting carbon back into the soil.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that's something that we need to keep in mind with climate change and what we need to do to bring carbon out of the atmosphere. And that's a very important thing that our local farmers are doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I support our local farmers, the farmers market, and I buy from them every week in the summer and I take my children. And so this is why I don't support the proposal. Thank you very much. Hi. My name's Becky.'",

And I've come to every single one of these meetings, usually with a better statement. I wasn't really planning on talking what I which is I want this to stop.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like I can't keep taking time out and coming to these. I mean, I don't live anywhere near here. I live in Woodinville. It takes forever to get here. The parking sucks, as they talked about earlier. I don't get paid to be here either.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just think that. We can't continue just I've heard the term kicking the can down the road. This has to end at some point, right? Like we got to just make a decision and move on. And I'm just hoping that we can do that today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please. Oh, and I'm totally against all of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone else and anyone else to offer testimony. Then we'll close the public hearing. And as we know, the council has been working on this ordinance for more than a year, almost a year and a half. It was first taken up by the Local Services Regional Roads and Bridges Committee.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good afternoon, Aaron. Austin's council staff, Christi Craig from the prosecuting attorney's office is with me, as well as Jenny now from central staff. You have a very large staff report packet here. It includes the striking amendment and the and one title amendment, as well as a red light version of the striker and a summary matrix.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wasn't planning to go through the summary matrix again, but I could take questions on it if anybody has any. So we covered it last time. You also have a separate packet on on the dais that has some green and blue shading in a matrix form.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You also have the thing that you hold up Consumer Gazette is the public comments that were received since the package was distributed? Yep. So I could brief the line amendments or the members could read them themselves, whatever you prefer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Members would be my suggestion that we have briefed the striking Amendment one and the amendments for the most part, follow amendments that were briefed at our last meeting. I'd suggest we take up the ordinance and brief as we take up each amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can't remember up to now. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Do you mind a question on the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Underlying staff report and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Matrix before we get going with that? Please be appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and forgive me, this this may not have a simple answer, but I had heard some conflicting information today that got me questioning my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you talk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About allowable retail uses under the current.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Code in rural agricultural zones?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it required to be grown? Are products required to be manufactured or grown on site?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the current allowance for sale of beer and wine goes under liquor stores. The condition for that requires that it be limited to accessory to a winery or brewery. Isn't separate, but that's what it's intended. And limited to sales of products produced on site and incidental items where the majority of sales are generated from products produced on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With that, I'd entertain a motion. Councilmember Belushi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Chairman. Move. Ordinance 2018 zero two for 1.2 without recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member Belushi is moved that we advance ordinance 2018 241.2 without recommendation Council member Belushi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Move striking amendment as one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Member Belushi's move to striking amendment. S1 Do you wish to speak to it before we take amendments to it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to work through amendments and then speak to it, please. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to move Amendment point five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember Lambert has moved Amendment 2.5. Council Member Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. This amendment increases the amount of building space that can be dedicated to testing activities from 15% to 30%. The limitation on testing space was a new concept introduced a couple of weeks ago, and I think the 15% restriction on testing space is a little aggressive for this concept.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we were going to restrict the taste in space, a business can have without a clear understanding of the impact on the ground. And I think we should have a little bit more space than that. I believe the CAP will accomplish my colleague's stated policy goals while protecting against any unintended consequences.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I urge your support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Discussion of Amendment Further discussion of Amendment point five.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Belge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you speak a little bit to what that means in terms of the square footage limits on building size and then what that would mean for the size of what is this testing and retail areas that the underlying maximum aggregated floor area didn't change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's still 1500 for facility ones, which doesn't allow retail space and so doesn't part of this and 3500 for a facility to use in the area and a zone. And then this would be of that square footage maximum 30% could be dedicated to retail and tasting areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can somebody do the math and tell me what that I'm trying it myself means doing that right now. Okay. I think what I'm coming up with is wrong. And I've been I've learned never to try to do math live here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we do. For a 3500 square foot winery. 15% would be 525 square feet. We make sure that that totally live math and at 30%, they'll be 1050 square feet. Okay. For an 8000 square foot winery brewery distillery, that would be 15% would be 1200 square feet and 30% would be 2400 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember De Mirsky Thank you, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have representatives from the Executive's office here, and I wonder what their position on this amendment is, and I'll ask the same question as we move through this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who. Who from the executive division might be willing to take that question?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think she's upstairs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can. Kelly is upstairs. Miss Wolfe is downstairs. Miss Wolfe is moving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Karen Wolfe with the King County executive's office. We're just looking at this amendment today so we don't have a position on the percentage versus the actual square footage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's one of the most famous.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sharon, do you have a position on the underlying percentage, the 15% in the striking amendment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were supportive of the 15% in the striking amendment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Bell duty.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The 15% was added in the most recent version. I just want to make sure that people understand where this particular issue has been. There was no percentage limitation, if I recall correctly, in the Executive's proposal, square the rest square footage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What worked well was the square. There was no limit. There was no limit. So 15% was something that was introduced only in the most recent striker a few weeks ago. And it was based on, as I understand it, a staff review of some other codes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct? Can somebody speak to me about what? Because I had one understanding about what the 50% was based on, but today I was told something different. So I just want to be clear what it was based on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were asked to look into it and so we did a review of a lot of different jurisdictions. Most of them don't have a percentage associated with an accessory use, or if it does, it's specific to a different type of use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We found that 10 to 20% appeared to be reasonable for an accessory to use and had put in 15% as a potential example of use. I thank you. I just wanted to sort of set some backstage for where this came from and why it was part of my most recent proposal amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And maybe Councilmember Lambert could speak to why 30% makes more sense than 15%, but just to provide context. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So as it came over from the executive and as is currently, there is 100% that you can use in your property. So we went from 100% to 15%, which is a huge difference. So one of the things that that triggers is how many parking spaces you can have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when we looked at the number of parking spaces, it was way too small. And so we looked at what would be a more reasonable amount of parking spaces for that size. Again, as a staff and council member, Balducci said, we have not changed the square footage requirements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have not changed them. And so and we looked at what the trigger would be for parking, and we wanted to make sure that it was reasonable and not more than is current. In fact, it's not more than its current.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's where we came up with the 30. So it came up from the executive at 100 and we're talking about 30 so far left.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I had a question on facility wise and facility. Are they just tasting rooms in unincorporated areas or would they be tasting rooms that exist in the urban part of like Woodinville and where they have the same kind of limitations?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm just trying to see if there's any difference.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the facility one's facility to the facility, these are production facilities. They are allowed in several zones, including the commercial zone. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are allowable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. The requirements for specific production apply like two stages of production. That applies only to the A and ARI zone. Remote tasting rooms as a separate use doesn't require production and that those are proposed to be allowed in the community business, regional business committee, business and regional business zones and then into in one area for in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ARI Zone near Woodinville.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So as a demonstration project. So they are allowed in both the incorporated cities as well as unincorporated areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're allowed in the urban. Unincorporated in the. Rural unincorporated, but we don't regulate inside the cities. So other cities have their own rules for wineries, breweries is Hillary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're talking about it. We're only talking about it. And rural, unincorporated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Area, rural and urban. But yes, just in urban.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But like Skyway that I represent, that's where I am.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the discussion. Councilmember Lambert to close, if you wish.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think that this is a reasonable amount and impacts, as I said, parking, which is an important thing. And so I think this is a reasonable compromise. Thank you. I urge your support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor of amendment point five. Please signify by saying I. I oppose. Nay, the ayes appear to have it. Division has been called for all those in favor of amendment point five. Please raise your hand. All those opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The ayes have it. Point Amendment. Point five is adopted. Councilmember Caldwell's Would you be kind enough on my behalf to move the adoption of the Amendment 1.5, one point to be so moved?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. One point to be is before us. As we heard in testimony today, the legislation that was originally drafted by the executive branch and sent to council addresses issues that were identified and extensively study in the Sammamish Valley.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The similar issues don't exist on Fashion Island yet. As written, this code would apply indiscriminately to Valentine as well. So I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, which would allow existing businesses only on fashion to be exempted from the minimum size, their arterial access, the setback and the square footage limitations to not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'impose the least amount. What I might consider this Mama's Valley solutions are the issues that have been identified in Mama's Valley that don't exist on vacation. So I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment for the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What was the original reason that Bardstown was included? Is it just because it's located? It's considered unincorporated and rural. That it or would that impact that what we're talking about for the Mama's Valley?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. The underlying ordinance covers all of unincorporated King County.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which includes bash on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mm hmm. Seeing no further discussion of those in favor of 1.2 B, please signify by saying I oppose nay. The hosts appear to have it. The ayes have it. Amendment 1.2 B is adopted. Amendment 1.5 B Council Member Col Wells.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you be kind enough to move adoption?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. 1.58.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, no, he skipped over that. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I switched him up the other way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Consistency would be very bad. 1.5 a please council member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move adoption of amendment 1.5. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm amendment council member calls has moved. Adoption of amendment 1.5 a to speak to it. This amendment would set the minimum locks area at two acres, allowing up to 7000 square feet of aggregated floor area and exempts them from the size limitations on retail and tasting sites.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is to apply to in the red zone to winery brewery distillery twos for historic properties. Property is exclusively stored property. I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the amendment. I see no discussion. Council up the Grove.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Do we know this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This this is not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Based on specific, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or are we aware of a current inventory of historic properties?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it just one?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I mean that this would apply to. Yes. Okay. That we know. We know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Mr. Chance, remember. DEMBOSKY So could could somebody explain to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Me the policy rationale for bringing historic works? It feels to me like what we're doing here is looking out for one particular business. What is the policy rationale that this should be of general applicability?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would defer to the sponsor, but I will say that there is code in here now about historic properties, treating them differently in some cases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With the point that Austin's just made about the legislation already addressing historic properties. The the work I barely plan to invest time has a history and part of its history is fruit preserves. And so as we look at wineries and if possible, use for the site, that is the nexus in my bringing the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See no further discussion. All those in favor please signify by saying I oppose nay. The ayes. The ayes have it. Amendment three. Councilmember Dunn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. At this point, move Amendment three and two speak to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Dunn has moved adoption of Amendment three. Councilmember done very.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well. It's important that we recognize the rural areas of the county are very different in nature than the suburban areas, as we heard today. And they certainly require a different approach in regards to the winery code. I'm offering this amendment in order to differentiate between rural for rural areas and other suburban areas throughout the county, which have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'different dynamics to account for. I want to recognize that many people who live in the rural parts of the county that it is important to have these types of event spaces available on some occasions. It's my hope we can preserve this aspect of rural character while also safeguarding rural businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My amendment is narrowly tailored to allow wineries, breweries, distilleries and tasting rooms on very large properties to host private events as part of their business. It makes sure to include certain conditions are mindful of potential impacts in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under this amendment, private ends will be allowed if the following conditions are met. The event must be in the rural areas. On the property on which the event is held must be at least eight acres. Buildings used for events must be set back 150 feet from interior property lines in order to further avoid being seen or heard'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by neighboring properties. The property access must be on a main arterial road. This will avoid impacts to local roads in the rural areas zone and it's consistent with our comprehensive plan policies. In addition, a temporary use permit wouldn't be required as long as the event doesn't include amplified outdoor sound between 8 p.m. and noon the following day'",
        "'speaker_4': '. This time restriction is meant to be considered of the potential impact that any noise could have on neighboring properties. The amendment only applies to existing businesses with production liquor licenses from the state. This will allow current businesses to continue events and only on sites that cause no further impacts to local roads, neighbors and the rural area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All of these conditions ensure rural character is preserved and rural residents will stay at places to hold events. This amendment is consistent with our rural economy, strategies and plan, and it provides opportunities for businesses to supplement their income and stay in business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your consideration of Amendment three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the discussion Councilmember Epigraph. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Similar question for staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How many parcels does this apply to? And we know the ownership.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the properties that have been identified to have existing production facilities or potentially there's five that are over eight acres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member buildings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would not otherwise be eligible for this use. No, they would ask. The exemption could possibly apply to because they're over eight acres. But they without the exemption, these five properties that you're aware of would not be eligible for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They would be subject to the limitation of 24 events per year. Okay. That's in the underlying. And with this amendment, what would be the rule about? There would not be a specific limit on events. ATP wouldn't be required unless there was amplification as stated by Councilmember Dunn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member up there. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And be clear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under current code, not current proposals. These properties are in the rural agricultural zone and therefore their products would need to be grown on site were it not for us changing the rules.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. 60% would need to be grown in Puget Sound counties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Under current code. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seen no discussion. Others in favor of Amendment three please signify by saying I oppose. No. A division has been called for. All those in favor, please raise your hand. Well, I. I believe that's five others opposed for the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kerry's. Count magazines. Help me. You're about to get this one or both. Title.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Title, just T2. But do the striker first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have one as amended before us. Further discussion on this one as amended Councilmember Double duty.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to try real hard not to give a final passage kind of speech because there's more process. I want to start by saying I am definitely feeling both people who said, can we get to the end one way or another, whether this passes, whether nothing passes?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that we have reached the point where we need to move to a decision. Anything that we do with an ordinance, we can change with an ordinance. But I think that just continuing to spin on this topic isn't helping people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A few words. So I think the three principles we all agree on, we agree that we want to preserve and protect the agricultural lands and uses of this county. We agree that rural activities should be appropriate, size and scale and use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We agree that rural owners and and people living in operating in the rural area have property rights and they can operate appropriate businesses and they do in their unincorporated rural areas. And farms are businesses. That was a good point as well as somebody's made.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think what we're disagreeing with is how to balance all these things and sort of what the real on the ground impacts will be of a proposed code. I want to point out that we know what the on the ground impacts are of the current code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can go out there and see it. Part of the reason that this whole issue was taken up was because of the complaints that were coming into King County from people out in the rural areas about what was going on on the ground.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And by the way, also that we were hearing from businesses that they couldn't possibly comply with our code, even if they were trying to comply with our code, because it was impossible to understand. So that was the that was the basis that we began with taking up this code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when I say we, it started with the county executive. He did do a public process out in the Sammamish Valley, focused in the Sammamish Valley. It's correct that this is a county wide code. I'm glad that the Bastion Island Amendment passed because you brought to our attention something that we were having an unanticipated impact for doing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this in the rest of King County. I think that this is better. So thank you for that and for being here today again. But. The challenge we've had and I'm going to read just a little bit, I apologize with your with your indulgence, Mr. Chair, I asked the executive branch to tell us what kinds of problems they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'were having with enforcement, because I have said many times that we haven't enforced the current code, and that is the problem. So I asked them what is going on? Why isn't the code being enforced? And part of its resources?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to say one thing we haven't talked about it here at all is that there is a companion budget proposal which I have brought, and we're going to be taking up the budget, starting in our budget and fiscal management committee tomorrow that will add resources to the Department of Permitting to allow for education and enforcement'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the code, because we can't if we adopt the new code and we don't enforce it really right back here again. But let me just say and some of this I'm taking from from things that have been written to me, and I'm happy to share this with people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So some of the things that we have going on here, the current code doesn't address or define processing requirements for winery and adult beverage businesses. In other words, no production is required on site under current code. So folks who say there should be more than one step, two steps, there should be all steps, no steps currently required'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in order to be legal. If the current code were enforced. Wineries, adult beverage businesses would not be required to conduct any stage of production of their product on site. The state issued liquor licenses without requiring production at the state address for the license.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That happens as well. There's no definition of an event in our current code. So what's an event and how do we actually manage events if we don't have a definition of what an event is? Probably the clearest example of inadequacy in the current code is that we don't know how many of them there are or where they're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'located. If a business is operating as a home, occupation or industry, it doesn't even need a permit. So we don't know where they are. They require a ton of other things, you know, clearing and grading and pervious services and other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they don't require a use permit under current under current rules. So that's why this new proposal, as it came to us from the executive and still contains today a requirement for a business license and establishing some definitions so that we can identify and regulate businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to remind everybody that businesses, even if they're allowed under this code, will still be subject to all other portions of county code, including critical areas, building codes, public health codes, which include septic and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will say that. Yeah. I'm just going to pause there. The current code also doesn't include adequate mitigating provisions for impacts related to traffic, parking, arterial access. Number of guests allowed at events and hours of operation. None of that is in current code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I believe that this code helps us in the sense that it establishes clear parameters. It allows some businesses to continue, but at a smaller scale. And that's what we're hearing from the businesses, that they will be at a smaller scale.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I, I there are and will be businesses in unincorporated King County outside the unincorporated growth boundary. That's just the case. But there should be an appropriate size and scale, and that's what some of the requirements in this code do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will also say that I believe that a large part of the challenge in the Sammamish Valley is development in the city. The city boundaries are such there that there is a a carve out. And if you were drawing the city boundaries today, I'm not sure you would do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That allows a large number of wineries, a growing number of wineries. There's a large new development that's in process right now, as my understanding, in the same general area that has all the same impacts of traffic and people drinking and and pervious surfaces and all of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's in the city boundaries just across the street from where we're talking about. So the majority of this activity is out of our control. So we're trying to set reasonable regulations, a reasonable approach. I mean, I would not be in favor of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would not have proposed it if I thought it was going to lead to a massive expansion of environmentally damaging activities in this area. I do not believe that. I don't. And I know that you all believe it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know you believe it earnestly, but I don't believe it. And so I think this is a very fair and balanced code, and I think we should pass it. But right now, it's being proposed to pass out of this committee without recommendation so that we can get to the next step, which is another 30 day comment'",
        "'speaker_2': 'period. And so you all you don't have to come down to do it, but you can continue emailing us and you can send me the email that says CPA and all of that. Okay. When you when you pass something that's more restrictive, you don't do an environmental analysis because it's more restrictive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're doing environmental analysis when it's less restrictive, when you're allowing more impacts. So that's why there was a determination on significance here. Okay, I'm going to stop now. I would urge my colleagues to move to the next step and to just get to a place where we can have an up or down vote at final council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the discussion, Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to ask Councilman or about duty a question, if I may.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, a bit about duty to yield to a question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here at first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What's your question? Remember Gossett?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. In the book, I was struck by the number of people that said that last speculation is killing farmland and that we are allowing it. But just listening to your explanation a moment ago, you said things like, well, we don't we we don't necessarily have certain kinds of regulations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So someone can start, what, a house or an unincorporated area. Turn it into a tasting room or something. And then that was probably all right. So are you saying that although that might be true globally. We can't necessarily say that every structure out of an unincorporated area that's now facing no more or some other purpose related to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'distilleries and wineries, it's not explicitly that they went out there completely illegal, and the only reason they're there is because we didn't enforce it left in the U.S.. Mark, you were saying it's much more complicated than that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I heard a lot of questions in there. Councilmember, you do my very best. Okay. So with regard to the your your frame of speculation, speculation is a huge problem in the Sandwich Valley and probably elsewhere. I'm most familiar with the Spanish Valley in my district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, as you know, very well represented the city of Bellevue before I came here. And so it was a great surprise to me upon being elected to this position and knowing what I knew from following the issues of the farmland preservation fight of some decades ago, and where and all the different subsequent waves of that soccer fields'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and everything else we've talked about. I was very surprised when people started coming into my office almost right away and rolling out their their big drawings and saying, This is what I would like to do with the property that I own in the Spanish Valley, Arizona.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would look at it and I would say, but you can't do that in the Sammamish Valley and you can't build all those homes. You can't build that giant one. You can't but whatever it was that the person was coming.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think that the lack of clarity in the code and exacerbated by the fact that this has been pending for so long, I mean, it's been with us for a long time, but it's been an under discussion for years that has contributed to speculation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think putting this to bed will be the only thing we can do to help start to quell speculation. But truthfully, land values are just up everywhere. So I think the land values will continue to be up. But I think we are feeding speculation by our failure to act and by the lack of clarity in our code'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the ag zone. And so that would be my answer to your overall question. When you say is it more complicated about violations of code versus the clarity of the code? I think there is a wide spectrum of what's going on out in the world.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there are some places where you have or had owners that just didn't follow. The cop knew it, chose not to follow it, and now are like in this position where when we finally get done, there will have to be some enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know personally of businesses who have tried very, very hard to follow our code. They understood it, they tried to follow it. And they have been actually pointed out of times as good actors and they still can't get themselves permitted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think there's a wide range of good, good and bad actors, if you will, out there in the world. I hope that answers your question, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Bell, as we've just been talking about code enforcement, and that's come up quite a bit, how to what extent do you believe the language of this striking amendment will take care of this issue?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are we still going to have gray areas? Will people likely still be able to disregard the rules and the codes and are or will there be ample enforcement? And I'm sure so. You don't know all of that yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Colwell, I can say that we worked very closely with the Department of Permitting and asked them to review all of our proposals with the lens of can I enforce this? So let's just say, for example, the content product requirement, the 60% of your content has to come from Puget Sound counties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Deeper tells us that that is very hard to enforce because their ability to figure out where the grapes came from that are sitting in the bottles of wine that are on the shelf is limited to none. And so we tried to do things like set numerical targets, certain percentage of floor area to move away from home occupancies'",
        "'speaker_2': 'where they have to do things like determine does that person who points at that can't actually live here? You know, I mean, we're trying to get away from standards that are very hard to enforce. And we tried to get to standards that were objective and easy to enforce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we tried to do that in in working with deeper. And my understanding is that they support the standards in this code. Maybe, I don't know, I'd have to ask them if that's a universal thing. But we tried to get to a place where they felt they could enforce the code with appropriate resources, which, as I said'",
        "'speaker_2': ', are coming with the budget. It's coming to us as part of our budget deliberations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the discussion. All those in favor of striking amendment S1 as amended, please signify by saying I. I oppose me. The ayes have it. That that brings us to. Ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know. Time to teach you a title amendment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Title of the amendment to Councilmember Bell to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Remove teacher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Title amendment two as before. I see no discussion. All those in favor. Please say I oppose nay. The ayes have it. Total Amendment two is adopted. Ordinance 2018 241.2 as amended. Further discussion Council member up the Grove. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think members probably know this, but I understand the motion is to move it out without recommendation. I just wanted the record to reflect that. My willingness to move it out, to vote yes on moving something forth out recommendation is not indicative of necessarily support the underlying ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the discussion. Councilmember Caldwell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Chair, thank you. I also would like to say the same thing as was just said by Councilmember at the Grove. I have some serious reservations about this, but I'm willing to vote for it, to move it forward so that we can try to protect it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. See? Nothing further. Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Bell. Duchin. Councilmember Dombrowski. Councilmember Dunn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council Member Basin II. Council Member Cornwall Council Member Lambert Council Member of the Group. Councilmember one Right. Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, the vote is a nice one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. By your vote, we have advanced ordinance 2018 241.2, as amended out of committee to full council. There is a required advertised hearing. Possible amendments would be submitted to staff to be part. I'm included as part of that advertising.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so with in the advertising period is 30 days once it starts. So letting you know it will not. The regular course of action for a normal ordinance that doesn't require an advertising period would be for it to become come before a full council a week from this coming Wednesday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is not the case. It will be more than 30 days from now in order to gather anything that needs to be advertised as part of the public hearing and then have the 30 day advertising period. So with that, Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wanted to know if there's any part of this we should turn back in so we don't keep killing the same trees or different trees. All of this goes out to recycling thing. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Dombroski. Thank you. Thank was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Chair.'"
