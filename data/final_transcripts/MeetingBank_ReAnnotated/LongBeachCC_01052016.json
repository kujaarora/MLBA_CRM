    "Resolution to Amend the Local Coastal Program per the California Coastal Commission and the General Plan Mobility Element.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Just keep going through the agenda here. We have two hearings tonight, hearing item number one, oath as required. So the city clerk will introduce the item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution amending the local coastal program. Per the California Coastal Commission for Consistency with the adopted mobility element of the General Plan and accept the categorical exemption of 15165 districts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two and three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Steph.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. The staff report will be given by Amy Burdick, our director of development services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Mayor, members of the City Council, as you know, the city adopted its award winning mobility element a couple of years ago because it is a citywide policy document, it is required to go to the Coastal Commission for certification for those aspects of the mobility element that are within the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Coastal Commission staff has asked that the city make some minor revisions to the mobility element to ensure that it is consistent with our adopted local coastal plan. We have presented to you the information in the back on where we would strike out language in the LCP and then add language as well to ensure consistency.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The biggest issue I think that I want to bring to your attention is that the Coastal Commission has asked us to exempt out a map in the mobility element.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As it relates to preferential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Parking districts, because we do have two preferential parking districts in the coastal zone that the Coastal Commission says have not been certified by the Coastal Commission. So we would like to proceed with the changes that have been requested by the Coastal Commission, exempt out the map, showing the preferential parking districts and then submit the revised mobility element'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and the LCP to the Coastal Commission for their eventual certification. I'm happy to answer any specific questions you may have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me close the hearing and take any public comment on this, if there is any. Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very good. You clear? Because the address, just for the record. Where are these specific areas located? Where are the parking districts located?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Rudd, as you know the process is your comment. It's not questions it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wasn't that you haven't indicated where you indicate you're asking for preferential parking spaces. I think the public has a right to know where those are located. That's I don't see that in the plan unless I overlooked it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's also council questions that will be coming up as well. And do you have any other comments?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would hope that you would not pass this unless you put forward so the public knows where the preferential parking districts are. Period. Maybe there's some people that want to be included in that. Maybe there's some people that object to having press residential parking districts and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's see what the impacts are in the neighborhood. You haven't list. There's nothing in. Unless I miss something, I don't see it in the file as to what block it is. Who's going to be blocked out? Who's going to get preferential treatment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Start earning your salaries. Start asking questions. Start putting the details out in the record. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Goodhue. Councilwoman Price, we've got a motion and then it has comments as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I have a couple of questions for Miss Bodak. So the. Preferential parking district. That is in district three. That's in Naples. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, ma'am. It was established in 1988, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the questions we often get and I'm sure a lot of coastal communities deal with this, is we have a lot of residents asking for preferential parking districts in parking impacted areas along the coast. And we're often told or we often advise them that Coastal Commission won't approve such restricted parking along the coast.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But sometimes people will rebut that with by saying, well, what about SEAL Beach or other neighboring cities in the region that have it? Can you speak to that at all in terms of what? When do they allow it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When do they not allow it? How is it that this particular district in Naples was established after Coastal Commission had already been in existence?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It appears.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That this district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Was established and did not seek Coastal Commission authorization. Okay. So I and I can't speak to other coastal cities on how they've gotten their preferential parking districts approved. But we as city staff recognize the two parking districts in the coastal zone as being in existence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Coastal Commission does not recognize those two districts as being in existence. If there were an attempt to establish a new preferential parking district, it would have to go to the Coastal Commission. I do suspect, based on their discussions with us related to this issue, that they would not be supportive of new preferential parking districts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that has to do largely with access.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It does have to do with access. They have a a requirement to encourage access to the coast that does not necessarily take into consideration an individual residential need to have parking in their neighborhood. So they really are two different policy issues that are at odds with each other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for answering those questions. And I will be making a motion at this time to approve the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. There's emotion. Any second. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Dave, any comments? Nope. See no other council questions or comments. Then we will go ahead and take a vote on hearing one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson, a motion carries.'",

Deputy Chief Rich Rocky from our patrol bureau and Commander Paula Barron here is we're here as a team to answer any'",

Our goal with the body worn camera program is to help us enhance community trust and underscore law enforcement legitimacy and accountability by using video to better document police interactions with our community'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Our objectives for deploying the cameras are officer and citizen accountability. Reduce injuries to our officers, reduce citizen complaints, reduce uses of force, and enhance investigations. And what we've seen with the many other departments that we have studied is that these reductions that we're seeking pretty much do occur and in some large percentage numbers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Moving on, a committee was formed in March of 2014 to consider the use of body worn cameras. Objectives of this committee included to research best practices determine the feasibility of body worn cameras, identify the best product, or what we thought was the best product and vendor for our needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Research and develop a policy for body worn use and identify infrastructure concerns. Subcommittees were formed to look at body worn camera policy. We looked at over 20 policies that covered body worn cameras, including best practices from the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Police Executive Research Forum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another subcommittee was looking at equipment. A separate one was looking at legal issues, financial considerations and technology. So as you could see, the subcommittee looked at really all of the issues across the board. The recommendations of the committee have led us to the development of a pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The details of this pilot program will include camera deployment, which is planned for approximately March of 2016. It will take place in the West Patrol Division. We will deploy between 40 and 50 cameras to include patrol officers and supervisors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The financial impact of this pilot program includes your approval to contract contract with Dell Marketing for $210,000. It is being funded by one time, by a one time appropriation allocated to the police department in FY 15 for strategic technology investments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additional equipment may be considered and purchased during the pilot program through alternative funding sources. This contract includes cameras, network components, software applications, cloud storage, training of staff and systems support to interface with existing systems. Although we are asking for $210,000 for this pilot program, we realize that full implementation of a body worn camera program will cost more'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Additional cost are unknown at this time. Additional areas of concern to us include infrastructure, data storage and personnel to handle potential additional workload. In conclusion, there are three things I want to leave you with. One, the body worn camera is a tool.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not the silver bullet. One of the things that we have learned throughout our research is body worn cameras are a tool to help us enhance community trust and underscore law enforcement legitimacy and accountability by using video to better document police interactions with our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Number two, we will not know the full cost of the body worn camera program until the pilot is complete. And three and final. Just a reminder to everybody, because we're getting a lot of questions from many, is that this is a pilot program and we will learn a lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will document everything. And there will be many changes and adjustments as we move along. And and we're ready to do that as as the year wears on. So with that mayor and members of the city council, this concludes my report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I can answer any questions that you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Chief. I will have a couple council questions. So let me go through those and I'll close by making some comments as well. There's a there is a motion in a second. So I may start with the maker of the motion, which is Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to I want to just say that how proud I am at our city, our mayor, our police department and our peo way for stepping forth and and taking this on, testing this this is utilizing new technology to encourage 21st century policing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that these things are concerned, controversial in this day and age, and particularly in our time. I know that this is uncharted territory with respect to the fiscal impact and what the ramifications might be in terms of our public records and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm really proud to say that this wasn't a fight. This was done, you know, in partnership. And it will be it will be treated as such as a partnership. I know that this is I do have just a couple questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that we are starting with about 50 units being deployed. And I think that's a start that's smart just to start small.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Really measure it. So my first question is, what are the metrics? What are we going to how are we going to evaluate success or how are we going to track this thing? Councilman Richards. The four primary areas that we're looking at is reducing injuries to officers, reducing citizen complaints and uses of force in all of the research'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we did for the last year. We were looking at numbers in reductions in some of those areas that ranged between 60% all the way up to 80%. We're looking forward to seeing if that automatically or I should say, as a year goes on, if that will impact our numbers as significantly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's why we picked the West Division to do this, is because historically that is one of the busier parts of town where these areas, these numbers are typically higher. So we will have the cameras issued to officers that will stay with them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They will not be rotated around. They will stay with these officers throughout the duration of that year. And then we'll be able to analyze what the numbers were in the beginning, to what the numbers were at the end, compare them, analyze them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that will be part of a report that we will be turning in at the end of the pilot program to see if it was if it's something that we want to continue with, if it's something that we as a city want to invest money into, certainly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would I would just ask. So it's I'm glad to hear that there will be a report back to city council before the decision was made to. I see there's two one year extensions but the report will come the city council would it would that come in a two from four paper report?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you going to come to city council and and give a presentation? I think it would be good if the council just knew whether the pilot will be eliminated or extended and had the opportunity to weigh in before before that decision is made.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So how would that work? We know we're going to be putting a report together in what fashion? We haven't discussed it to that length. I have to discuss that with the city manager's office and see how we can best present the information that has been gathered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another part I have not mentioned is we are working with Cal State, Long Beach, and although we have not solidified exactly how we're going to do this, we are talking to their academics and we're working together to figure out how they can help us with the report in analyzing all the information that I've just put forth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think that makes a lot of sense to work with an academic institution. So I would just I know that. So I know that this is a one year pilot. We only funded it for one year, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. Okay. So one way or the other, it would have to come to city council for funding if we extend the pilot anyway. That's correct. Okay. Thank you so much and good luck. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Price. May the second. Any comments?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do. Just briefly. Thank you very much, Chief, for the presentation. And this was an item that we had a report on at our public safety meeting, and Commander LeBaron and Deputy Chief Rockey did an excellent job at the presentation at committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A couple of issues that were raised at committee that I kind of want to follow up on. One, to see if we've made any progress on in terms of identifying these issues in the future. And two, because I think they're their subjects of of general interest in regards to this item is because the costs are unknown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And given our budget projections for the next few years, what efforts are we taking to determine whether grant moneys are available for us to be able to implement this technology on either a broader scale or continue using it at the scale that the pilot is going to encompass?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are consistently looking for any funding opportunities that would assist us in this program. Maura, who said it to my left her shop is is consistently looking at them. And what we have to make sure as we move forward is that we're looking for these opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in a lot of what we've seen thus far, there's a lot of strings attached to them of things that they are mandating us to do if we take that money. So we have to be very cautious as we're proceeding forward to make sure that we're not putting the city in a place that they can't get out'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of two or three years from now, depending on our financial situation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have we identified? A process regarding when and under what circumstances footage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would be released.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Under the pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we have. That was part of our policy discussion. And and we have a policy that's going to work through this pilot program. And basically, when you have a criminal investigation, we can't release video when we're dealing with a criminal investigation or an administrative investigation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what we do, in fact, see is that we will follow the public records request act policy that we have. And if it fits under that criteria, working with the city attorney's office, we will be able to release the video.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How are we planning on transferring this footage to either the city prosecutor or the district attorney's office in terms of discovery? What is that done through the cloud or disks? How is it done?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to let Commander LeBaron answer that that question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Price at.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This point, we're not completely finalized.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On that, but we are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Working with the district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Attorney up in Los Angeles, as well as our local district attorney's office, to establish a sharing option.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the software allows us to create a license, which we could share that information with them directly through the cloud.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that when Commander LeBaron talked to the Public Safety Committee regarding this, we had some questions about the mounting options. I know that was one of the pluses of this company. Have you had an opportunity, Commander, since our discussion, to find out if we have any other mounting options that would allow for better placement in terms'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of evidence collection? Depending on the size or the height of the officer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Price, member of City Council. We have looked at that. This particular device will be in a sleeve, in a uniform shirt or a vest. We are looking more at a, you know, uniform shirt option with all of the tech technologies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They all have some limitations as to what they will capture and what they will not capture based on the positioning. This one does capture quite a bit of the scene as it is placed on the the uniform shirt.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Consumer prices that I'm just checking off my notes. Sorry. Have we determined what the fee is going to be for our uploads to the cloud? Any specific figures that we've associated with this for the pilot so that we can start thinking about future costs associated with this technology?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Price, the quote that was prepared for us includes 43 terabytes of storage space. There was no fee on the monthly basis or per upload basis, but that total was provided to us by the vendor. Okay. Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Sorry, Councilmember Gringo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mayor. My concern is always with pilot projects, is that we should have more than adequate time to do it in one year. And now I understand that it's going to be coming back to the council at the end of one year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is will we be emboldened? In Boulder. We hold it to this company should we decide that the data we've gotten thus far isn't sufficient to make a decision as to whether we want to go full fledged with this program or not?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would hope that if it goes back to the Council for reconsideration and should we decide not to proceed with their full fledged program, that we can go out again and solicit another vendor? Because my concern is, is that I don't see extending pilot programs to the same entity if the if the data is not there to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'proceed with a full fledged program. So is that part of the the thinking that we're going to have for the next go around if we were to decide to extend the pilot program to another year?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will be doing a full evaluation of how the provider or the company responds to us. After all, we are their customer. Our standards are high. We will have very high expectations of them, and they're expected to perform.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if they don't perform, there's other vendors out there. So they know that. We've we've we've talked to them and they're. They understand that full well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I would I would hope that I'm going to be in favor of this. However, I would with the caveat that when it does come back to us in one year, that we take all our options into consideration for additional vendors if necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I just want to a follow up question on one of my colleague's questions. I think that you've answered a lot of what we had, and I appreciate the presentation, Chief. In my experiences when going into a home, there are certain calls where family members are in vulnerable positions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And while the Public Records Act is vitally important. Victim rights are also pretty important to me. And I was hoping that you could communicate a little bit about that process and at what times we have discretion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Victim rights are an absolute priority to us. When we're talking about praise or when we release videos, if we're dealing with situations such as crimes involving children, sexual assault and things of that nature. Those are videos that are situations and videos that are very sensitive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will not be releasing those within the policy that we have. It also talks of situations where, for example, if an officer's in an emergency room when they can record and when they can't. The policy is pretty strict about those type of situations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, because this is a pilot program and as we have studied many other departments, we have seen and heard about some of their failures. So we're trying to avoid those pitfalls. And I'm very confident in what the committee came up with and the policy that we've put together that that it's going to be pretty darn good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in regards to actually very good in regards to protecting and respecting victims rights.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that, Chief. I appreciate the process that was first followed to get to this point. I know that there are departments all over the country that are looking at this, and I'm really proud of the methods that you went through in ensuring that we had a very high input, high understanding process.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I first want to commend a police department in our way and all of the community members that were involved in this, because I think it's we've done things a little bit differently, like we often do here in Long Beach is, you know, we were rolling out a program, but we're really involving the community at large'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And so I want to thank you all for doing that. I know you worked with CCJ and a few other community groups to get it right. A few questions I have. So I think you answered my question. I'm glad to see that this pilot program will be started in the West Division for those various reasons.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As far as are we comparing? I have I mean, I know we've looked at other cities, but is there another city that we're looking at a little bit more closely that has done things that we'd like to do?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know if there's a specific component or a specific city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we've we've looked at several cities, including in in California. We looked at Oakland, we looked at Modesto, we looked at San Diego. We've been paying a whole lot of attention to what the cities of Los Angeles or LAPD is doing, L.A. County sheriffs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, we've seen some of the things that are working and some of the things that aren't working. And I think that's the advantage. And when I started my report and I thanked all of you for your patience, there were other cities that jumped the gun.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They were, I think, more interested in headlines than they were in substance and actually looking at what can solve a problem. And I think a big part of our success thus far is that we've been able to take a step back and and look at what other people are doing and then figure out how to move forward'",

You know, first of all, I think the chief and his staff there, because the fact that, you know, I think I understand that this video recording and the police, you know, action is enriching the county and it's good for the you know, for our police officers also, because I think this is the direction in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'which, you know, they're going. And we see a lot of improvements in it, you know, not only for our police department, but we have community also. And I still think that we need that, you know, the track, the cars to see how much we you know, we can, you know, to be sure that it is affordable so'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we can move forward citywide. Because I heard the chiefs said there's a certain amount, but it could cost more. So I think that's why I think it's important that we maybe, you know, we should do some tracking of it to find out, you know, the cost of this because it could be excessive.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But, you know, they are intensive public records requested by many cities. They're receiving from body camera footage. So I'd like to make sure that we are ahead of all of this. And I want to thank you guys for the hard work you've done.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Mean, this has been a project that we've all been working on for probably about a year just to get this pilot project ready. And I want to reinforce something that the chief said is that this is about getting this right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's getting it it's getting it done the right way. We're going to pilot this in a way that really maximizes the success of the program. And we're really proud of the fact that we're rolling this down a way that's responsible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's going to ensure that our rank and file employees were a part of the process. In fact, something that wasn't mentioned by the chief. But our police officers union and the police department had multiple committees assigned just to this project that have been meeting over the course of a year to prepare for for this vote and for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this rollout of this pilot program. So it's been an extensive conversation. This is a national conversation that's going on. And I want to thank all the rank and file members that participated in this. It's our expectation that we roll out the best the best body camera program in the country, and that we do it in a way'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that's respectful to the officers that are wearing the cameras. But it also is of protects the public and that we're ensuring that we're being as transparent as possible. And so I think all of that is what's happening as part of this program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to thank the chief and the team for doing that. Let me do public comment on this before we go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. My name's Gary Shelton. I just. I have no objections to this at all. I'm. I'm anticipating that it's going to pass with. With flying colors, and that's a good thing. I wanted to underscore some points that were made in response to questions, particularly from Councilmember Price and Mongo in regard to the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well, it boiled down to the problem that this is going to solve.

        "'speaker_4': 'police and citizen altercation of some kind. How we would get that information. And so body cameras were to were thought up in the general public as a way that that information would be brought to us.

        "'speaker_4': 'case that might be underway, would require either the city's deciding to release the the information, the videos, or through a public records request, which may or may not be a successful way to get that out there.

        "'speaker_4': '. The police department, I count those folks over there in uniform as friends as well as you folks here at the dais. But it's going to take the continued vigilance of the community to be certain that we know on a in a real time basis what has occurred.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When police force is used and the body cam in Los Angeles is going to be used as a tool for the officer to assist him in writing his report. And beyond that, I don't know what they're going to do with it there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I wonder if that that wasn't mentioned as a primary use for the body cam footage in Long Beach, but that's what they're planning to do in Los Angeles. So any other information you might be able to impart or elicit from the staff would be so much appreciated.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'An average price is $50 a month. Los Angeles is playing well with something that's $85 a month. There's all kinds of prices. $50 a month. Service to the cloud would be a reasonable price for 50 cameras. That would be $30,000 a year for 50 cameras.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Currently we are working on our photograph collection.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this request is to expand that to include periodicals, newspapers and other items that we might lose if we do not move in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, sir, that is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Now, I just heard Councilmember Gonzalez just brought up the the Civic Center efforts as well. Is there a possibility of just basically. Not who is it? Grandfather and grandmother in in this project with that one instead of having somebody separate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Councilmember Urunga, as I understand the request, it's simply to bring back some information and do some study of what this would cost. So we'd be happy to do that, and then we'd be able to provide some information about whether and when to, you know, when to actually do that type of work, whether we should be doing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it as part of a larger overall effort or separately, and what the cost is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, the only reason I'm bringing this up is that, you know, I see a better use of those moneys instead of using a consultant to go ahead and digitize documents that need to be digitized. I mean, why are we going to spend money on a study, another study to come back with a study of a report when'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we can just go ahead and proceed to start digitizing those documents that we need to digitize, especially those that that McWilliams can determine are high priority in regards to their potential loss if we don't do it at a sooner time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we agree we wouldn't be spending money on this study at all on this item that's in front of us. This is just to gather information will be providing options of how to do exactly that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I guess you're not getting my point. Is it just the study? I mean, how about using a much more constructively about just go ahead and use that money to digitize. That's basically what I'm saying is why are we going out to contract?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To study how much it's going to cost. When we're already spending the costs that could be used towards digitizing. That's basically what I'm saying. I mean, you know, I just I'm just trying to get a handle on spending money where we really don't need to, where we could spend that money already towards the effort that we want'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to accomplish in the first place. That's basically where Matt. I guess it's a rhetorical question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But let me maybe add to that just a little bit. No, I appreciate that, Councilmember. I think looking at the bottom line, which is good, I think what the makers of the motion are also trying to get to is that this is an incredibly large and complex project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a lot of of materials and opportunities to digitize that part of the collection. And so I think we really need someone to take a kind of professional approach and review and see what's there and then prioritize those options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilman Price Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We actually included that in there in consultation with the library, because a lot of this material has some legal and copyright issues and things that we need expertize and identifying what can be digitized, what should be digitized, how that interacts with our city website.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we don't have the resources, that is my understanding, in-house, to be to have that type of expertize. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. We'll need some assistance with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongeau.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I might also add to that that there are a lot of grants out there that are available. Once we assess what our need is, we'll be in a better position to go after some of those grants. And then, as many are aware, this year, the Library Foundation did an excellent job in fundraising and they improved upon prior'",

And what was happening here a hundred years ago in 1916. In fact, on January 11th, the city council voted to extend overtime payment for all city employees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself since I couldn't say all that I wanted to in 3 minutes. I sent you an email last week outlining my thoughts, and I hope you've read it. And in September, I also sent an email listing my concerns about the collection.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the email included two lists. The needs have already been identified. List one included unique, one of a kind Long Beach newspapers. I'm sorry, Glenda. It was not the press telegram that's already been digitized, and these have been crumbling for years in the periodicals department.'",

So for future his book Story INS, they're going to need that information if we're going to continue to have an on going role in the history of not only Long Beach, but Vallejo, Southern California and the nation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, in the emails I stressed the need for identifying, preserving and allowing access to local resources currently in the cities. And please note I mentioned city not libraries collection, and perhaps something not realized by people in City Hall is that the collection houses city documents going back over 100 years, as well as the local newspapers and newsletters'",

And during my stint as head of the library's literature and History Department, which oversaw the Long Beach collection, I made sure that once a year a memo went out to all city departments, telling them that anything that they were considering discarding should be offered to the city's history collection.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what an amazing treasure trove of city information that others thought useless ended up being preserved in the Long Beach collection.

        "'speaker_2': 'As far as our internal investigation. What we identified as the cause of the Long Beach outages was improper operation and insufficient management oversight of the Long Beach network system. While the system had been very reliable since the mid 1950s, we did see it and in hindsight looking at it that there were a few mis operations and missed'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We have gone through also and improve the mapping of all of our network equipment, our cabling. We found that that's very important also that over time we had made some slight changes to that and our mapping was not up to speed with exactly what the conditions were in the field.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have enhanced the automation of the network equipment for this equipment to now communicate with us remotely and inform us of the status. And we have a dedicated staff now looking at the status of the network. Every day we've developed that network modeling capability.'",

We identified and we appreciate the feedback from the city staff and the city officials was insufficient communication and interaction upfront with critical stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are making improvements to ensure that we do have a more robust response to situations like this, whether they were to occur within Long Beach or within other parts of our service territory. I've already mentioned the lack of federal protocols in the operation of the network.'",

Some of that goes to the way our systems reported out to us, the condition here in the in the city that night of July 15th. We have addressed that so that we have a clear understanding of the complexity of the incident.'",

One is enhancing our incident response and stakeholder communication. Again, your feedback to us has been very valuable here.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Long Beach area, but all the people that support day to day work and life here in downtown Long Beach and making sure that we are interfacing appropriately with all of those local agencies. So in conclusion, I just want to reiterate that we're deeply disappointed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We apologize. And we do accept full responsibility for the extent and duration of the outages. We're committed to providing that safe, reliable and affordable power to our customers. We take that responsibility very seriously and we take your feedback and improvement recommendations very seriously.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We have learned quite a bit from being able to to use some of their experts who had experience in the city of New York and some of the other major metropolitan areas with problems that they've experienced on their network.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, one bullet that I wanted to point out is this partnering with our Electric Power Research Institute. While that may sound a little subtle, what I want to point out there is that there are a number of municipalities across the country that have these, what I'll call a smaller network configuration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there have been problems on those networks. We certainly don't use that as any kind of justification for the problem here. But we're able to take a look at the corrective action plans that they put together as a result of their issues and compare ours to theirs and make sure that ours is as robust and appropriate in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'making sure that we address all the appropriate problems and issues that that we encountered here. We continue to improve our restoration protocols for critical and significant events and provide ongoing training to to our staff to make sure that that they're able to interact effectively, not just with customers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, as I mentioned, with with all the local agencies, we will work to complete the balance of the corrective actions. And then we'll also do an effectiveness review six months from now to ensure that these actions have all been completed effectively and that the internalization of these actions has been built into our system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, again, apologize for the for the inconvenience of the outages. We do take full responsibility and it is certainly our issue to address. And with that, I'll pause and see if there's any questions from members of the city council.'",

And I and we can't forget or gloss over the fact that it affected a lot of people, both their income, their health, their livelihood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It affected our operations. It was a financial impact to the city, to businesses, to conventions. And most importantly, it took a toll on people's emotionally to have to not have power for days and days and days. And not having information is difficult, especially for seniors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For those that need special support or have special needs. And we've talked about all of that. And so the fact that you guys took that responsibility, I think is important. It doesn't change the fact that what we went through was was difficult and not something that we ever expect to go through again or want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do appreciate that. I know that we've been able to resolve some of our financial questions with the city. And so I think that is a positive step in the right direction where I think we still have some challenges.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think you've begun to address some of those and I've mentioned these is all of these next steps I think are expected, and we're we're expecting those to happen. You know, two things that I think are important is one, I think your SC is aware that there is a community confidence breakdown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, there is a lack of confidence, I think both from myself, personally, the body, but the community. And I think the community needs to rebuild that trust over time. It's not going to happen overnight. And I think that it's incumbent upon Edison to go out into the community and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Communicate, engage, be present at community functions. And so I think that presence needs to increase. I think we need to be able to answer questions. We get questions all the time from the community about what's happening or what the next step is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, as you know, we're not the utility. And so we try to answer what we can. But I think you guys having a presence in the community is really important. And I will again double down on what I mentioned before, which is the communication piece, which I thought was a complete failure during the crisis, needs'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to be strengthened. And it sounds like you're aware of that. You know, the fact that I think myself and others were for some folks, the main form of getting information through through Twitter or through email is not acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, that's something that's your guys job to get information out to everybody. And we should be there to provide support, to provide emergency response. But we don't know what's happening every single minute. And I think and so I'm glad to hear that that's something you guys are addressing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. So I do appreciate that. And I think that that's a really important step. The communication and the community confidence building are two things that are really important moving forward. And I'll just add also that I think these two reports are important, and I appreciate the kind of introspection that's happened in the company.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach is your largest client. So we know we this is a relationship that is critical for our both sides. And I think that we we're also as you know, we expect the last staff the the the PSC report should be out, from what I understand, in the next couple of months, first part of this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. West or Mr. Sanchez, do we know when that will be out?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have a date, but we are expecting it to, you know, hopefully in the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I mean, I've been it's been communicated to me that it would be the first part of this year. And so I think we expect that. And I think it's important to to have all the pieces of both the internal review and the state review to put together a full picture of kind of what happened and then'",
        "'speaker_0': 'what the appropriate response is. And so thank you for coming and giving this report to the council and answering the tough questions. And I think there will be additional questions once we get the PSC report as well. And it's important to answer those honestly with the public and to be out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we await that. There is a let me let me get the most in and the second for the and file, which is Councilwoman Gonzales and Councilman Andrews. And turn this over to Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. So I, too, want to thank you all for being here as well. I know it was a tough time for us in the summer, and I just really do appreciate the fact that you're here. You're apologizing not to this body, but just to the public, because we did have to answer to them quite frequently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I will I don't intend to belabor the issue, but I will. It's communication, communication, communication as much as possible. And I think we've all learned a lesson in that. You know, we learn from these instances crisis is are never expected.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's certainly something that we we just learn from move on and then we go from there and hopefully better the process. And so I will continue to say that now I in speaking with your government relations team who is great, I know that they had talked about additional precautions, especially for our seniors or those with special'",
        "'speaker_6': 'needs, finding a list to identify where they're at. So there's not you know, I know while we're going through this issue, it was, you know, contacting public safety, letting them know who was where. And so do we have are you currently conducting like an identification process to know where people are, especially those with higher risk health needs'",
        "'speaker_2': '? Yes, ma'am. We are we do keep a list of folks that have medical necessity for electrical power. And we continue to look at that process and ways that we can improve that process. We are also looking at better ways that we can, in each of our municipalities, identify senior centers and other places that may be high priority'",
        "'speaker_2': 'items for us or high priority locations as far as being able to provide some communication. So that was some of the recommendations coming from the Davey's report. And we're absolutely looking at them great.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Especially those that are in the high rise buildings. It's hard to get down for them or, you know, they have elevator access, no elevator access after the power's out. So that's great to hear. And then lastly, I know many of our residents, you know, the first district, I think was hit the hardest, I'm sure is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, and as far as customer service, I know there were a few residents that contacted our office specifically about contacting customer service, and they were my neighbors who lived in my building. We were all affected, but they had mentioned that they, the customer service did not you know, they talked about their power outage and customer service'",
        "'speaker_6': 'did not identify them as being a power outage resident. And so frustrated quite a few residents in getting their reimbursements or getting their food checks for food that had been spoiled, especially for some seniors. So I know some of them had been pretty swift and quick, but there were others that didn't get that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't know how that information is being relayed to your customer service, but I would just leave that as another point to think about, because we did get a few comments related to that. Otherwise, again, I want to thank you for being here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you. I also would like to commend you and your crew for coming in tonight and accepting this responsibility. But I don't think we need to be labor on, you know, what is happening and how we're going to take care of it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because you guys came up here to let us know that you are taking a very serious, you know, look at this. And I really believe that whatever has happened, these things will be able to be solved in the future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't know why it was so prevalent in my district because I never got one call. So evidently you guys must be looking over the six district because we didn't get any outage. So could be God, it could be your group.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I want to thank you for it and just keep up the good work, all the other complaints that's on them. I'm not complaining. I just want to thank you guys. Look.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not touching anyone. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmembers Hooper.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I'd like to thank you for the report tonight and being here. And I find the report incredibly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Revealing and very useful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'll just speak about downtown for now. I think the common thinking was there was a hardware issue or an old city. It's an old network. There were probably some hardware issues involved. But your analysis here says, no, it's human error, it's management processes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So to me, that's I don't think we can guarantee it's kind of a wakeup call that that this was the cause, not something else. But what worries me about that is that's the type of thing that can devolve over the years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can get a system in place now, and if management changes and whatnot, you're back to square one. So I'm a little concerned about that. Secondly, and I'm kind of I'd like to be a forward thinking person and we have a new civic center going in here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The first thing I believe we need to get straight is that we're going to have power to that civic center. And considering you're you're not dealing with an existing structure anymore, is there any process, are there any processes in place or any kind of, you know, reassurances you can give us that you're going back to square one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and trying to work on the network to supply power to the whole area? Yeah. Thank you for your question. We have we were already looking at the new civic center and we have several considerations that we're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we currently don't see any issue with with being able to provide safe, reliable, affordable service to the to the new civic center. You know, that that facility can be both on the network as well as off the network.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's one of the things that we're looking at. And we will be talking with with the appropriate members of the city staff about our current plans right now would be to not have it on the network. But again, that's something that we can be speaking with the city staff about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we we have no particular loading issues on the network. We don't have any particular overload issues here in the Long Beach area. Again, it was human mistakes that occurred over time that led to the outages. So it's our commitment to make sure that those things don't occur again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Richard. I'm sorry, customer. You all done? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And no pun intended, but I'm still in the dark on the last. Last time you came. I asked about that lay down yard just along the 17, and it was supposed to be temporary, but it's going like four years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you guys said you would get back to us and let us know what the status is or how long it's going to be there. So I still want to know that. And then and in case you didn't know, there's a power outage right now in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are very well aware of all the outages that occur in Long Beach and are prepared to talk about those. I'll also share with you that tonight we are seeing issues across our system. Okay. Right now we've got about 10,000 of our 5 million customers out, primarily due to the wind and rain associated with the storm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we are very closely monitoring all those outages and including the Long Beach outages. So you think we can maybe have a conversation about that later on? Yes, sir, we will. We will absolutely follow up with you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mangum.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for being here. Over the last several weeks, I've had discussions with the new representative, that is our government relations individual from Southern California Edison. And as you said, there have been communication challenges. Our office has provided opportunities for Southern California Edison to participate in community events.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the initial response from the staff member was, I'll get you information to hand out. And I think that that's not our expectation. I think we were very clear about that. It's been a week and we'd very much like to hear a positive response that you'll be participating in the upcoming community events in February.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's critical that our community has that face to face contact that the mayor and I feel very strongly about. And so our office will follow up again tomorrow and we hope to hear that positive response, because this is this is an opportunity we're providing the constituents, all of them in a gathered area for you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're doing a direct mailing to the community about the event and what I had expected to hear from a company that has turned their their thinking around would have been. Absolutely. Yes. Thank you so much for bringing constituents together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let us seize this opportunity to engage with the community. So I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you for your feedback.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Seeing no other council questions at this time. Public comment, please. Thank you. If you're public comment, please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Larry. Good. You click as the address. Let me begin with a positive comment. And quite frankly, it's the only positive, constructive observation I've had in dealing with community efforts in the Southern California Edison. And that was back in 1995 when a community effort went forward to update and to put in complete operation the six flagpoles that line'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the Marine Stadium. And it was a great community effort between the residents growing community and the ship Chandlers and so forth. And Southern California Edison stepped up and provided the one of their poles. They no longer use Metropoles, which is the base we have for our flagpole in the at the Rowing Center.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But beyond that, the conduct of Southern California Edison, in my view, has been directly repugnant to what a good corporation should be. For almost ten years now, we've been trying to get information relative to what was originally just a small electrical pad in a light in Marina Vista Park, which the Planning Commission recognizes were ugly and had'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to get out of there. And for the past eight years have been trying to get a straight answer out of the corporate office, and they've essentially given the community the little finger they need to that $82 billion corporation of what or whatever it is, needs to get their act together and haul ass out of that park and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'find an appropriate place to put that equipment. I think there's been an unauthorized or at least the community wasn't aware of it. It looks if you go there now looking and based upon the information that City Light and Power and other contractors have said, it looks as if somebody is trying to establish a sister city relationship with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Schenectady. There's so much power in there and we can't get a straight answer at a Southern California Edison that needs to be moved. And it's particularly important for two reasons. Number one, it's right in the middle of a search path for Emerson Army.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But number two, we need that space. There will be the open channel within a year created and so us. So they need to find a location of their own. One other thing they can confirm or deny, but it was my understanding from the former resident association in Belmont Shore had indicated that Southern California Edison was fined the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'largest fine in the state for lying about customer falsifying customer service reports as a result. So so their higher management could get bigger bonuses. I don't know if that's true, but I'd like them to tell us tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's true. Thank you. And also find a place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At times atmosphere. Can you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Find a place to put that transformer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Pardon me. It's Gary Shelton again. Appreciate the report we received from Mr. Dietrich. I appreciate the pointed questions from my council member, Lena Gonzales. Thank you for that very much. The item is talking about the root cause, and we heard what the root cause is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I really appreciate what Council Member Supernova had to say because it dovetailed with what I was thinking all along and listening for, but did not hear in Mr. Dietrich's report, which. Well, I'll start by saying maybe we've had the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maybe you've had the experience I've had, particularly as a kid years ago, where if the waffle iron was on and the microwave was on, I wasn't a kid when we had microwaves, but the waffle iron in, let's say the stove was on and somebody pushed down the toaster and the circuit would blow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, that was the cause of the circuit blowing. The root cause, I suppose we could say, was improper operation and management of the system. But I think what you're going to be asked tomorrow by your constituents is what happened?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we didn't hear that. Did something melt? Did something overheat? Did something cause gases to blow up? I live about a hundred feet from where the first manhole cover flew in the air and was leaving under yellow tape to go to your city meeting with police, telling us, watch out, you got to go that way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's other manhole covers going up into the air. Something was going on besides improper operation and management of the system. I came here tonight and sat through a lot of meeting, hoping to hear what that was. If it was a simple connection that twisted, or if it was something that that melted or if it was something that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'snapped. I think we deserve to know that also. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Alex. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Tom Stout I'm just curious. Business Journal has all this development that's going on down here, which is a lot, and it's going to put a lot of stress on the system that we have. If it did, the system couldn't support what we have, and I don't buy that at all.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Management. I mean, a lot of it is, you know, there's in it management every place, even in this city. So the bottom line is, if we can't support the infrastructure for the what we have in the city now, when you add hundreds, if not thousands of new drawers by having more rooms, condos and such.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How are you going to assure us that you're not going to continue to overload the system? I mean, I happened to be out of town when it went out in Wrigley, so that didn't really affect me. Nothing was damaged or everything worked fine when I returned.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But, you know, these continued out is that there's more to do than just bad management. That's a part of it. But, you know, lack of training, poor quality of workmanship, all have been pointed out in various ways. But I'm really concerned that all this development is going to overload a system that's not adequate already.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How's that going to be addressed? It wasn't mentioned that any of the meetings about City Hall or the development, it's you know, nobody seemed to really be concerned. But if you were in one of the parts of town that has a power failure and I don't remember any sitting having has many power failures as long each day'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Maybe there are, but there sure not any around here that we know of. So I'm concerned and I think a lot of people are. What's going to happen when all this other stuff comes online? We need some answers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other public comment on this item? Okay. Seeing seeing none. And again, this is a continuing conversation and certainly not the end of this conversation. I know that staff has been in a lot of contact with the team and that continues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and Mr. West, I expect that when the PUC report comes out, you would come back to counsel and that we'd get a presentation on that as well. Okay. Thank you. There's a motion and a second on this.'",
