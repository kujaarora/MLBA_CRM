        "'speaker_1': 'This hearing involves a recommendation from the city attorney to take three actions. First is to declare an ordinance, read the first time, and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for final reading of amendments to the Municipal Code pertaining to the Downtown Entertainment and Dining District, as well as the definition of a nightclub'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And then second, to rescind council resolution number six, 0003 and 14 0030 relating to the former ordinance. And then the third action is to adopt a resolution directing the Director of Development Services to submit the amendment of Title 21 to the California Coastal Commission for finding of conformance with the local coastal plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. West, your next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. This is I'm going to turn this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Over to Amy Burdick, the development services director.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At this time, Mr. Mayor and members of the city council, I'm going to ask Amy Weaver to give this staff report and then Rachel Turner and I can answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council. Pursuant to the action of the City Council on December 2nd, 2014, amendments to the Long Beach Municipal Code Titles five and 21 have been prepared and are now submitted for your approval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Since one of the amendments is to the zoning code, they are required to be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Considered in a hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposed amendment to Title five incorporates changes to the downtown dining and entertainment district permitting process recommended by the Downtown Task Force. The regulations will now be included in the municipal code for ease of reference. Formerly, the ordinance set forth the regulations in two Council resolutions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposed amendment supersedes and replaces these resolutions, and it is therefore requested that those be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Rescinded in order to avoid confusion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposed amendment to Title 21 provides a definition of nightclub, which was previously not included in the zoning code. The Planning Commission considered and approved this amendment at its meeting on November 20th, 2014.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In addition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is requested that the attached resolution be adopted, forwarding the citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Amendment to the zoning regulations affecting the coastal zone to the California Coastal Commission as required by state law. If you have any questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are available to answer them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We do have a motion on the floor about Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank the staff for the work that they've done on this round of the dining and entertainment district item. I don't see Mr. Harrison here, but Reggie Harrison, who is our deputy city manager, took up this issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Miss Burdick, remind me, is it eight years? Ten years, when all the while a while. So his twins were much younger. My son was probably two, and I remember walking into the upstairs of one of the establishments where Reggie was holding the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I bring that up firstly because I want to thank you, Reggie, for the work that you did. You were quite a diplomat in that room. Those were not fun days. Those were days when people were very upset that the city was looking to regulate dining and entertainment districts in any way possible.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because I think the approach and attitude was for as long as it made money, it should be good for the city. We learned a very long time ago that just making money was not good enough for the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It did not provide a balance that our residents deserved. And so Reggie was the arbiter of that diplomacy. And I want to thank you for that. That has been carried through. I learned a lot from how you manage those rooms and those tough crowds.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I wish there was a better way to approach these sorts of policies, because it seems not possible to make someone better off without making someone worse off. But what we have done in these ten years is we brought the public into the process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We brought the task force members. We created a task force over a year ago. We established a one year moratorium on Type 48 licenses known as the bars, and that was done in August of 2013. Our original intent was simply to update the ordinance in such a way to encourage good actors and discourage bad actors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that has been accomplished. We had people that came together in a room that in other circumstances would not come to the kind of agreement that they did. And they did come to an agreement. They looked at the recommendations that staff and my office came up with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They worked very hard to vet these recommendations. And the city attorneys already mentioned the key recommendation that I think perhaps took the longest time was the definition of nightclub. How do you define a nightclub? You have residents who have their own definition of nightclub.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You have businesses that have their own. And certainly the city attorney and and his team had their opinions. But we have come to a consensus and it's very important it truly is important to have created that certainty. We've operated under an ordinance that didn't provide as much certainty as it should have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that's what we do today, is after this decades long process of watching the evolution of the downtown, watching the renaissance of the downtown, what we have created is certainty. And I think the residents for that, if it wasn't for residents that moved into Pine Avenue, created really a neighborhood sense.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We wouldn't have this discussion or even initiated the discussion over a decade ago. And so with all that said, I'm very happy for the outcome and the recommendations I know we discussed quite a bit and discussed is putting it lightly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'How to define ambient sound. I look at Rachel, she smiles kind of cautiously about that because ambient music is something that a lot of our establishments depend on, but its definition was vague at best and we have provided some certainty there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so with all that, I'd like to thank the task force members. I know they were here last month, council members. You'll recall this item came before us last month and it was received very positively. You recognize many of the restaurant owners that participated and the restaurant and the residents that participated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so my my gratitude to these members, the community, as well as city staff, many people applied to be on this task force. But I think at the end of the day, people were very confident at the members who did serve and felt.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They were representative, representative of their interests and really the balance between business and residents. We are trying to create a three shift downtown, which is 24 hours. And in doing so, this is a critical piece to our step forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These recommendations do strike a compromise between the business and residential communities. While most of the dining and entertainment district venues exist in the downtown shared by Councilmember Gonzalez and me, I do know that we have many of these establishments throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So for all the pain that the downtown has gone through, I'm thankful that the entire city will benefit. And as I mentioned before, this ordinance will make our application much more predictable. Actually, our city attorney mentioned it for new businesses, more flexible for current operators and more responsive to residents looking for enforcement of bad operators.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So with that, Mr. Mayor, I know we have three motions I'd like to. Are we taking them up? One at a time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Mason, we do all three in one motion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or I can do them separately. It's your pleasure, Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry. We can take all three up at the same time, but we do need separate boats.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So then would you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Make the most of all three?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We could go ahead and read that, actually. Do you want to do that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I thought we would do public comment for all three.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Is there any public comment for the hearing? CNN by Samir Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to go ahead and declare the following ordinance, read the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for a final reading amending Long Beach Municipal Code Section 5.72.200 relating to the regulation of the Downtown Entertainment and Dining District that it was a dining and entertainment district'",
        "'speaker_9': ', but may be adding Long Beach Municipal Code Section 2115. .1855 relating to the definition of nightclub so moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay there's a second by Councilman Richardson. And I have a procedural question real quick. Mr. Mays, because on the on the voting caste system, members are able to obviously second emotion. And they don't have to verbalize it. So on a second do I if I just say the motion that that covers it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Who seconded it on per who who plugged in first. Or do I need to call on them for them to actually second it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Since I'm new to the system too, I think if you see it there, I don't think you necessarily have to call them. They've indicated that. They've said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'll just announce it was. Yes. Okay. Okay. So I have a motion from Vice Mayor Lowenthal and a second from Councilman Richardson. Well, okay. Well, the first the first motion was actually see of mind has Richardson and then Gonzales did the second one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in that way, you have Mr. Clarke. Yeah, I have Richardson. Correct. Yeah, it's it's Richardson. That's right. That's what it it's it says. Okay so the motions by Vice Marie Lowenthal. The second is by Councilman Richardson. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, I think the confusion again that I am.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Confused.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that on the bottom motion. So at the top it is motion to approve recommendation. It is long thought. Richardson then below and black. It says Lowenthal Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the next motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right? That one have been verbalized.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I may have struck that second motion too quickly. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think we're going to build on Lowenthal Richardson, which was the first motion. So all those in favor for the first item, please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries eight votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then we're going to go on to the second part.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Which is the second motion which I'd like to make, is to rescind council, city council resolution numbers, resolution dash zero six, dash 0003 and resolution dash 14, dash 0030 relating to the former ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the second was by Councilwoman Gonzales.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'in their fundraising. It's an opportunity for us to give back to the community that elected us by not using our own office accounts to do that. And like I say, and specifically me, I have no access to that account whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not getting paid, and I can't use the office to pay for anything other than what I can do myself personally through my officeholder kind of candidate. The other thing you mentioned in regards to changing our focus, the focus is our focus.'",

If I were to do that, if I were to start changing my focus into solely fundraising so that I could do these other things, then I'm in here for the wrong reason'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So I don't take your criticism lightly in that respect. I do respect it, but I don't you know, it's it's something that I think we have to put our emphasis on. What are we here for? And if we're here to serve our communities, we need to be given.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Greer it. We have to have the tools for us to do that. And one of those tools is by having an office holder account that will provide us the avenue and the means by which to help our constituents in our non-profits around the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other one last item that was brought up, and that's about, you know, being more susceptible to special interests through fundraising. Again, that that that's up to the that's up to the candidate. That's up to the elected official as to who and what they they go after and what they accept.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's a it's an issue that is personal to every candidate and to every elected official and how they spend those moneys.

        "'speaker_13': 'Thanks. So I think that the committee's done great work. And I don't want I don't want to justify the need for tremendous need that's really in our community. I think most folks understand the needs of their Viera, their respective communities were elected to represent.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think that our council and our communities, our city has come through a difficult time over recent years. I remember when council offices were hit with $20,000 budget cuts consecutive consecutive years, staff was diminished from six to 5 to 4, some offices three.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And a lot of the expectations that were that our community has, based on previous experience in terms of civic engagement parades and our community involvement in community groups, in nonprofits, we've had to pass that off to the private sector.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is a direct. We cut our budgets, but we didn't live, lift our raise our ability to raise those private dollars. So I think that this is appropriate. Now, that said, I do have a few questions for the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Just what I know that we're raising the limits today, but is it appropriate for us to talk about raising contribution limits is going to be more difficult to raise the higher number with the same low contribution level.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That isn't currently been discussed yet, but it would be.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I believe that is correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That said, I would want to offer a friendly that. So it's 500 for both, right?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, currently it's a 500 and then I believe 754 for City, which I don't.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It's, it's five or 750. It's one of the two.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah, I believe it's five. Um, based on the research I follow what the commission, what the committee did. My understanding is that it's 500 across the board. I'd like to offer a friendly to the maker of the motion to change the contribution limits for council members from 500 to 750 and change for citywide.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So mayor, city attorney, so on and so forth from 500 to 1000. And then I. Last time this came to the council, I expressed I think if limits are going to raise, they should be the ratio should maintain be consistent.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So if we're going to triple citywide elected officials limit, we should triple the city council limit as well. So that would take us to 30,000. So would you be agreeable to those friendlies?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure, I'd be agreeable to that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just to repeat the motion on the floor is to raise officeholder limits to for council 2000 for city wide to 75,000 and to raise the level of contribution for council to 750 and for city wide to 1000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the motion on the floor. Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To me. Thank you, Mayor. What I'd really like to see at this point, I'd really like to thank Counsel Gonzales and the Elected Oversight Committee, you know, for the work that they put into this item. And I, like I said, I see it every day, especially with the district my size and what I'm dealing with every day'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And it's really been an asset to us. But I think this is a great, great item that you brought to the floor. And and I think this will, you know, definitely be good for all of us and the changes you plan on putting together.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'There was a time not to suggest that we should go back to this time, but council members had a discretionary fund that was allocated to them. I think several of us remember this. This was Mr. Mayor's laughing. It was $100,000, I believe, if I'm not mistaken.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that was utilized to support organizations, nonprofits, schools, very good causes. And given our budget crisis, that just was not possible anymore. And so what we did is we looked to our officeholder accounts to. Compensate for the loss in that in that amount.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But there was no compensation. It was not one for one what we were able to do with $100,000 a year. We now try to do with 1/10 of that, and it wasn't a 10,000 all the time. That was just a recent change as well, and I hope no council member feels pressured to fundraise.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think what this also allows is for those of us who don't have the personal financial means to send ourselves to various events, and I think of the key events which are rightfully fundraisers on their own. Sometimes we get.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Com tickets, but really our staff should be there. Our staff is the one that does all the work. And so to send three staff members can cost up to $750 to do so. And these are the things that we use our officeholder accounts for is one to support these nonprofits also the schools.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A lot of our schools in our neighborhood, some of our neighborhoods don't have the strong PTA fundraising capacity that some of the other schools do. And that's just a fact of life. And so a lot of us try to make up for that difference, make up for that fundraising difference in the small amounts we're able to contribute'",
        "'speaker_9': 'through our office holder account. So I cherish this. I don't look at it as a campaign expense. I don't look at it as a way to campaign. But really, for those of you who are out there working hard in your communities to be able to do so by recognizing the neighborhood leaders and their efforts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so it's not that different from schools that have PTA that have strong fundraising arms. It is really to supplement what the school district is able to do. I view it in the same way, and I thank Councilmember Price for her questions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They they do raise some issues. We don't want the focus to shift, but the focus won't shift. I know each individual on this council and I'm very clear about what each of your focus is, and it really is in your public service.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But you also acknowledge that you want to recognize the stakeholders and partners that are working with you and support them in their efforts. So for that, I'm thankful to you, Councilmember Gonzalez, for the hard work. Your committee and I support this motion, including the friendly amendment.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Concern, Austin.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, a council member or Vice Mayor Lowenthal, you said, took just about every word out of my mouth here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I read your mind.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I believe if handled responsibly, these officeholder accounts allow us as council members to have a greater opportunity to serve our communities. It's no secret this isn't done in the dark, that the contributions that we would receive for these officeholders account are part of a very transparent process, that it's open, it's full disclosure to the public.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's our option to raise money or not raise money for this for or for these for officeholder accounts are currently raise money for my officeholder account once a year, and I forget about it after that. And whatever we do, we're able to serve to serve our community better with an optional pot of money to work with.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I can assure you, Councilmember Price, and I can assure the entire city as a lobbyist, my focus will not change. Whether or not this passes are not going to be focused on doing a good work in my district and for the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think it's very important for us to realize and recognize that Long Beach is a big city, too. It's full of great neighborhoods. It's full of a lot of different issues. We have a lot of different community organizations and they are constantly making request of us as kids city council members to help.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Can you help us fundraise? Can you help buy a ticket to our fundraiser? Can you sponsor a few children to go to camp? And we do that a lot, oftentimes out of our own pockets or with the limited resources that we are allowed to raise outside of our city budgets.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so raising these these this limit actually what I think what will help us in our ability to serve our communities, and I will support this along with the friendly amendment as well. And I want to thank the Elections Committee for for doing this great work.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And I think fundraising is a vital component to what we do. I mean, like Councilmember Austin said, it's not something that we take very lightly. It's it's certainly a very vital component, especially with the city of our size.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so many of us do give back and will continue to give back, and we do so through these officeholder accounts. And so thank you for the friendly amendment, and I'd like to go forward and vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And finally, we have Councilwoman Price. I'm gonna go to a vote.'",

I do want to I want to especially thank Councilman Richardson, because you do point out something that's first of all, thank you for your very respectful response, because I think we should have a body where we can express concerns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And just to be clear, I didn't criticize anyone. Councilmember Muranga said that with respect to my criticism, I wasn't criticizing anyone or any philosophy. I was just asking questions and raising some concerns. I have no doubt that everybody on this present body is always going to do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No issues whatsoever. My concern is we set policy moving forward and the decisions we make today stay with this body. Long after that, we are gone. So. Understanding that different districts have different needs and different concerns. I appreciate the thoughtful comments that were made.'",

However, both of the two historic districts in Belmont Heights, as well as Long Beach Heritage, have asked that the council review the proposed fees associated with the new ordinance for Landmarking and Mills Act applications. As proposed, the historic landmark application fee is over $900 to apply for the Mills Act.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The cost is 1100 dollars per unit. On the face of it. Those costs don't look too terrible. And we recognize that Development Services seeks to pay for staff time by attributing fees. That's practical. However, these same fees may hamper the embrace of these tools by the very communities they are intending to help.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In particular, single family homes and commercial properties must be identified as historic landmarks before they are eligible for the Mills Act. These two processes alone will cost over $2,000 for the property owner, with no guarantee the property will attain either status.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Please consider reworking this section with either a partial return of fees or a pre-approval process before much time and money is invested. In addition, because staff time could be streamlined, a combo fee for applying for both of these could be preferred.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The 1100 dollars fee for the Mills Act application is per unit. Right now, this is particularly onerous for owners of apartment homes as they cannot charge their tenants for the fee on each unit. Please consider reworking this cost, especially given that staff would only be working with one owner.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One application. As a benchmark, local cities such as Pasadena, San Clemente and Los Angeles all use much lower fee structures to incentivize participation. So in closing, we know that a city like ours with numerous historic landmarks and numerous property owners using tax savings to restore their unique buildings, is a city filled with rich architecture, conscientious owners and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a close knit, functioning city of neighborhoods. These are the very attributes that attract good business a creative class of residents and families seeking healthy, clean communities. Incentives such as those that we are discussing, go a long way to achieving these goals.'",

And I was speaking on behalf of the board of directors of California Heights, its residents, and also as a member of the board of Long Beach Heritage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's been a long time coming. The reinstatement of the Mills Act, it was initially suspended in 2006. That was the last time a contract had been approved. We applaud the fact that the city is moving in this direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The existing contracts have been reviewed and we're pushing towards reinstatement. I also have concerns about the fees as the previous ordinance was written. If you were a contributing property in a historic district, you could apply for a Mills Act contract with a new proposal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Every home or building that applies for the Mills Out contract must also be listed as a landmark in the city of Long Beach. This basically almost doubles the fee for anybody who lives in a historic district. A lot of residents in our historic district, California Heights and the 16 other historic districts try to apply.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The program was suspended and they have been patiently waiting for upwards of eight years for it to come back. And I think the fee structure needs to be investigated, it needs to be reviewed and comparisons to Los Angeles, Pasadena for either a sliding fee scale, maybe a smaller initial application.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then if you are able to achieve landmark status, move into the Mills Act. But as the previous speaker stated, to have upwards of $2,000 in fees paid upfront with no option of any refund is very discouraging to people in the historic districts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would encourage the support of the Mills Act. I would like to see a little bit of fine tuning of the fee structure and how it's positioned and also to speak to comparisons to the city of Anaheim.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city of Anaheim, currently as of 2014, has 286 mills that contracts. Long Beach has 34. So we have a lot of catching up to do to be basically relative to cities of a similar size and population. Thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Dunn. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very good as the address. I would strongly disagree with the previous speaker. I think. Ole, ole, ole helms can remain very, very attractive and are an asset to the neighborhood. As I stated last week, when we were looking at the new design of the city, what's projected for the city hall, in my view, that's not ugly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are some people that like that type of style. But. There's also homes that are I recognize that are homes that are modern style different than older homes. But I think one of the biggest assets this city has is its architectural diversity, and particularly the historic the older buildings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They add character to it. Right now, you want as I said last week or two weeks ago. What you're now proposing. I just. I know I don't want to get off too much in a tangent, but the modern buildings you're proposing here look nothing more than it's a duplicate of Parker Center downtown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to whatever extent you have the capacity to help restore. Some of the of any old, older building. I think it's is an asset and it's money well spent in this city should concentrate on that and help people do that in any way they can.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'It's been a long time coming. And so thank you for just being open and being able to answer a lot of our questions regarding regarding the Mills Act. I just wanted to clarify, though, you did say that you would bring back information on a masterpiece schedule and information regarding whether we can combine or reduce some fees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, ma'am, that's correct. The master fee schedule is scheduled to come back sometime in March, and we would look to get an item on there where we can do a combined fee because we do need to keep the fees separate right now because we do have existing landmarks in the city that are not do not have Mills'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Act contracts. So we still do need to keep the fees separate. We've looked at our fee schedule for what they are now and then we do incorporate full cost recovery. So I'm not able to recommend at this point any reduction in those fees without asking for a subsidy from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I will be coming back to you with the master fee schedule update with a combination fee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, great. And I know that there had been some talk about the reduction in the general fund, about 100 and something thousand dollars. But was there a projected projected revenue from this at all? And I mean, can we even foresee what that might be?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There really isn't.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Revenue per say that is generated to the city. I think it might enhance the the value of the property and we might recoup some of that. We spent a lot of time talking to the L.A. County assessor on how they handled Mills Act contracts countywide.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the the contracts are really negligible in terms of of what they will affect the general fund on. This is a worst case scenario that we provided you up to $200,000 a year if we were to able to to process all of these contracts within the first five years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I don't think that the hit to the general fund is really going to be anything that's negligible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not significant at all, which is good. Okay. And the participation from the highways and we discuss that a little bit. I had asked you about that. And can you just touch on that a little bit more just so we can get a clear picture of how that may look?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct. Right now, we have three units, three buildings that have multiple units in them. And not all of those buildings, not all of the units within those buildings participate. It makes that extremely difficult for the highway.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it sets up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Inequity between the individual unit owners. We would like to give priority to those buildings as well that have partial or a partial compliance. And we would recommend as part of this that going forward that 100% of the units in a multi-unit building must participate with the involvement of the HRA.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The individual tax benefit will still derive to the individual unit owner, but the ATO is typically going to be the one that's going to be implementing building wide improvements, such as replacing windows or painting or repointing the brick.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it really is beneficial to have the H-2A involved and act as the agent to all the individual unit owners.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Mongo. Councilmember Price. Sorry. Councilmember Mongo.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And I apologize. I misspoke. I was talking to the mayor while you were answering the vice mayor question. So I don't know if you answered this, but one of the speakers raised what I thought was a good point about what happens if someone doesn't qualify.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you address that? If you have already, I apologize, but I didn't hear it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did not address that answer. But that's typically something that we work through. Even on regular applications, there is an ability for the city to refund processing fees up to a certain percent if it's going to be a failed application.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We typically do not like to bring failed applications forward. It creates an environment of negativity for both the city and for the business or the property owner. So if we have reached a point in the process where we thought that a Mills Act contract would not be viable or that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Landmarking would not be viable, we would stop that process and really.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ask them if they wanted to relieve themselves of the process and then they would be eligible for a partial refund. But we have standard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Procedures for doing that in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The municipal code. So those were just apply here as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know I reached out to you, it was either very late last night or early this morning. I'm not sure about I'm not sure either. It may have been sometime after midnight, but my my question was about the fees in particular.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And again, I apologize if you've answered it, but as you've explained it to me, this is purely a cost recovery fee, correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We do have current fees for both the Mills Act and the landmarking. We would ask.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That those remain as is because it is pure cost.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Recovery. But I did suggest that we could come back with a combination fee for new applications and we would come back as part of the master fee schedule update in a couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what what do you envision the combination fee? What would you envision included in that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We would I can't tell you what that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Fee would be without doing the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We literally estimate the entire process and how much staff time it would take to go through the entire process. But since it would be essentially two processes and a lot of the information is very similar in terms of the program of improvements that they're going to be making and the background research of the building and whether it'",
        "'speaker_9': 'would qualify as a landmark. There's a lot of overlap in that research and that's where we can do the fee reduction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In terms of that fee not knowing what it's going to be. Is it is it fair to assume that that, too, is going to be purely a cost recovery?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't offer any other fees except for cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're not allowed to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're not in a position at this at this point to be able to absorb the costs associated with that in our current budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is correct. We we have to do cost recovery or I would have to ask for a subsidy from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absent a subsidy from the general fund, is there any other way for this program to go forward?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just the fees that are charged? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a very long thought to have it queued up once more. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I actually took a pass while I was in your seat. So I wanted to just ask a question myself. I think this may have been addressed, but please remind me one of the original concerns regarding reinstating the Mills Act program was the ability to confirm what residents were doing, what type of work that they were doing, and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'how their tax reductions were spent, whether on restoring or maintaining the restored property. And so you I trust that you're confident that with the reintroduction of the new program, you will have an opportunity and able staff to monitor those property investments?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, ma'am. We've learned quite a lot from doing the reviews of the existing contracts, and we've also learned what makes a good contract and the documentation that's required. So a new applicant would be required to provide us with a program of reinvestment into the property.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we would suggest that the majority of the time those improvements are going to be to the exterior of a building and not in the interior. The value of the mills art contract is that that it should be restoring things that are viewed by the public or within the public realm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so, you know, a landmark building that has a publicly accessible lobby that is also called out in the landmarking ordinance for that building, they could clearly qualify and use the Mills Act subsidy to make investments in that public lobby.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But if it was a private unit with private improvements on the interior, the value of that for an exchange for the public subsidy is is clearly diminished. So when the owner comes forward and they show us and document the value of the improvements that they intend to make, that is actually part of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the contract allows us to do an annual inspection if we so choose. The state law does require us to do it periodically, and so we are required to do that periodically now under recent revisions to state law.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that's something that we must do. Thank you and I appreciate that. I wanted to share that. I'm very pleased to see this program return. I know the hiatus was quite lengthy and and I appreciate the staff work that's gone into bringing us back this program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In this iteration, our office receives inquiries about the Mills Act on a regular basis, which isn't too surprising given the number of historic districts and high rises in District two. I appreciate the input that we have from members of the historic preservation community, such as John Thomas and Anna maria McGowan and the individuals who came to speak'",
        "'speaker_9': 'before us today. Thank you to each of you that has been here, and I know you've been here through the entire process. What we might lose in the immediate tax revenue at the city level, which we had our staff identify a few moments ago, I know that we'll certainly gain this in community and corridor character and ultimately'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And I think this reinstating this program will help us restore that and be able to tell that narrative from our streetscape. One of the interesting things about our city that's different from I think other cities is a lot of our home frontages they do front out into the street scape in a way that other cities don't as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'openly. We're sort of that that inside out as opposed to the other way and you have a lot of alcoves and and nooks and other cities where you don't see the character of the homes as as quickly as you do in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Long Beach is different that way. I don't know that we're specifically unique, but in driving through other major cities, I do notice that that's a difference here. And so to be able to allow residents to tap into this when possible in order to restore and and ensure that we we preserve the character of our architecture, it's'",
        "'speaker_9': 'important. So I'm really appreciative of the inclusion of of the nonresidential or commercial buildings in the program under a certain threshold. I think that's very important. There are many historic commercial buildings that contribute to our city's historic fabric.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And given all the hard work that we put into our adaptive reuse policy, which took us a few years to bring online, we know that the city's commercial building may end up being tomorrow's residential building. And so I'm very grateful for that, that we have the foresight working with the stakeholders to see that and be able to'",
