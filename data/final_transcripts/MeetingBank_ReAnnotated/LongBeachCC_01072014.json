    "Resolution to Approve the 2013-2021 Housing Element and Certify the Negative Declaration.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor Foster. Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution approving the 2013 to 2021 housing element as a part of the city's general plan and authorize it submittal to the State Department of Housing and Community Development and authorize the Director of Building and Services to submit the adopted'",
        "'speaker_2': 'housing element to the California Coastal Commission for finding of conformance with the Certified Local Coastal Program and certify the negative NEG negative declaration in d0313.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This work?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Mayor. Members of the Council. This process has been underway for about a year with multiple hearings before the Planning Commission and Amy Bodak will provide the staff report on this particular item. There have been a number of changes and revisions to the document since it was first released, and that's the result of a lot of public'",
        "'speaker_5': 'input. The OECD and the various entities that weigh in on these kinds of actions. So we're very pleased to present you a housing element that, in fact has been approved by the state. And Amy Bodak will go through the details and the process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council, thank you for your time tonight. Related to the housing element, some of which you will see tonight, is a recap of where we were in December. However, I am going to present to you some changes since December that have been made to the housing element and talk to you in general'",
        "'speaker_8': 'about the process and clearly the need for the housing element. As you probably recall, the housing element is one of seven mandated elements within the state of California. It requires a review by the State Department of Housing and Community Development that a review process is required to occur before the City Council takes action to adopt a housing'",
        "'speaker_8': 'element. The state law does require periodic updates to the housing element. This is slightly different from other general plan updates, but we are in the process of updating our housing element for the fifth cycle, which would be for the period of time from 2013 to 2021.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Part of the housing element certification process is getting a finding of substantial compliance from the State Department of Housing and Community Development. This is an important tool for us to achieve which we have achieved. Part of that because it provides us with a legally adequate general plan and it provides a presumption of validity of the housing element'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in the event that we are sued. We also must have a housing element that is in compliance with state law in order to go after certain grants and certain funding programs. So it is critical for us as a city to have a housing element that is certified by the state.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Additionally, if we do have a certified housing element by the statutory deadline, it does allow us to get on an eight year cycle for the housing element. UPDATE A large component of the housing element is built upon this concept of RINA numbers, which is your regional housing needs assessment, that that number is determined basically by the state'",
        "'speaker_8': 'handed down to the the local council of government in this case. Skog There are regional government entity and then they divide up the regional housing need into the various jurisdictional needs and then assigns those needs to the various cities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'State law requires that we provide in the housing element evidence that we can meet our arena numbers from a production standpoint, but it only allow requires us to demonstrate that we have adequate zoning in place to do so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our arena numbers are a planning tool. It is not a production tool or a production requirement of the of the city. So you can see that Long Beach has a arena allocation for this next period of of over 7000 units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This allocation, as I had said, is determined through a formula by the state handed down to the regional government entity. But in this case, Long Beach does share carry a disproportionate amount of the area's regional needs. That is something that we cannot change right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we do carry a disproportional number amount of of the area's need. We got assigned a larger burden than other surrounding cities by SAG. This chart shows you that in the previous housing element cycle, our required planning allocation was about 9500 units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That has been reduced because essentially a result of the economy and the stagnation of economic growth. So our new arena number is 7048. It is divided into categories, income categories. You will see that we are as a whole being asked to provide or allow for the opportunity for these 7048 units to be developed in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The majority of that is in the above moderate category. We have, as assistant manager Frick mentioned, gone through some extensive consultation with various community groups and stakeholders, the State and the Planning Commission, and this reflects some of that outreach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have been meeting with the Planning Commission. We've had a series of three citywide community meetings and we've had individual and group consultations with various stakeholders as a result of that. The key issues that were raised in the housing element was a lack of quality existing housing in the region.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Overcrowding clearly was an issue, a general lack of affordability along all income lines. The fact that that homelessness continues to be an issue for us, that there are few ADA accessible units within the city that are affordable and the need to disperse affordable housing throughout the city and not just in the downtown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We submitted a draft of our housing element as written by staff and by our consultant to the state. And the State provided their initial review and initial comments in August of 2013. This was very, very important to us because the state's initial review told us exactly where they wanted us to focus our energies and where they wanted'",
        "'speaker_8': 'us to revise the housing element to be more consistent with state law. The first issue that they asked us to look at was a program that we had in there related to the first right of refusal for displaced lower income households.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They asked for us to consider expanding the zoning code to allow for additional areas within the city that we would allow emergency shelters to occur as of right. They asked us to focus on transit oriented development opportunities, particularly along the Blue Lane corridor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then they talked about setting aside general fund revenues for the conduct of affordable housing in the future. So he came up with a number of programs, and I'm going to go through a list of what's in the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you can see from these charts what our existing programs that we're carrying forward and then the new programs that we are proposing in this housing element, you will see that we have taken a number of steps to introduce new concepts and new programs to address our existing needs and have expanded greatly upon the last housing element'",
        "'speaker_8': 'cycle. So we do consider a new program for the first right of refusal for displaced lower income households. This is something that came out of the downtown plan a couple of years ago. We clearly focus on the continuum of care related to our homeless and needy population.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We did include a program to expand the areas within the city where we would consider as of right winter excuse me, as of right emergency shelters. And then we listed the number of existing programs that we have for residents with special needs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Additionally, we have some new programs that were not in the housing element but that we might already have had experience with and added those to the housing element as further commitment to our programs for special needs residents. This includes our Vash program, which is a program run through our housing authority, which is our Veterans Affairs, supportive housing'",
        "'speaker_8': 'vouchers. So they are basically Section eight vouchers that are specifically geared for for veterans. And then a program to help us focus on the continuum of care, permanent supportive housing, which is very important to us in transitioning the homeless population into permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then also programs where we address projects that need additional assistance through specifically allocating Section eight vouchers in a project based mechanism to specific projects. And that's how we have been able to assist, for example, the expansion of the villages at Cambria.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a number of programs, both new and existing, related to housing and neighborhood improvement, including additional home rehabilitation programs that we're considering, comprehensive code enforcement, neighborhood improvement services. And as you know, the foreclosure registry is a new program that was not previously considered in the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we are making a commitment to continuing that program in this housing element cycle. Additionally, as it relates to housing production, we are looking at two new programs along the lines of adaptive reuse and then additional money for the housing trust fund, or frankly, not just the housing trust fund, but the housing fund in general.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Lastly, we are looking at opportunities to increase homeownership opportunities and clearly programs for mitigating government constraints that may exist to the development of affordable housing. Monitoring and review we are committing, which is of course, a requirement of state law, but we're putting it in the housing element that we're committing to annual reporting of the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So these this slide represents those additional programs that we have added to the housing element specifically to address either public stakeholder comments or state comments. And these programs as a as a iterated earlier was the first drive refusal for displaced lower income households, exploring the additional zoning categories for emergency shelters by right, focusing the use of home'",
        "'speaker_8': 'funds, which are federal funds along the PD 29 Long Beach Boulevard corridor in the downtown area, and then exploring the feasibility of some programs related to habitability of existing units. Again, these are new programs that we're proposing specifically to address stakeholder concerns.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Priority of funding near transit was a was a big issue that the state wanted us to talk about in expanding housing opportunities throughout the city as it relates to future updates of our zoning code. And then, as I had said earlier, identifying additional funds not just for the housing trust fund but for the the entire and the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'entirety of the affordable housing fund. We are specifically going to be looking at financial incentives for transit oriented development, particularly along the Long Beach Boulevard corridor. This includes the preparation of a housing action plan, specifically addressing transit oriented development and how we would be trying to offer incentives.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our housing action plan would also include a plan for how we intend to redevelop the property that is owned by the former housing development company. So in terms of housing resources, we do have a number of resources that are available today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This represents to you the fiscal 13 budget that was put that is available for affordable housing purposes. Clearly, the largest line item is the housing authority and their combination of their vouchers that they have for veterans housing for people with AIDS, Section eight vouchers, and then their project project based Section eight vouchers as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, the Housing Successor Agency still maintains a balance, and they have about $14 million available. That was in the budget for fiscal year 13. We had about $18 million in housing bonds that were not returned to the state that are available for the development of housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then we have a number of of different sources through either the state or the federal government with home and CDBG. Right now, as of today. I have about $16.8 million available in the housing fund. In addition, we do have a significant opportunities that are arising in the future for us to repay some housing debt that would'",
        "'speaker_8': 'allow us to generate approximately additional $24 million in housing funds over the next five plus years or so. In terms of the amount of existing affordable units within the city, this does include those vouchers that are offered through the housing authority through Section eight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we in in total have approximately 13,000 units citywide that are currently restricted for affordable housing. We do believe that there are more units than this that are considered affordable or or who have people living in them who are of affordable income.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But these are the ones that are deed restricted or otherwise controlled and monitored by the city for the purposes of affordable housing. So since you last got an update in your study session in December, there have been a number of changes made to the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This includes additionally additional revisions to the emergency shelter rezoning. One of the stakeholder groups had initially requested that we consider four different zones for expanding the ability to do emergency shelters. That stakeholder group has since revised their position to reduce the number of zones from four to do to two.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have subsequently reduced the zones to PD 29, which is Long Beach Boulevard and the Eye Zone, which is light industrial. So we are committing in the housing element to a program that would have us look at those zones, do an analysis, study that, and then also comply with secure and bring forth some amendments to the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'zoning code that would potentially rezone portions or all of these zones for the availability of emergency shelters. We've also revised program 3.3 since early December, and we worked very closely with the State Housing, Development, Housing and Community Development Department to rewrite this language, to consider habitability issues related to units within the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there are other programs that are available in other cities and other jurisdictions that we would look to. We are not limiting ourselves to just one specific program, but are instead committing to address habitability issues if there are issues out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we would first commit to studying those issues and then addressing them as needed. Program 4.1 relates to housing development. Again, we worked very closely with the State Department of Housing and Community Development to rewrite language regarding the preparation of this housing action plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is specifically targeting transit rich neighborhoods. HQ is very, very focused on us providing opportunities along transit corridors and urging us in our housing action plan to deal with with the transit oriented corridors. Conveniently, the property that the former housing development company owns.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is along transit oriented corridors. And so we will be wrapping the re-use of that property into the Housing Action Plan. Program 4.4 was significantly rewritten with CD, where we committed to new language regarding the investigation of funds for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a major departure from where we were a few months ago, and it does provide language that talks about the repayment of over $24 million in debt that is owed the housing fund. You yourself, as the successor agency, already took action to commit the repayment of $16 million to the housing fund when you approved a repayment'",
        "'speaker_8': 'schedule back in October as the successor agency. We will be coming to you in the future with additional amortization schedules to allow you to ask for your consideration in in reestablishing additional debt. This would be in addition to the $16 million that are currently in the housing fund right now as a result of all of this effort'",
        "'speaker_8': '. The state did issue a letter dated December 27th, which is in your packet that stated that the city's housing element as drafted is in compliance with state law. So we do believe that we have been very responsive and pushed the envelope quite a bit from where we were as a city from the old housing element to the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'proposed housing element that is before you for your consideration as part of that. I would be remiss if I did not mention that we did have to do a negative declaration. And you are being asked to certify that negative declaration as part of your adoption of the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Should you proceed to move forward with this, we would make any technical revisions to the housing element and then submit it to the state. The state still has to go through an additional review where they they ensure that we are still remain in compliance based on any changes that you might make tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then they have 90 days to provide us with the fully certified letter that we do have a fully certified housing element. So if we are proceeding tonight, we would hope that we would have a fully certified housing element by May of this year and that we would then be able to proceed with implementing the programs that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we have put forth in the housing element for your consideration. That concludes our staff report. I do have Jeff Winkel Clark, the acting planning administrator, here to help answer any questions. And then we have Bill Tremble from our consulting firm, Veronica Hammond Associates here as well to answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Ms.. Burdick, any questions at this time? Well, Mr. Austin, we're going to take public testimony.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I just have a quick, quick question regarding the the $16 million that was approved in October and the $16 million that you say we have currently in the fund? Yes, sir. What funds are those?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the city has all of the money is committed, I should say. Most of the money is committed towards affordable housing, sit in an affordable housing fund, and that that fund cannot be co-mingled. There are a number of revenues that flow into that fund, including bond proceeds in lieu fees from condo conversions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some of our home dollars that we get from the federal government are funneled into this fund as well. But as of today, we have $16.8 million in our affordable housing fund. It is not accessible to the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is not it cannot be used for any other purpose but rehab or production of affordable housing. Separately, you as a successor agency took action to reestablish some debt that was owed to the housing fund. That coincidentally is also in the amount of about 16 million.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it's $16.3 million. I believe you took that action sometime in October or November as a successor agency and you did commit to reestablishing that debt as the city receives property tax revenue through the the the flow of of tax dollars.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That money will get repaid.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much. And thank you for the very thorough staff report. I want to commend the staff for all of their hard work on this. This is a very complicated document. I know it's taken many, many hours.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I commend you for the community outreach and I want to commend the community for their participation in it. Obviously, they have had some impact on the this document in terms of, you know, the ideas that that and input that you received from the community out there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know there's more, but I think it's a great start. So congratulations on on a great element.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Public testimony. Those who tend to give testimony on this, please come forward. Identify yourself. I could get an idea how many people would like to speak. That'd be great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. My name's Gary Shelton. The address is 240 Chestnut Avenue. And good evening, council and members of staff. I wanted to just start by saying I'm here to represent the Long Beach Area Coalition for the Homeless as it advocacy chair.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You might know I've served on other boards. I'm zeroing in my comments tonight in relation to what the Miami Area Coalition for the Homeless has authorized me to do. And but I also want to acknowledge the hard work of housing Long Beach and also of Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I stand firmly behind them personally with the presentation that they may be prepared to make to you this evening regarding their comments and thought. I wanted to also mention that we heard earlier a few minutes ago that tonight what you the action you take will create what is basically a finding of substantial compliance with with state law'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And I think that's correct. And I think it's well and good. Been working for well since phase since the fourth cycle began since before it began to achieve the compliance that I believe on the narrow issue that I'm speaking about tonight has been achieved and that's program to point to the emergency shelter rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm very pleased to see that the Planning Commission decided that it would put a end date on when that would happen, and that staff has incorporated that in the report tonight. And I think that that that's going to work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm reminded of something that Kerry Gallagher, who's the the you know, a good friend of mine mentioned to me a couple of days ago. She said one thing that we can urge you to do and you might hear this later on this evening, is is to realize that compliance with the law shouldn't be the bottom line, but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rather meaningful action and related to emergency shelter by sight. Meaningful action is what it's all going to be about. There is not enough emergency shelter existing in the city right now, so to speak. For just a moment about the arena numbers related to extremely low income goals of 1773 units, I'd want to point out that based on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the past performance of the city in its ability to create extremely low income affordability for housing, that goal of 773 units or that need of 1773 units would be achieved in something along the line of 933 years from now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our performance has been dismally slow. However, however, state funding of affordable housing you know, the housing trust fund, the housing fund that Amy spoke about is extremely important for us to move forward into the next year to get that accomplished.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what I want to specifically support is program 2.2, the emergency shelter rezoning. And I also personally support the point of view of housing. Long Beach. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. The you have 3 minutes. When you see the yellow light, that means you have 30 seconds left. And I would urge you, please don't be repetitive. We have a lot of people who and I'm going to try to give you all 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if it's going to take a long time, we'll have to reduce that. So try to be economical with your time. Please identify yourself.'",

A little background. I've served as Community Development Commissioner, Board Ambassador, elected to the Community College Board of Trustees, and according to the Housing Element charts, I am'",
        "'speaker_5': 'designated as low income, so my remarks might come as a surprise. My neighborhood is very challenged with the density of a third world country and only 10% owner occupancy. We think gentrification and market rate housing is a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It creates stable neighborhoods and additional stakeholders. The housing element should be a excuse me adopted as it stands without further inclusion of anything else. City staff has worked extremely hard with all stakeholders. And the careful analysis reveals a very carefully balanced plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's the result of hard work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A vibrant, caring professionals who have taken all aspects of the Long Beach economy into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Names. Larry Good. Hugh Kirk as the address. Kirk as my address, I noted the speaker. The previous speaker, as of last as she did last week, indicated that according to the stats, she is considered low income. But I think we all agree she certainly has million dollar looks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As stated before, my position is that the where one lives, with exception of veterans and severely disabled and those are in temporary need of emergency. Housing is not the business of the city. Where the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker is a no lives is no concern to the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, there's a old paradigm that in the sports world or athletic world, if you want to get better, you play with people that are better than you got the same level of you seem to it the same thing with academics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you want to learn, you learn and you work and you interface with people that are smarter than you. I think what we should do is that I agree with the previous speaker. Don't touch the existing plan. But in the future I think what we should do is turn to a like cities like Beverly Hills, Irvine and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Newport. Find out what they do. It may require a change in paradigm, a dramatic change in paradigm, but I think that's something we should work on. Again, take care of the veterans, take care of our legals seniors, and take care of those who are temporarily in need of temporary housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But beyond that, we're that butcher where that baker, where that candlestick maker lives is not a concern of any city. Thank you.'",

Here to speak on behalf of the Chamber and our support of the agenda item 2013 2021 housing element as part of the city's general plan and move the document forward to the necessary'",
        "'speaker_4': 'agencies as outlined in the presentation. Chamber believes the housing element, as written will allow Long Beach to compete for high quality housing developments and remain economically competitive in the neighboring cities when investors come looking. Furthermore, the Chamber agrees with other organizations such as the downtown Long Beach Association, that by allowing any inclusionary housing policies into the current'",
        "'speaker_4': 'housing element, this would lead to an otherwise worrisome policy impacting a majority of the potential new development, especially in the downtown area. We believe the housing element provides sound policy and guidance for current and future Long Beach residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We commend the staff, their outreach efforts, their multiple transactions with stakeholders on both sides of this very important issue and document. We know this process was extensive, as thoroughly been research by city staff with multiple revisions as we heard during their presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Based on this work, and, as we already know, a letter of compliance from the California Department of Housing and Community Development as accepted the current version of the housing element, any and all policy efforts would serve to better positioned Long Beach for the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By improving the current and future. Housing is something the Chamber strongly endorses. Long Beach is exceedingly fortunate to have a dynamic port, an airport, excellent public transportation, direct service, by the way of multiple freeways, roadways and pathways that connect Long Beach to the region and beyond.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Evening, Mayor. Councilmember. Staff. I'll be very brief.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Joshua Holston with Urban Village. We have a project on Long Beach Boulevard in 10th for 216,000 square foot, a mixed use project encompassing both residential and retail. And I got to say, we have absolutely loved working with the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We were able to get our project approved and in short order because of the fact that it was a very collaborative setting and we were loved working as far as was staff to be able to get our project through.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lot of people didn't think we were going to break ground. We did. And there was a very challenging prospect as far as putting the funds together. The reason why I give this back story is this the way that the housing element is written as of now we think is very solid.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it is it doesn't scare off groups like ours from coming in and taking on new projects. If, for example, inclusionary housing was added to this in in addition to what is currently there, it has a couple of effects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first in our project, if anything was added on top, we would not have been able to make it work as it was. We are stretched to be able to hit that yield with the increase from the time we started construction of construction costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It even makes it more challenging to take on projects that have on market rate projects to have an affordable component.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the other thing it does, besides just.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Reducing the amount of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Projects that get approved or able to get financing to move through, is it also actually passes the burden down to the rest of the folks that are renting units or purchasing units because of the fact of the additional burden of cost.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When you do build, as you council members know, when you do build the affordable housing project or even a project that has an affordable component, then you have to pay prevailing wages. Now, regardless of where you stand on this, it still does increase the project cost by between 20 to 30%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what that does is we have to into passing that down to the residents of the market rate units, which ends up costing more. So in essence, it creates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Almost an additional.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Burden and less affordable units or less affordability for the market rate units. So with that said, I really appreciate your time and we definitely support the housing element as it currently stands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",

I also chair the housing initiative of the L.A. District Council over the July, and I serve on the adjunct faculty of the MBA program at USC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I told your study group on December ten, I believe the City Council should adopt the solid and thoughtful draft housing element with its emphasis on affordable housing.

A portion of that money is coming back to the city in the form of boomerang funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if we today set aside 20% of these boomerang funds, just like we did with redevelopment money, we can provide an opportunity to ensure the protection of housing dollars for our city.

And I just want to tell you that, you know, tenacious and I will never give up. Rose Park remembers It's taken two decades, but we've transformed Rose Park into the most desirable place to live.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what I want to tell you is, during this period of of revitalization, something else happened that my friends and neighbors, they disappeared because they could not afford to live in Rose Park. And as other neighborhoods become more livable, this is going to come true again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Poor residents will be displaced. And I feel like we marginalized them and ghettoized them. Our poor and our low income people, they live where they can afford to live. And I feel that they were really completely marginalized from us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And my concern is that so they're stuck and so we can go to them. And one of the things we can do is with child housing, like Peter was proposing is the rent trust account rep is the first step.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this program, which our sister city, Los Angeles, has had in place for many years, ensures that minimum minimum housing standards are maintained within residential rental units. And I really urge the council to consider I.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And everyone who lives their heads should have the same right to have it. And so you've really got to consider what we can do. If we're stuck out there and they can't get housing, then what can we do and whatever they're living in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you very much for your time that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, city staff, city council and Honorable Mayor. My name is Brooke Clovis, and I'm a constituent of the third district and a graduate student at Cal State Long Beach. I live on 5050 East Garfield Street. Over the past couple of months, I have attended city council meetings, the recent planning commission hearing and study session.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have heard on the I have heard from those who are opposed to the community platform saying that we need to develop a long beach that attracts highly educated young people. I have heard this statement on various occasions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a graduate student, someone who may be considered highly educated, this is quite concerning. After listening to public comments, it sounds like some Long Beach residents and stakeholders would like to transform Long Beach into a small town, beach, state, city, a city with no poverty and only upper middle class residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'While the demographics of a beach city may be appealing to some transferring Long Beach and to Newport, Newport, Redondo or even Beverly Hills is not the solution to achieving a prosperous economy and reducing crime with crime rates as it poses a threat to many Long Beach residents and myself.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The development of housing stock that is only market rate will lead to the displacement of low and middle income residents and families in Long Beach because the low paying service sector jobs that pay minimum wage are growing and City Council has not identified a permanent local source of funding for affordable development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Many of our valuable residents will no longer be able to live here. Even I fear that after I graduate with my master's degree, I will not be able to find a job in Long Beach where I can afford rent, meet my basic needs, and save my money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Save money to own a home. This is why it's important for the city to offer its working class residents a safe and healthy home that is affordable, affordable to their income level. Further transforming Long Beach into a beach city will kill what makes Long Beach one of the most unique cities in the United States, its diversity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When I moved to Long Beach, I was not attracted to the upscale developments or tourism industry. I was attracted to its diverse population, progressive reputation and unique local businesses. In no other city have I felt a sense of belonging and community where diverse populations come together to find solutions to the challenges they encounter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If the city continues to develop without affordable developments, many of Long Beach residents will be displaced and our diverse population will be obsolete. So rather than focusing on what types of people we need to attract to Long Beach, the city should make the needs of its current residents a priority.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Research has shown that when people can afford to live locally, they invest locally. And when residents and families have good paying jobs and stable homes, crime decreases. As a new resident of this great city, I urge you to use your leadership and take action.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Make this housing element about more than just compliance. Make it about strategic action that improves the quality of life for Long Beach residents and makes Long Beach an even greater city to live in. Thank you. Next to. Good evening, counsel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Janine Pearce. I know many of you. I am a second district resident and I'm director at Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, where our mission is to make sure that all working families have a living wage, a roof over their head, and that we're working on new development and we're working on new ways'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to make sure our cities are thriving, that they're not a city of the past, but that we're continuing to grow and inspire new business to come in and to make sure that residents are able to contribute to that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so as a part of that mission, affordable housing has always been something at the heart of what we do. Madeline Janis, one of our co-founders, was on the Redevelopment Agency Committee in Los Angeles for ten years where she fought to make sure that we did have strong development that included affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why do we need to have affordable housing if we have workers making a living wage in the city, which I'd like to applaud all of you for taking a stand on living, wages are really critical. Living wages are to make sure that we meet the bare necessities again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Same thing with the document that you have in front of you. It sets the bottom, it doesn't set the top. And so at $13 an hour, workers are bringing home if if they're working 40 hours a week at $13 an hour, they're bringing home roughly $27,000 a year for the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They mandate, they say, that for a worker to be able to afford housing, that it should be at 30% of their income level or less. So a worker making $27,000 a year, they're barely able to afford housing. They would still qualify for what the federal government mandates as low income housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for that reason, even with the living wage, we need to make sure that we have affordable housing at some level to where families can make sure that they're not living on top of each other in poor conditions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've heard from previous tenants. We know that the workers in the city are 35 I'm sorry, 50% of the residents in the city spend 35% of their income on housing. If we want to have a city that's thriving, we want to make sure that the residents here have money to spend.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's the same argument as was made with measuring. If families have money in their pocket, they're going to spend it locally. Let's make sure that we're building a city that can thrive for everyone and that residents here can live healthy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They can spend money in local businesses and make sure that we are a thriving city that we want to have. And so that's why Lane and the Long Beach Coalition stand with housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it's a core issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's very important to us, and we look forward to voting on that on the small edits tonight and making sure that we can do this in 2014 instead of pushing it on to where we've forgotten what a program is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to make sure that we do find a dedicated source of funding the 20% that was taken out of the affordable out of the housing trust fund. We want we want to make sure that that's put back. So thank you very much for your time and your leadership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And doing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I rise to a point of order according to procedures, that my patient as speaker is allowed to get his ideas off his mind. If it's not on the agenda, that's guaranteed. At the beginning, I was assured I would be fourth place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Obviously, I'm not the fourth placed speaker now. I like to have feedback on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is public. This is on hearing item number one. This is not public comment, Mr. Dunn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, as a rule, we have public comment prior to actual agenda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, prior to the consent calendar, not prior to hearings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What would I be wrong in saying that three three slots are allowed for a speaker after the proceedings?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're out of order. This is not public comment. Well, you need to.'",

But that's all right. That's another thing. But other than that, I do support affordable housing because it do help the neighborhoods.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Your own city. Because. I used to live here. African-Americans did live here and had they own homes. And all of a sudden, now they're selling their homes. I'm an African-American man. I got one. I got two kids, Desiree and and I got a stepdad, Isaiah Tapp, that he.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you all for letting me.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'But I understand. I'm a citizen of the city. I'm just getting tired of seeing condos over here in downtown Long Beach. Have nobody and nobody filling them. We need more affordable housing to take care of that. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'In my 30 years in the military, I worked my way up from the bottom and up and I lived in low income housing. And I remember in Boston where I lived and in low income housing on a reclaimed dump, and with my four children and traveling around the country.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Of Southern.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'California, Los Angeles, Ventura County's Chapter. We are a trade association representing about a thousand member companies and their employees. Our members are for rent, for sale, affordable housing developers, as well as all the trades and the the employees that make up every aspect of home building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From plumbers, electricians, roofers, painters, escrow companies, etc.. And I'm here to ask you to please adopt the housing element as presented. Staff and the professional consultant team has worked tirelessly to present this document, and moving forward with an inclusionary housing proposal only is a detriment to moving jobs forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our housing industry has been tremendously impacted by this downturn and Great Recession. We are looking to create jobs, not prevent jobs from moving forward. We're looking to have this economy pick up. And the way to do that is by obviously creating more jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Quality jobs that pay good, good dollars and help stimulate the economy and make housing more affordable. When we add linkage fees, it only makes housing less affordable. And I think it's important to to realize that development in general is not opposed to affordable housing and finding solutions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, this is not a Long Beach issue. It's a state issue. It's a national issue. We need to deal with it on a global level. Currently, at the state level, we have the DeSaulnier Bill SB 391, which offers a broader base for funding to help address affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think we need to look at opportunities like this bill. It's not perfect, but it is a way to address affordable housing and we need to look at it from a global perspective. I think adding it without careful analysis will only hurt and hinder future growth not only in Long Beach but throughout the state and throughout'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the country. I strongly encourage you to adopt the housing element as presented, and I thank you and staff and the professional consultant team that put this document forth together tonight. Thank you. Good evening, Diane, which means I'm also a disabilities rights advocate, and I do understand the need for housing assistance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, inclusionary housing and linkage fees are extremely discriminatory against individuals. Rather than spreading the burden over an entire population. It's a sure way to destroy incentive. There's a simple rule here. If you force inclusionary housing or inclusionary housing in linkage fees, you will drive up the costs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You will eliminate the incentive to build. And developers can just go elsewhere to invest their time, effort and money. And they will. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we.'",

I am a documentary filmmaker, and I come here with a unique perspective. My partner and I directed a 30 minute documentary for housing in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was able to hear stories of stories in which you heard before about people living in crowded conditions, people living in rat and other insect infested apartments, and what they all wanted, what the bottom line was. They wanted affordable housing and they wanted to live in dignity with their families.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They feel that their. The bottom line was not that they were poor. The bottom line is that they're here trying to have and trying to live a better life for themselves and their children. And they feel that that will definitely be threatened.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These were just a few of the many stories of the people living day to day, paycheck to paycheck here in the city of Long Beach. So I asked the city council members and the city excuse me, I asked the city council members and citizens of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, all of us should have the right to live in decent conditions which give all residents of Long Beach dignity. Please don't make people have to choose between paying the rent. Or paying for food. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Carrie Gallagher. I live at 626 East Eighth Street in the First District. And I'm here tonight as the executive director of housing Long Beach. You know, when I walked in tonight, a representative of the debate asked if I would wear one of their stickers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I put it on because it says, we support the housing element and we do. And so I think that hopefully we can walk away tonight finding that, in fact, maybe we have more in common that we often than we often like to think.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I look around at this room and I see my neighbors, I see my city, I see my community, every person in this room. And I think we all have a shared vision for healthy residents. We all have a shared vision for economic vitality.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we all share the vision for a thriving Long Beach. And so I think it should be noted that at the Planning Commission hearing, the city council study session and even tonight, you have heard little to no opposition around a number of the points that we've been proposing, especially the program, and expedite the expediting of the timeline'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of this program, as well as the allocation of 20% of boomerang funds as they return to the city. And so I really want to just step back and housing Long Beach as an organization, as a community. Advocates really want to thank the city for the time and effort that they've put into this document for the efforts that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'staff and council have put into meeting with us and hearing about our concerns as we work with hundreds of residents on a weekly basis and here the living conditions that people are facing. And so I want to reiterate tonight again that compliance does not necessarily equate to leadership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Leadership goes beyond compliance. Leadership goes beyond the bottom line. And so that we have crafted a document that will work with the state. We hope that you will work with us as community members to react, to craft an even stronger document that will have concrete and tangible changes for residents in the coming eight years as this housing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'element is put into place. Many of you are aware that housing Long Beach asked for and for this hearing date to be pushed back since it's so soon and residents are just returning from their holiday breaks and unfortunately the city was not able to accommodate that request.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what we heard from the city manager's office was this was largely due to the fact that we wanted to ensure we would have sufficient time to make any edits. And so I would like to remind you that the housing element is due to the state on February 12th.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So whatever you do tonight and the edits that you're able to make, we have more than sufficient time to make those changes before this document goes to the state or is due to the state in five weeks time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lastly, I just want to reiterate our three edits that we are asking you to make tonight. The first is that the element would be revised for the ordinance to be presented to the City Council by June of 2014.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second is that the housing element would be revised to allocate and protect 20% of boomerang funds as they return to the city for the next eight years for affordable housing. And the last is that the housing element should be revised to say that the city will consider a mixed income housing ordinance within the parameters of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'law and in anticipation of outstanding cases. Thank you again for your work and for your attention to this issue, and we look forward to working together in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council members. My name is Pat Denniston. I live at 3595 Santa Fe Avenue, space number 149 in Wynwood Village. I had no intention of speaking tonight. I came here to learn because I had been reading a lot in the newspaper about the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I have learned a lot tonight. And what I've learned is that you have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Really.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Worked hard to put together something for this city that will give housing, affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, affordable housing, though, can come in various stages. In 1945, it was then that my father drove the car into California. I have lived here in Long Beach ever since that day. I love Long Beach, but there are some things that I'd like to see changed, just like anyone else.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I want to ask you a question, and probably if you could answer my question right off the bat, I wouldn't go any further. But the question is this How are the people living in mobile home parks affected by this element?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Were they taken into consideration back in 1985? My husband and I made the decision to move into Windward Village because it was a beautiful mobile home park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when we looked at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Finances, we said, when we retire, we want to be able to support ourselves and not live off of someone else. And we knew we could do it at that. So we moved in there. It seems to me that we can be doing everything possible to get the people off the street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But here's what has happened in our park. A few years back, the city council approved a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Subdivision for a windward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Village and the majority of the residents were not in favor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, for the last four years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our rent has been raised.'",
        "'speaker_4': '$50 a month. For the last four years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You also cannot sell your home unless they buy the lot also, which is overpriced to begin with. That lowers the equity on our home greatly and it puts us down, way down in the income level. People are having to walk away and leave everything there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if you have not seen it, please come.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll be glad.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To walk you around the park and show you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's very difficult.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know. It's emotional. I apologize. You really have to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will do it right now. As of now, there are approximately.'",
        "'speaker_5': '40 to 50 who have bought their land. That is out of 305 units. That's not a very high percentage. So I ask you, you figure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Out how many are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Being displaced. We're seeing it happen. Okay. So I ask you again, how are the people living in the mobile home parks affected by this element? That's all I want to know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, ma'am. We'll try to get that answer for you. Thank you. Amy, you have a quick answer for that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mayor, members of the city council. We did actually address that issue. It is a brand new program that we've never had the ability to fund or implement because of some previous funding constraints that we had related to mobile home parks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we do have a program that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Trying to find that specifically provides program 3.3 D Mobile Home Repair Grants. The city proposes to create a new program that provides up to $12,000 per unit in grants for repairs of mobile homes occupied by extremely low income households.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This program would be funded by the Housing Trust Fund. We have found in the past that residents who own mobile coaches have had difficulties getting loans because of the loan to value ratios that they have. And there have been cases where there have been extreme needs for emergency repairs to roofs or heaters to keep those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mobile coaches habitable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as part of this housing element, we did specifically craft this as a grant to eligible residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you, Amy. I want to take it behind the rail. Thank you all for your comments, Mr. Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank you, Mayor, and I appreciate the many speakers who came out and spoke to passing this item. And I you know, Pat, as much as one of my constituents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate your advocacy as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A mother. When we're at Village Folks and of course, you know, I've been out there many times. And part of the challenge is the state of California actually has a lot of regulatory control over mobile home park. So that's kind of a complicating factor there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I will say that I think, you know, going back in time, I wasn't on the council, but the vote to subdivide that two lots may have been a mistake. So I hear you're concerned about that. One question I have for you, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bodak, is we've heard a lot of people here advocate tonight for this program, which apparently they've said has worked in Los Angeles. Now, we're not Los Angeles. We're a different city, but certainly we're wise enough to learn from others.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know we've talked about this briefly before, but you walk us through what staff are proposing. It sounds like you're proposing to stay this issue and come back in 2016 with some some communication to council. Can you talk about what you're planning to do on the subject?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly for members of the public and the city council, this is related to program 3.3 I somewhere around page 117. In the red line version, we are looking at issues related to code enforcement and general habitability is an issue that we must address.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The housing element does demonstrate that we have a substantial amount of units that are 50 years or older and that does present potential issues related to habitability. So in as you know, we have a pretty vigorous code enforcement program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, the advocate groups have asked us to consider a specific program, which is Los Angeles based, related to a rent escrow account or the acronym REAP. We are not sure that that program is necessarily the best thing for Long Beach or the most appropriate program for Long Beach, but committed to doing research on the issue and trying'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to understand what the need is that we're trying to solve with implementing a program. The City of Los Angeles program is a multimillion dollar program that has 11 full time staffers committed to it in one department. That does not include the additional staff in auxiliary departments of financial management, city attorney or city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we did commit to looking at this as a potential issue, too, to address habitability issues. But to give you a comparison, there's approximately 176,000 units in the city of Long Beach. We believe we handle approximately 10,000 code enforcement cases every year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those code enforcement cases range from a substandard building to an illegal garage conversion to graffiti and paint peels and an oversize fence. So those 10,000 cases are not all related to habitability issues, but some of them are just pure esthetical issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Others are clearly much more serious. That equates to about 5.5% of the total housing stock in the city we have handled in the in the fiscal year 2012, 10,000 code enforcement cases. Of those, only 24 were substandard building code cases.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so we're not sure what, what the need is that we're trying to resolve. But in in in an effort to make sure that we are addressing code enforcement as much as possible and are doing the best that we can to address habitability issues we have agreed to to look into not only the Los Angeles program, but'",
        "'speaker_8': 'other programs as well. We are committing to investigating these opportunities by the end of 2014 and to report those findings to the City Council in 2015. And then if the City Council wishes us to proceed, implement an actual program and strategy by the end of 2015.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I had her in a meeting earlier today that it was no action. If action were to happen and we're not going to bind ourselves, we need to get well-educated issue. The plan was saying it would be in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it sounds like you're saying that's inaccurate, that according to the plan you're submitting or you submitted to the state the says discussion in 2014 and then action, if any, in 2015. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what I'm reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Well, thank you. And for the clarification. The other question I had is there seems to be a concern from some residents out there about the bad landlords. And, you know, my father in law is a landlord and we know the vast majority of landlords, like the vast majority of people, are good folks doing the right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thing. But there may be 1% or 3% who aren't. And it sounds like one concern out there is people may not be calling code enforcement because they're afraid of being evicted or having the rent raised in retaliatory fashions, which probably are illegal under state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But because these folks may be low income or not sophisticated, don't have the ability to protest that. So what if someone is in that situation where they're fearing calling the city because they're afraid of being evicted or having their rent raised in retaliation?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's our answer to help that person?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's actually two things. If a person calls, they can talk about code enforcement related to the general building. It doesn't necessarily have to be to the specific unit. If there are code enforcement issues related to the general building, there is no way of the landlord knowing what the issues are and who raised them, because the our reports'",
        "'speaker_8': 'are are kept confidential on who the reporting entity is. We also do a lot of referrals, particularly to not only legal aid, but also to the Fair Housing Foundation, where we do ask both of those entities to help us address some of those issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we do believe that, you know, that is a concern that's out there with the number of tenants. We've had numerous discussions with the Apartment Owners Association in terms of educating their landlords on habitability issues and those processes will continue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't necessarily think though that focusing on the rep program will address that issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I appreciate then I just ask that, you know, after tonight, you continue to have these conversations and really figure out, like I said, most landlords are great folks doing the right thing. And frankly, probably the people involved in the apartment association aren't the problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there are some folks out there who are clearly taking advantage of some of these low income folks. And and I think maybe part of the answer is just informing them what rights they already have and making sure that everybody knows, considering these, including as advocacy groups, what the right channels are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to thank you for putting a lot of hard work in this plan over the last couple of years and look forward hearing from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What's their Garcia?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to, you know, first just start off by thanking staff for their hard work. This has been, I know, a lot of hard work for not just Ms.. Building, but for the entire team.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I also want to thank the community, the whole community for not just coming out tonight, but for working and being involved in this plan. The reality is, is that what we have in front of us is a solid document that, quite frankly, is a better document because all of you had so much input in it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And where it was, I think, when it was first presented to where it is now because of input, particularly from housing advocates and and those that have been involved in this discussion for so long, we've been able to make some changes, I think, along the way that have made this a stronger document.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I also will agree with one of our speakers who spoke about I think there's a lot more, quite frankly, that we all agree on than disagree. I think at the end of the day, we all want, regardless of where you live in Long Beach, we all want a healthy city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We all want businesses to succeed. We all certainly want to help those that need our help the most and those that are having challenges of poverty and other issues. So I think that we we do agree more than we disagree.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think, you know, for for a lot of us particularly see a lot of my downtown neighbors that are here, I think that most of us I would include myself. I certainly bought a place downtown because I liked the diversity of the neighborhood and not just the diversity of the people, but also the economic diversity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I love the fact that there are all types of people of all ages, of all colors, of all income levels that live in my neighborhood. And that's certainly something that I value and a place that I enjoy to live and hope that my neighborhood stays stays that way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to continue on on the issue of the rent escrow account program for now, and I'm sure there's a lot of other additional comments. So, I mean, the way I've. Simplified the program in just the research that I've done is we're really talking about a an enforcement tool mechanism that could produce a really important tool for'",
        "'speaker_10': 'us to go after some of these, quite frankly, in some cases, slumlords and those that are really not just taking advantage of the renters, but are, quite frankly, creating incredible blight throughout the city. And I know some of there are some of my ah willmore neighbors that are here as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the reality is you drive, whether it's Willmore or whether someone was here earlier from Rose Park or some of these neighborhoods, there are some of these cracker box apartments that are just completely below that. I would classify them as substandard.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm not sure what our substandard classification is that we use at the city, but certainly I believe there's there's a lot more than the 24 that we found through code enforcement cases last year. So I guess I'm wondering, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Barack, I do have a question on the first version of the housing element had a reference to the city having possibly 10,000 or maybe 10,000 units that were kind of on the brink of being subsistence sub standard. And then I don't know that it's in this current version is that can you explain to me how that moved'",
        "'speaker_10': 'or changed?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have approximately 10,000 code enforcement cases annually. When we first looked at and did the the underlying data analysis that fed into the the document, we were using code enforcement information based on a three month period for the current fiscal year excuse me, the last current the last fiscal year since that the first draft was produced in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the spring. We have since been able to revise the numbers to accommodate for a full year of data. And so the numbers did change. But as I did say, we do have approximately 10,000 code enforcement cases on an annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So. I. I, for one, am interested in us doing our research on this rent escrow account program. And I would agree that just because ELAs works a certain way doesn't mean ours would work the same way. And I think, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Barak, you and I had a discussion earlier about, you know, kind of figuring out what what the Long Beach model would be or if there was a if there was a program out there. Maybe it's it's another program out there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know Sacramento does something that's that's different than Los Angeles, but still similar. But but finding what could work for us and they could still go and address some of these these tenant improvement these landlord improvement issues. And these these developments that we have, I think would be would be very beneficial for us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do I am concerned a little bit about our about our timeline. I would think that we would be able to revisit that this year. I don't think it necessarily needs to be. You know, we don't have all the information, but I think that it would be important for the council to be able to have a discussion'",
        "'speaker_10': 'sooner rather than later about what this could look like for us. Give our input, allow the community to give input, and then work towards building a program like this. If it were and you're right, we're not sure yet what could work for us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But certainly I think the sooner that we know, I think would be a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly, I do want to point out that we must wait for the state to give their final blessing on the housing element. They have up to 90 days to do that. So theoretically, if we submit this by February 12th, we would be waiting until May at a minimum to know that we have a certified housing element.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think it is feasible for us to get a certified housing element and conduct research and come back to you by June. I just do not think that that's feasible. We put in here timeframes that we felt that we could commit to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do not want to have to explain myself in future years as to why we were unable to do something because we didn't have enough time to do something or we didn't have adequate staff resources. So this is why we came up with the timelines that we did for 2014 and 2015.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly it is within your discretion to change that and we will do our best to comply with that. But there were there was a method to the madness of coming up with these schedules.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I'll be interested to hear my other colleagues input on this, but if we're able to, I think, get information sooner, that'd be that'd be a good thing on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Grand jurors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to ask the city manager what would be the 20% impact on the city if we hear between.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor and councilmembers? There's talk about boomerang funds. We really don't know what a boomerang fund is. These moneys that are coming to us, we don't have a redevelopment agency anymore. So the dollars that come to us through our property taxes go into the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We program those. As you know, we present to you a three year budget, the moneys that are in our property tax, go to the general fund and support police, fire, parks and recreation, things that are in our general fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if indeed the Council decided to lessen the amount of property tax that we get in assigned that to another fund, certainly that's something that would put us in a deficit next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, Mr. Neal, let's get a motion or somebody to Neill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I appreciate the dialog that has gone back and forth here. I do have some questions along the line of the vice mayor, Miss Barack, in regards to reporting back in in the area of rape.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would would December be adequate time for you and your staff to come back to this council with something that we could look at?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sir, we do have something that that does discuss us concluding our research by the end of 2014. So we would be able to conclude that research on not just the program, but the Sacramento program, the Oakland program, this franchise tax board, substandard housing program, and then any other programs that the advocates would wish us to look at'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Thank you. And Mr. City Manager. In your last statement, you said that if we were to look at boomerang funds, we would be putting the the general fund in a deficit. If I if I understand you correctly, did not the housing funds come out of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wasn't 20% of the housing funds derived from the redevelopment? How would that put us in a deficit when.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members when we had a redevelopment agency, 20% of the dollars in the redevelopment agency did go to affordable housing. And as everyone knows, we had one of the more robust housing programs in the state of California. There is no redevelopment agency anymore, so there are no redevelopment dollars to take 20% aside from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the redevelopment department does not exist. There are no redevelopment tax increment dollars coming to the city. So what has happened? The taxes, the incremental taxes that were paid then went to the general that went to the redevelopment agency no longer exists.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those funds now go to the city as property tax in the general fund arena. So there are no 20% set aside dollars that exist from the redevelopment agency because the redevelopment agency no longer exists.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that being said, what is the plan for us to address our housing requirements moving into the future?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember as you saw in the report, we have millions of dollars this year and coming to us in the future for the housing arena right now, Amy said, we have about $16 million in the bank that are that can be allocated to housing projects today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you know, on a structural basis, we have approximately, I think Amy pointed out, $85 million coming to us on an annual basis to our housing authority for Section eight vouchers. Many of them go to our homeless families.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also have home dollars that come to us on an annual basis. Those dollars are used for affordable housing. Also, our CDBG dollars, we have a certain percentage of the CDBG Community Development BLOCK Fund grants on a structural basis that go forward, that come into us for housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Other than that, we also have some housing bond moneys. That is one time that that we do expect. And as Amy did point out, we're all aware that the Downtown Redevelopment Agency was going to expire in, I think, 2017.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That portion of the Downtown Redevelopment Agency owes the city approximately $110,000 or so. The state has agreed to refund those dollars to us, and that was part of the legislation. And 20% of all of those proceeds will come back to the city for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But again, that's money that will come to us as debt repayment from the state in a couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is 23 million. Did you know?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Pardon?'",
        "'speaker_1': '10 million.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Million? Yes. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to make sure we got the right message. Just took a few zeroes out, that's all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one final question, Mr. West, in regards to the boomerang funding, what is the estimate or can you estimate what we will be receiving in years to come?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again, it's just that the concept of what a boomerang fund is, to use the word boomerang, means that we're continuing to receive redevelopment dollars that boomerang and come back to the city. There is no redevelopment agency. There are no funds that are boomeranging back to the city from the redevelopment agency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The redevelopment agency is dead. It's gone. We're not reaching out to recreate it. It's gone. So what comes to us now is property tax without the redevelopment agency. From what I understand, Mr. GROSS isn't here tonight, but I believe our excess property tax comes to us in the amount of approximately $8 million annually.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if you wanted to reduce that by 20%, we would lose whatever. 20% of $8 million would be 1.6 million. Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So let me make sure I understand this correctly. So in 2014, you're saying we're not going to get any boomerang funds. In 2015, we're not going to receive any boomerang funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are receiving property tax, an additional $8 million of property tax annually because. There is no redevelopment agency and that goes straight to the general fund. That $8 million was programed into the fiscal year 2014 budget to pay for police, fire, parks and rec libraries and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it is gone. There are no excess funds. The money is anticipated to be spent in 2015 and 16 to solve our budget problems. As you know, we presented a three year budget look see, and those funds are committed to that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If indeed the city council chose not to fund police, fire parks and rec libraries with our general fund dollars and put it someplace else, that definitely would put us into a deficit for those two years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Mr..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you conclude custom membership scheme.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have yours from I first of all I would like to thank city staff. I know they have been extremely diligent working on this housing element, but I also want to thank the people that have come tonight and they've come here diligently themselves.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I, I think what Kerry said is very important, that I would hope that all of the parties here in this room, pro con on a housing element, understand what Kerry Gallagher said. And that is everybody is on the same side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Everybody wants to make housing in this city what it needs to be, and that is to be able to have it available for everyone who needs it. One of the things McKinsey and Company has just done an interesting report about how to make a city great.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they looked around the world and they talked to mayors of all these major cities and the cities that have transformed themselves, among other things, did smart growth. But they also looked and took care of. They focused in on those who weren't doing as well as everyone else in the city and because they felt equal justice for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'all. And that included about housing was extremely important to the quality of life in that city. And those cities have turned themselves around.

        "'speaker_6': 'an oxymoron, it's very unaffordable in California, Southern California, particularly to be able to buy a house, particularly with the economy being it is, and that people are not having the salaried jobs that they once had. So I think we need to make certain that when we cast aspersions on the category of calling affordable housing, that we're not'",

        "'speaker_6': 'It means that we want to move forward together as a city. I would say about the code enforcement, the RE program. I would hope I know staff has a lot of things on their plate, but I also know this council, when it wants to move forward and get something passed, it does quickly, as we're going to see'",
        "'speaker_6': 'later tonight on some some issues. But I would hope that we do seriously look at the program and maybe misspoke. I know you talked about 10,000 code enforcement complaints, and I think about 5000 of them come from my office.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But Kitty, I saw Angela shaking her head up and down over there, sort of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I will tell you, in my district, we have never yet had a complaint about inhabitable housing from a person who rents or lives in some place. So what? I do think that code enforcement can be a valuable tool.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have the laws on the books. We, you know, and I and I know your department is just fastidious about responding to these concerns. So I'm wondering if there's in some way, while you're investigating this program, if we can't get it communicated to tenants and others, that code enforcement is a phone number that they should call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If, in fact, because I know that most of the time that the response to 5 to 7 code, I know that most of the time that it staff's very diligent about not indicating the source of the call, but simply investigating the complaint.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And although some people can pretty much piece something together if it's coming from an inhabitable situation, I would just hope that somehow the city can do some more outreach to let people know that this is available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Understood. We do have a education program that we do in conjunction with our multifamily housing inspection program, but there is always room for improvement. And so we can certainly look at making that much more robust as part of this effort.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And on the question about Mr. Rosen, about sources of funding down the line. Actually, I've had this same discussion that not to refer to any of these funding. It's boomerang. Nothing's coming back. This is simply tax increment that we should have realized if we hadn't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Redevelopment agencies are coming back from any source is basically, isn't it? It's the additional tax increment that we hadn't had for the years. So I'm wondering, you mentioned that and actually I didn't know we had 16 million. Is there any way staff could provide at some point a certain kind of a breakdown?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know you verbally said where the source is that money came from, but. Not only that, but perhaps where we think it's going to be utilized. I mean, what's down the line? I think that needs to be communicated in the public that we've got the source of funding and where are we going with it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cuts were certainly the report that Amy did certainly listed the funding, but certainly a little.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Bit more of a narrative, I think would certainly for that, certainly addressing only that particular thing.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank all of the members that did come today and for your continued advocacy and participation in this process. Mr. Grech, I, I know you've heard from other Council members on the issue of substandard housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to share, I think between the first and second districts we probably have more than what code enforcement is officially aware of, which tells me that renters do fear the risk of being evicted. The handful of folks that I know that have complained about substandard housing had been evicted even though they contacted the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't have the ability to protect individuals from eviction. That's not the sign authority that we have. It's not something that we're even able to promise. And so even anonymity doesn't guarantee that. And that's the challenge, because traditionally renters and residents don't go straight to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They do try to exhaust all of their resources and they try to work with the manager and the landlord. And so that becomes a way to identify yourself as having had that particular issue. So having said that, I do want to share that I concur with council members here that have suggested that there are parts of our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'city where housing is not up to standard and up to code, and we're aware of that. And we are a limited resourced city. And so if there are opportunities to identify additional resources to address that very specific issue, specifically because about 50% of our residents are renters and that's 50% of this city's residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it's important to ensure that we address that we have great housing that's come online. And many of the individuals that spoke tonight are beneficiaries of that. And and I'm happy for that. But at the same time, acknowledging the progress that we make cannot be done by denying some of the challenges that we still have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we do have these challenges, and I want to make sure that I express my support to expedite the rental escrow program review and at least earlier than what was previously stated. But I do think staff had just committed to that, bringing it within the 2014 year, and I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With that, I wanted to just share my support for the points that have been advocated tonight. I do think that this document is significant and important enough to be sure that we do provide that roadmap for a optimistic future for those of us who don't live in the housing that we deserve to live in.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know, I think it's a good discussion this evening. Thank you all for your participation. I think this process has definitely improved the final product.

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I would like to just add a friendly amendment to that in regard to the ordinance, if we could get a time certain that they could report back to us by December of 2014. And I have one major concern with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The major concern is in regards to the actual funding that is going to be dedicated into affordable housing. I would like to propose that we do 10% of the property tax funds dedicated annually.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'How is it $10 million or something?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it was probably more than that was property tax producer 60 million or something like that.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Can I just try to just try to talk about this? Mr. Neal Yes. Mr. Neal These are not boomerang funds. These. The only.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reason we have more money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is because redevelopment is dissolved. The incremental tax that was frozen is now removed. So the reason we have more money, quite frankly, is from success of redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From added property tax values that are now taxed at that full amount.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what's coming into the city. If you take 1.6 million or 20% of this this additional increment, you're going to have to find 1.6 million to fill a budget hole. And I just think that after what we've been through, that is given the fact that you don't even know how much is coming in for housing, to me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is not a fruitful endeavor.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Can you repeat the funds that we have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, go ahead, Amy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So we're going to try this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The housing fund is a dedicated fund within the city that you annually include in your budget process, but it is not part of the general fund. Currently, there's $16.8 million in cash today in the housing fund that we've been accumulating.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That includes additional bond proceeds. That includes home funds, condo conversion fees, coastal and lieu fees, a bunch of other things. Additionally, the downtown project area city manager West stated.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We will be shortly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Coming to you with an additional request to reinstate $8.1 million in debt, a new debt to the housing fund. So that would bring it to 16.8 plus 16.3 plus 8.1.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Has debt that it is owed that the redevelopment agency owes the city under AB 1484 the dissolution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rules. When the city reestablishes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That debt, which is approximately $110 million, 20% of all of the debt repayment must be set aside for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if I add those numbers up, Amy, is 40 million plus 22 million that close?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Plus, we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The annual.'",

But we do have other resources to assist, you know, challenged, you know, families with challenged incomes. It's not just these dollars.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So it is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Inaccurate to say that there will not be a continuous stream while that debt is out there. There will be a stream of revenues that is going to the housing fund and that is guaranteed under AB 1480 for the redevelopment dissolution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Under under what you just laid out, that's like $65 million over over the course of how, how long.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We think it could take anywhere from 3 to 10 or 15 years to do that. We cannot estimate the time frame at this point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's there's no dedicated amount that's going to go back. And. Well, we know that we have 65 million coming.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So now my motion reads that I want the report and it's to be presented, the amendment, the report, and it's presented to the City Council for Consideration and Adoption by December 2014.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank you, Mayor. I think all of us here support affordable housing, but I do think there's a philosophical issue here, which is that if we were to take general fund dollars and put them in to low income housing, what we would be doing is reducing funding for parks, libraries, firefighters, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think the issue there is those things all have their own needs, but particularly for people, low income folks. Right. Low income folks typically need the public safety protection benefit from recreation programs because they may not be able to afford going to the country club benefit libraries because they can't just go to bars in mobile and'",

        "'speaker_4': 'To put money over here for low income housing, I don't think benefits the city, and I also don't think it even benefits people we'd be trying to benefit. So I do support affordable housing. I think the state did the wrong thing, ending redevelopment funds, which was the primary source.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'It is an art rather than a science because it does depend on, you know, the approval of each individual copy. So we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can't present this with with 100% accuracy, but certainly our best guess.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank you, Ms.. Bodak and I encourage everyone who is interested to take a look at that online. I think the bottom line is that vast areas of the city, including residential neighborhoods, are not eligible for electronic billboards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that is that correct? As a as a generalization?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, sir. That's very fair to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Well, with that, I would like to go ahead and move the staff recommendation the second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Secondary.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's emotion in the second Constable Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No past. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Neal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Miss BODETT, could you explain subsection C to me, please? Specifically 21.5 4.170.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think his.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Page. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what we have defined under this ordinance, all billboards that don't have a copy would be considered non-conforming. That was not our intention. We are trying to define certain billboards as being non-conforming and then allow for the opportunity for other billboards to be converted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the the the billboards that fall under this category, are you familiar with them? I believe it's like five of them. Are they conforming now? Are they are they conforming under our current?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They would be non-conforming.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Had. But they're conforming under state law, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They would not be. If this is a defined landscape buffer under Caltrans definitions, they would not be able to build a billboard there now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So these particular billboards have been grandfathered in and they've been there for so long that. Have they had? I guess what I'm getting at is have we had complaints and challenges in regards to these as far as people trying to a requesting that they be removed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Five billboards you're referring to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My understanding is that they are loaned the the four or five freeway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there are a number of billboards along the four or five freeway and there are a number of electronic on-premise signs along the four or five freeway that the two electronic signs that you see on the four or five freeway are not considered billboards.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we do not have any electronic billboards today in the city. We only have static billboards. So we don't have experience in dealing with complaints related to electronic billboards because we technically don't have any in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I would like to move a friendly amendment on this, if we could. And just as we strike subsection C 21.5 4.17 on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. There's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There was that. I'm sorry. I wanted to clarify that, actually. Was that a friendly amendment or without a substantive motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Well, that's where Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thinks by spirit. Well, I guess I'd ask staff. Describe why. What is section C? What does it do? And what was staff's intention in placing subsection C? And finally, and I usually only ask three part questions, I apologize, but what would be the effect of removing subsection C?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have defined existing billboards that are built within landscape buffers to be non-conforming, meaning that they would not be able to be built today. They're they're essentially illegal or non-conforming. We have established a series of criteria to define those billboards which we would allow to be converted, and those billboards which we do not believe should be'",
        "'speaker_8': 'converted. The removal of this section would negate the purpose of the ordinance, which is to remove non-conforming billboards. I'm sure you had more questions, sir. I can't remember them all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, yeah. So based on what you're saying is the purpose of the substantive C is to provide an incentive for the billboard companies to participate in the cap and trade and convert to electronic or.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In a sense, yes. You know, there are a number of billboards throughout the city that we believe should not convert to digital. And we believe that by complying with the Caltrans standards of not allowing an electronic billboard within the landscape, buffer is one of those situations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is one caveat where an existing billboard within the landscape landscaped buffer along the four or five freeway could convert. And that is if they acquire credits through Caltrans, which a number of the billboard companies already have, and that Caltrans would allow them to use their credits that they've gained from another location in the state and apply'",
        "'speaker_8': 'them to the Long Beach location. Our ordinance specifically allows that to occur within the landscaped buffer, provided that they have the Caltrans credits and apply those to the Long Beach location. Otherwise, we are treating this as a consistent land use.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are not segregating one company versus another. We are looking at this as as one land use issue across the board. We have determined, you know, that there is a number of of non-conforming billboards within the city that that should be removed, that are in inappropriate locations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the removal of this section would negate that purpose.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will given staff's opinion that removal would be against the integrity of the statute and given the fact we've talked about for three years. Mr. Neal, I respectfully not want to take that amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Are you making a substitute or are you just leaving it as is for now?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I'm just going to leave it at that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilman O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I actually James Johnson asked my question. So I'm I'm ready to hear from the public.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So, you know, other counties coming in right now, I'm going to open it up to public comment. Please step forward if you have a comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor, council members. I'm Ron Miller, executive secretary of the Los Angeles Orange County Building and Construction Trades Council. We stand in support of this amendment. We have an agreement with a couple of the billboard companies that will put a lot of our folks to work, taking down the illegitimate billboards and putting up whatever new'",
        "'speaker_2': 'electronic billboards transpire, which are going to put men and women from your community to work. So that's the bare basics of it. So we stand in support. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, it's a little redundant because there's an agreement that we're going to have electronic billboards. But I would like to give my advocacy that, Proposition two, that we should have electronic billboards. Even if it sounds superfluous for me, I would say it first of all, it's an abridgment a speech.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not to have billboards, to make announcements. And Mr. Parkin might want to address himself to that problem after I'm finished. Would it be in the of the speech not to have them? I would also say that it beautifies the landscape.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Really. It's like having lights on a Christmas tree with gifts. It because. Beautiful. Well, having a picture framed. Yeah, it's beautiful. Surely the Japanese and those in Las Vegas have learned this virtue. And that night, their streets are left with billboards that are quite beautiful and gorgeous to behold.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also, it would be to our advantage to see to for the rest of the public to see that we are really concerned with business and what makes business works. These billboards would be advanced and also be business oriented.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They provide information. They are a virtue, not a defect, like some socialists might maintain who put a damper on business to attain the so-called public good. Well, it isn't. I would also like to say that this is a cue, Mr. O'Donnell, that when I spoke earlier about about having an advertisement film for a production company, film production'",
        "'speaker_7': 'companies might be amended to say that a film should be made a half an hour film made but provided with things that would make it memorable. Like Sharman and Champagne, they'll enjoy it and also go along with enlightenment in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, and what is conformity? What is a billboard? It doesn't conform.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Tim Fox. Same with CBS Outdoor based in Los Angeles. Thank you for your time. First, I want to thank staff. As you guys know, it's been a long process and a lot of work has been done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a few concerns about the proposed ordinance as it is. I have a letter I'll submit for the record, but the brief synopsis of it is the first issue in table 54 one. I believe the correct was there are some spacing issues that we would like to address.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The industry standard in most cities is different than what is stated in the table, and we think that if we could address that and bring in an industry standard which would be approximately 500 feet between what we call posters and a thousand feet between digital signs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's basically the Caltrans code, but it just maybe a little more clarification. And there is also no spacing entered in one of the boxes if you were going to take an existing sign and expand it. And there was another provision within the proposed ordinance that we're concerned about where if a our company is one of them, we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do have inventory within the city that we could use to take down and build digital or convert. There is a requirement that all of the removals have to occur before we're allowed to build a sign. We would hope there would be some discussion on the ability to perhaps build the sign, not turn it on, and then we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'could do the removals just for some protections to make sure that we don't lose the rights to existing signs. I know that was addressed a little bit in the ordinance, but just maybe some more protection, that type of thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Other than that, we're happy to move along with the ordinance, you know, and have if you have questions, we'd be happy to answer. But thank you again for all your help.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council members. My name is Mike Murchison. I'm here on behalf of Regency. I want to clear up some issues on the subsection that was discussed here a minute ago. The purpose and intent, as I recall from the city council three years ago, was to focus on those billboards that were in the residential communities'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Subsection C deals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Strictly with freeway billboards that are within the landscape.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Area of 660 feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nothing but that. So we're talking about very few billboards.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very few faces. In the faces that Councilmember Neal is referring to are five faces that if subsection C was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Left in, there would be deferred.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Non-Conforming. Now, what does it mean when they're deemed non-conforming?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What it means is, is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That you got to go through a cap and trade program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So everybody's on board with cap and trade. So 4 to 1 ratio, I'm talking about five faces. So on a 41 ratio, if I've got five faces, then I'm gone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in fact, in that particular instance, Regency is wiped out of half of their inventory in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So are you in a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Position tonight that you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Don't want to take out one subsection C an impact half the inventory of the company here in the city of Long Beach? I don't think so. Your purpose here is to vote on an issue that has to do with the billboards are in a residential community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The ones we're talking about, the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Freeways have never been discussed. Never had opposition. No comments that I'm aware of by any residents here in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Furthermore, we're not talking about replacing them with digital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're talking about just leaving them alone. The reason why Regency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Has these five faces.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is because they had these billboards here longer than state law. They were grandfathered in. I understand where staff's coming from. I understand the fact that they want to be on the same page with state law. That makes perfect sense to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unfortunately, that one sentence in subsection C will basically take half of the inventory out of what Regency currently has and does very well with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think that's your intent tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I thought your intent tonight from the last three years of going through this was to focus on the cap and trade program in a residential area with all the billboards are in the residence and what their concerns are not on billboards that nobody really comments about that are on the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I respectfully request that you consider subsection C all over again to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Remove it and get clarification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the specific impact of that language. It's one sentence. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. The public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very good. You? I'm always afraid of the creeping crud. I would suggest it. They've got those. The five billboards that the previous speaker just referenced, that you put in language that if those ever do go digital. Each one will be at a cost of $1,000,000 a month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which would flow to the city. I don't like to use digital billboards. I've seen what happened up and in L.A. and the creeping crud and I can just see in a matter of it wouldn't be too too long one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Eventually they would be coming in, marching right down into neighborhoods. So restructure the language. So you make it very clear that there exists no conditions under which any digital billboard would be allowed, be it on near the signs that it's on city property or within the city of Long Beach, whether it be near the freeway or in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a city that you don't want it. But if, in fact, it does happen. Million dollars per board per month. Thank you. And if you can't figure out what to do with $1,000,000 per boy per month, let me know and I'll show you where the money can best be used.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. Council members Victor Dela Cruz with Manatt, Phelps and Phillips on land use council to Regency Outdoor Advertising. I just want to follow up on what Mike Murchison had said. The ordinance, as it's currently crafted, has four different types of non-conforming billboards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have the billboards that are located in residential areas, in plan development districts, all those areas where we don't want billboards to. There are the billboards that are on local streets exactly where you want to remove the billboards from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Three There are the landscape freeway segments, the areas that frankly, nobody cares about. These are freeway oriented billboards that don't disturb residential neighborhoods at all. And then four, there are those billboards that are on rooftops. Those are the non-conforming signs we would like to do is to have subsection C removed because those particular billboards, one, don't disturb'",
        "'speaker_4': 'any residential neighborhoods and don't hurt the integrity of of our residential neighborhoods. Second, it's important to realize that these billboards on the four or five, we may talk about the integrity of the ordinance and the fact that there's somehow going to be a strong incentive to remove billboards on freeways to participate in the cap and trade.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can assure you that no billboard company is going to remove a single freeway off of the 405 as part of this program. They are way too valuable. These are the cream of the crop of the billboards. And unless if subsection C is not removed, what you would be forcing Regency to do is to take down its'",
        "'speaker_4': 'freeway, its freeway oriented signs on the four or five, its most valuable signs in order to be able to participate in the digital program. You may recall that at the last council meeting you directed staff to include development agreement language for those companies that could not participate in the cap and trade program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we'd like to thank staff for working with us to incorporate that language. That language is in there. But unfortunately, because of subsection C, we would be precluded from participating in the development agreement process. What we're asking for is if we want to convert any of these billboards on freeways to digital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would then go through a whole process of planning, commission planning, commission review, city council review in exchange for significant public benefits for the city and revenue. And you could choose to approve those digital conversions or not. We would still have to go through a very long process, but we would just ask you to remove subsection C'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so that Regency can participate in this program, just like all of the other billboard companies. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Councilmember DeLong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the speakers talked about the the permit process and when the the non-conforming signs would be taken down. And could staff elaborate on that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly we did realize that this was be an issue the last time around, and we have tried to write the ordinance that would provide some level of protection to the to the applicant. We do have a requirement that when they get a a C up and a copy is being processed, the Billboard company has to provide us'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with a list of non-conforming billboards that they intend to remove as part of this cap and trade program. They get to determine which ones they want to put forth in terms of which ones they want to take down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a package that would be part of their c u p permit. But in order to assure that a billboard does not get constructed or converted, we are going to require that the removal does happen of those non-conforming billboards.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The assurances that we have provided is that the c u p, the one year vesting period of the c p is delayed or extended until such time that that bill, that last non-conforming billboard is removed, that they still have a full year under their c p to implement the electronic billboard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is grave concerns that allowing somebody to essentially build a house and let them move their furniture in, but don't let them live there that they're going to, you know, end up living there when our back is turned.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we do have grave concerns that if we structure it in any other way, that the billboard company will effect effectively flip the switch and that the electronics will commence and we will have no authority to to get them to remove the non-conforming billboards.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So but we're in the process. Do the old billboards come down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'After they have been granted ACP by the Planning Commission? They apply for a demolition permits. They can certainly get building permits plan checked, but they don't get to have the building permit for the new electronic billboard until after the demolition of the old billboards are complete.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I guess my concern is maybe if I own that business, I wouldn't want to turn off all my revenue for X period of time before I had the new revenue coming in. And I guess what I like to propose and you can tell me what truck and would you see is I don't know why we wouldn't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do it. More like a certificate of occupancy that will let you build the new board. But you can't occupy you can't activate it until the old billboards are down. And while I understand your concern that somebody might violate that regulation and turn it on, that we need to have a strict enforcement penalty, and I know it's a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'thousand bucks a day or, you know, do something that's extraordinarily painful, that if you turn on that sign before the old ones are removed, it's going to cost you dearly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm pretty sure we would not have a high enough citation that would accommodate that. $1,000 a day to an electronic billboard is really not a lot of money. Our issue is, you know, consistency with how we treat the building code across all land uses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do not allow occupancy until all requirements are met. And so we are very firm on this. This position.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kind of give me give me an example of that. When you say what's like a billboard, do you tear something down? And then you might have multi-month before you put something up and you lose your revenue in the meantime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Give me an example of something that's similar in the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll give you an example of somebody who's not supposed to demolish a partial house in a in a while. They're waiting for their local coastal development permit and they still do it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, but they didn't lose revenue. In the meanwhile, we enforce them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Maybe they had rental income that that they ended up kicking out and then we've extended and delayed the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. But that's completely different. That's that's where that building owner chose illegally. But that building owner chose to to move those tenants out and lose revenue. Show me an example where the city is insisting you lose revenue off the existing operation for a period of time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think it's an issue of revenue for us. It's a it's a the perspective of you don't get to have the vested right or the opportunity until you have complied. And so there's there's no creative way that we can come up with to demonstrate that they're going to comply and remove their billboards in order to get'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the right that we are granting them for the electronics. It is a privilege that we are giving them to to allow them to convert to electronics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's the difference between us. You know, when you say you don't look at the revenue perspective, you're not looking at it from the customer's perspective. They're a customers of the city. So I think we do need to give them the ability to get everything up and running, but they cannot turn it on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They can't occupy it right until they meet that. And then there needs to be some kind of a stiff penalty or some other action. And maybe, you know, we start a process, we have to take it down or something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't know. I think we get here in a different way. And I also think that if a a billboard company tries to challenge us, challenge us and do something illegal, they're going to find it very difficult to continue to do business in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let's let it percolate a little more. But I'm going to come back with a substitute or friendly amendment on this issue before we close it out. But could you also comment on the item regarding the number of feet, the 500 feet, a thousand feet that the gentleman referred to and what our requirements are and which ones'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are both confirmed to the state?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So one of the gentlemen talked about that. I guess in the language, it's 500 feet, maybe for some billboard, a thousand feet for a digital billboard, but that doesn't conform with what state code is. Can you elaborate on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or if not, we'll have the gentleman come back up and asked the question again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're actually being more liberal than the state. We are allowing boards within 300 feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Could you the gentleman that's a question for you. Could you come back up so we could resolve that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tim Fox, CBS Outdoor. I'll read the paragraph I put together. Make it hopefully more clear. Sorry about that. Another issue of concern is in table 54, dash one as it relates to spacing between billboards. The city's proposed spacing is a minimum of 300 feet or Caltrans requirements as they are on the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Most, if not all, cities require a spacing distance of 600 feet between larger non digital 672 square feet, what we call bulletins, billboards and 300 feet minimum, sometimes 500 feet, depending on the city. Between the smaller, non-digital, 300 square feet or less.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Billboards. Those are called posters. There is also no spacing requirement noted for the enlargement of an existing sign, or at least the way we interpreted the the the table. We would propose that the city adopt the spacing of 600 feet between non-digital billboards, between the size of 300 to 672 square feet, which is a poster in a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'bulletin. A minimum of 300 feet between billboards, 300 feet or less, and a minimum of 1000 feet between all digital billboards. That's just a proposal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So how does that compare to what staff are recommending at other cities?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, on on on the electronics, we are much more liberal. We are suggesting a minimum of 300 feet. The speaker just said a thousand feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I still believe that we're being more liberal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, I'm finished for now. But maybe before this comes back, I say I'm going to ask for either friendly or a substitute to address the the permit issue. So perhaps you could give some thought to see if there is any other approach that might be satisfactory to both of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilor Johnson Well, thank you, Vice Mayor, but one of the speakers had mentioned about the non-performing billboards along the freeway and the desire to keep them static. If there were a static billboard along a freeway and the ordinance were to pass as proposed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would that still be allowed to exist?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. It would be allowed to exist in its current state, and if the company wished to convert it, that would be allowed if it if that company had Caltrans credits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So basically illegal non-conforming, it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Would remain illegal non-conforming that would be allowed to remain in its static position.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Controversy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Gypsy But I think in following that up, if I understood Mr. Murchison, I think the issue is the the face requirement. It's not just that they should be allowed to continue there, but maybe if you clarify that a little bit more about when he mentioned five, five faces and that if you were to convert, that you lose'",
        "'speaker_6': ', is that correct? You lose your inventory. That doesn't make sense. That's not seems to be our intent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our intent is to remove non-conforming billboards throughout the city. We did not look at one company's inventory over another company's inventory. We kept this at a very neutral level where we did not get into qualifications and scenarios of what billboard would be converted and what building would not be converted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We did instead look at opportunities and granting the privilege of converting to electronic. There is a mechanism for all billboard companies to work with the other billboard companies to remove non-conforming billboards within the city. This ordinance does not limit a company from only removing nonconforming billboards within its own inventory.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In fact, it it provides an incentive that when all nonconforming billboards are removed, the conversion is at a 1 to 1 ratio instead of 8 to 1 or 6 to 1 or 4 to 1. So we do stand by the position that this company in particular could continue to maintain its static billboard on the four or five'",
        "'speaker_8': 'freeway. It could continue to pursue conversion through the receipt of Caltrans credits. And if it wishes to convert to to electronic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Keep that can you or Mr. Chair if we could have the individual who brought that up, could you clarify what their concern focuses on about the five faces and, you know, obliterate the inventory? And I understand that we're not focusing on a particular company, but I think when a business comes and says, if we do this, we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'lose our inventory.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I do not believe that this is the only company that would be required to remove billboards in order to get the benefit of electronics.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I didn't suggest that. But could we just get clarification? I mean, does that that's kind of an onerous thing to be presenting to the councilman? I need to understand a little bit more before I take a vote.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm going to go and have customer ships. If you can, please answer the councilmembers question on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So Regency has nine total billboard structures in the city, and they're all on freeways. All of the other companies have significantly larger inventories, but their billboards are, to a great extent, located in residential neighborhoods, on local streets, precisely the sorts of billboards that the city wants to come down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Relatively speaking, the terms that the value of freeway adjacent billboards verses the value of billboards that are located on residential streets where you don't have nearly as much traffic. It's it's it's it's apples and oranges. So if if subsection C were to remain Regency in order to convert one of its billboards to digital would have to take'",
        "'speaker_4': 'down four of its extremely valuable billboard faces on freeways. And those billboards don't really bother anybody because they're not in residential neighborhoods. And if I recall correctly, when stat when staff was asked to include a development agreement option, it was precisely to deal with this situation and the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Language right now allows a company to negotiate a development agreement for digital conversions if it can show that it is infeasible for them to take down enough nonconforming billboards. Unfortunately, because of that, because of that language, if if if our billboards on freeways are deemed non-conforming, then Regency might be in a position where it won't be able'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to negotiate a development agreement. So all we're asking for is the ability to participate in the digital conversion process by coming to the city, because it isn't feasible to take down our structures and we would negotiate a certain dollar amount and other community benefits as part of that development agreement that would go through planning commission and city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'council review. But does does that does that make sense in terms of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I understand that. And my my understanding I misspoke. I thought the council had asked staff to see if there was a possibility of being able to do that in lieu of coming up with some kind of cash in lieu of having to take them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do have the ability and it is written in here to enter into development agreements. We do not set the negotiated positions because that would be based on individual negotiations of a development agreement. It is not an either or situation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You can't just walk in and ask for a development agreement in order to convert to electronics. You have to demonstrate, as Mr. de la Cruz mentioned, in feasibility to convert to electronics because you don't have enough inventory or because you are unable to come up with a cooperative relationship with somebody else who may have a lot of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'inventory. Those are all legitimate grounds for determining that it is infeasible for them to come to do additional takedowns. And so we do include language that allows them to enter into negotiations, but does not but does not guarantee, you know, a development agreement based on on specific parameters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We awareness park and other cities that have done this. Is this is this the framework in which they've handled this situation? That's my first question. Second question is, how many other freeway billboards are we talking about in the city?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're talking about, I believe, nine.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do have we are familiar with a number of other cities that do have development agreements for billboards. Each of them have their own unique terms because they are, you know, specific to those cities. West Hollywood industry are a couple of those cities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do have I want to make it clear that there are nine structures that Regency owns, but there are 15 phases. And I think that that's what Mr. De La Cruz was referring to, that he had five places on the four or five, but I think that only equates to three locations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'According to this map, you know, probably 20 billboards within the freeway landscape by far along the four or five freeway that would be potentially impacted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So help me on that. So for these other entities, if they were to want to convert, they could take their inventories in other parts of the town and take those down and then convert along the freeway to electronic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No. Along the 405 freeway, no. Along other parts of the freeway, like the 710 freeway where there is no landscape buffer. Yes. So we are talking about 20 billboards that exist in a legal non-conforming state right now. And so none of those 20 would be allowed to convert to digital along the four or five freeway, but they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'would be allowed to remain as nonconforming billboards. And and, you know, and they would also be allowed to convert to electronics through the use of Caltrans credits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just to add to that, if if we take these billboards out of the equation, I think one of the important things to understand is what is. So let's picture the future of the that the billboard landscape in Long Beach right after this ordinance is passed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's going to end up happening is that all of the billboard companies will do a will will take down their significantly less valuable billboards on residential and local streets. And you're going to see applications as part of a cap and trade program to convert the billboards that that are not in landscaped areas into digitals and regency would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also like the opportunity to be able to do that. And the only way that the only way that it would be able to do that is if if if those billboards that it has right now are not factored into the calculation of what is non-conforming only for purposes of removal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because of the ordinance, the billboards would still be non-conforming under the ordinance. We're just address addressing subsection C for purposes of removal, which leads to the question of whether a billboard company would then be able to negotiate a development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it doesn't really it doesn't really radically change the equation at all.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think I think it conservatorships go very.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Quickly when I'm understanding from this photo it does not preclude them coming to try to negotiate. That seems to be the crux of the question. Does that subsection preclude them from negotiating with the city or does it maybe the city attorney can opine on this since you wrote it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They have to demonstrate technical enforceability in order to come to us for a development agreement. So that means that the non-conforming billboards, you know, are infeasible for them to remove regardless of who owns it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, but have we defined what their responsibility includes in terms for an argument?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have not. We have been very, very careful about being very narrow in in what, you know, what we're putting in there for in terms of terms for a development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And again, I want to clarify, though, that they would be, Mr. Mayes, that you can address because that they would be able to negotiate with the city, obviously, considering whether or not they can make an argument about enforceability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The difficulty they had and I think this is what Mr. De La Cruz has articulated trying to articulate, is that they would have a non-conforming billboard in place. And the overall arching goal of this ordinance is to remove non-conforming billboards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If the current language remains, they could come to the city and try to negotiate with a development agreement or for a development agreement. But we would say you have a non-conforming billboard that you can remove. So how? There's nothing that would preclude them from removing it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So how do they demonstrate in feasibility? It wouldn't simply be because it doesn't make economic sense for them to do. It would have to be something more. And what the ordinance envisions in feasibility to be is a situation where a company simply has no.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For instance, if a company came to the city and had no billboards in place, obviously they have nothing to take down. So they could demonstrate that it would be infeasible to for them to participate in cap and trade so they would be eligible, presumably to do a development agreement if they did not have a number.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's say the number is they need to remove six in order to participate in cap and trade. If they said to us, yeah, but our inventory is only four, well obviously they can't remove six. So we would say, well, remove four, who will waive the other two and you can participate in a development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or the other alternative is that the ordinance envisions is that a company, this is another possibility has no current inventory. They could acquire inventory or partner with another company that has current inventory in the city to take those five down or whatever the number is they're going to be taking down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then they could participate in the cap and trade and build a new electronic billboard someplace else. So it does provide flexibility, but Mr. De La Cruz is correct under their particular scenario. If that if the language remains the same, they most likely would not be able to participate in a development agreement because they could not demonstrate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in feasibility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And let me ask, is there a way that we can. Struck some alternate language that protects the integrity of the intent of removing nonconforming but understanding that we've got a smaller business entity in the city so small but a an entity that doesn't have I mean, whose inventory is restricted in that particular case, what it kind of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'makes it difficult.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's really no way to do that because as Ms.. Black indicated, we didn't look, we can't treat each company differently. Their billboard is just as non-conforming as other companies billboards along the freeway. So that really can't make that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can remove it altogether as a requirement, which is what he's requesting. And that would what.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Would that do to them? The overall ordinance, if you remove that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Substitution, if you remove that, then those billboards would no longer be considered nonconforming. And so then they wouldn't have to use that as part of the equation. They would be able to come in and say, Well, we don't have any non-conforming billboards along the freeway, therefore we want a development agreement with you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Does that make sense? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, it does. It just it's it seems to be particularly onerous on I know, you know, singling out a business, but we have a situation because we're developing an ordinance, putting it on top of an existing situation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is and I think that's why we put the provision in there, not just specifically for this company, but for a situation that would still allow somebody like this to participate. In other words, if they had credits from somewhere else, Caltrans credits from someplace else in the state, they could use those credits to convert that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. They could use them locally. So if you have credits in another area, they can be used here under this under this ordinance. Okay. Well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm going to I'm going to move on to the next council members cued up. Councilman DeLong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Two questions, Mr. Mason. You know, you've talked about a feasibility and you said it doesn't include economic and feasibility. Could it or could they say, look, this is making it 4 to 1, just doesn't pencil?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it maybe I was too strong on that. I mean, in theory, the way the ordinance is written, it could I'm just saying, practically speaking, you know, going through the planning commission, the city council, it may be difficult to make the argument that, you know, finances alone make it infeasible, because in theory, everyone could make that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'argument. But the the the development agreement section is broad enough. It's possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, everybody could make that argument. I think it's going to resonate more along a freeway, high profile billboards. I mean, I do see that going to be a significantly higher value there than there would be something that's in a residential neighborhood that has a much lower traffic count, etc..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I do think there's a an argument to be made. The second question I had is so these billboards that we're discussing now to today without the without a new ordinance, but the existing one, are they.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Illegal, legal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Legal, non-conforming? What is their classification?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Today, under our ordinance and under state law, they would be considered legal non-conforming. They were all the ones we're talking about were all built before Caltrans implemented their landscape freeway design guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And in the new ordinance, they'll still be legal non-conforming.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no requirement under the new ordinance that anything be removed unless someone wants to participate voluntarily in a cap and trade so they can stay there indefinitely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess the the if it's possible to do it, the only I would like to see is, you know, the last time we talked about this, what we were desirous of is trying to get staff the flexibility of negotiating development agreements when the formula just wouldn't work for whatever reason, whether it be technical, would it be lack'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of inventory, whether it be economic feasibility, whatever. But to have that and then candidly, you know, we're hoping to hold staff accountable that you're going to negotiate the appropriate deal. And, you know, they're going to have to justify to your satisfaction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And ultimately the council's through a copy process that it makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So and I believe that we've built that flexibility in there. The section that we'd be talking about is section 21, 54, 112. And if you have the draft ordinance, that would be on page three, that line 14.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it simply says in the event that an applicant, applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and the City Council that it is infeasible to comply with the provisions of Section 2154 160, which is the removal cap and trade related to the removal of nonconforming.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or boards. An applicant shall then be eligible to apply for a development agreement in accordance with Chapter 2129, which is our development agreement section.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess the major rhetorical question there, one, am I missing if if there is the ability to handle this situation and the proposed ordinance, I guess it's not clear to me why I changed anything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think what Mr. De La Cruz would say is that in a hyper technical sense, he I'm guessing he probably agrees with me that it would be difficult, practically speaking, to prove in feasibility if the only argument is I'm going to lose some money by not taking down this billboard on the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That may that might be a hard sell in the community for and feasibility. And I think he wants more assurance or more certainty that they could participate in the development agreement without having to take down those billboards that have that they own specifically and adjacent to their freeway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess while you can't predict the outcome, I guess what I would hope is that, you know, staff renegotiate the best deal they could with us for moving one or two or three. If it's something less than four, there's some number in there that makes economic sense for the for the business to go to digital.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yet the city has gotten the best deal that it can, you know, for us and our residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't want to speak for Regency, but I think Regency has said that they would not be interested in taking down any of those freeway billboards that they own as part of a cap and trade, even in the development agreement scenario.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some question.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Dylan can ask a question if you'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to ask that question.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you could address that, because clearly that would seem a bit rigid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To me if you had the ability to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's practically almost all our inventory to be able to participate in. And it's a very it's there particularly valuable billboards. But the reason I've been kind of scurrying up here and trying to get something in, which is I'm hearing that there's a little bit of hesitation to remove subsection C.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to also propose another alternative that I think would do the job very simply through the through the insertion of some additional language. If you look at the section 21.5, 4.1 12, which deals with development agreements, it says in the event that an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and the City Council that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it is infeasible to comply with the provisions related to the removal of nonconforming billboards. We could add some language saying excluding the removal of billboards in landscape buffer areas, then the applicant shall be eligible to apply for development agreements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that that solves the problem quite, quite, quite simply.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello, Mr. Mays. Do you want to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Opine on that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I guess it has the exact same effect of removing subsection D, so it's really a policy decision of the council. And if it's council's desire to allow those billboards that currently exist adjacent to the freeway that are non-conforming to stay, then it's just too simple to remove subsection C as it is to try and fool around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with the development agreement language. It has the same effect either way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess. You know, just speaking for myself, I mean, I'm supportive of staff negotiating a deal with that business and having the confidence and staff that, you know, they're going to extract something from those signs. And I would imagine if the company said, listen, we're not going to give anything, we're not giving a single sign, nothing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All we want is new. My hunch is staff isn't going to go for that deal. Hopefully I have the confidence and you know, if we can figure out how to direct this or they can go through the development agreement process and they still got to go through the planning commission, they still got to go through copy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, there are a number of hurdles that they're going to have to go through to make their case. I don't mind giving them the ability to make the case. No more. It takes us out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But one of the things Ms.. Boda suggested is that we could change it. We couldn't do it tonight, but we could bring it back next week at second reading because you can't do this on the fly. But you could change the development agreement language to require specifically that as part of any development agreement that at least one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'billboard be removed. I don't know if that meets region C's concerns. Probably not, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I don't. I mean, I'd I personally be concerned about a number that is as as low as the floor likes. I want to give staff some flexibility about it. I don't want to be arbitrary, but I guess another perhaps way to do it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I say you couldn't do that tonight anyways. May we pass the ordinance as it is? We've we've taken a bite at this apple every once in a while and keep working this issue for another 30 or 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if we have to come back with another small tweak, do it at that time and maybe not not try and do it tonight, since it doesn't at least I'm not sensing any consensus here of what the best move forward is, other than a desire to to be open to a change in agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, I see a few nods there so I'll, I'll relinquish the mic, but that would be where I think we ought to go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What is motion say right now?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Johnson's motion is on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can't have accountability until next year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just briefly, I would support what Councilmember DeLong proposed just now. It's come back with that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is if I'm saying this correctly, what we have is we have a motion on the floor by Councilman Johnson to move the staff recommendation forward, but also with the understanding that we would possibly get additional information or some options on this one piece that's in discussion right now on this on the section.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. Johnson, are we okay with that? And that and that additional information on this one piece could come as soon as the second reading. Is that what I'm hearing also from Mr. DeLong.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would probably wouldn't bring it back at second reading. I think what Mr. DeLong was proposing, if I understood it, was just to pass it as is, which was Mr. Johnson's motion. And then at a later date, if council wants to take it up again, as you have this time, to insert something that would give more flexibility to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'staff after we had a reasoned opportunity to look at it, you could certainly amend like any ordinance amended at any time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I guess what I see as part of this is we're directing staff tonight. You know, they come back in 30 days with a recommendation for how to tweak it again, if they have it or whatever a reasonable period of time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's I think I think what we're doing is asking for a proactive that it would come back to us, that that piece of it is a correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, it could be a heck of a memo. It could be rescheduling through the council. But yeah, give a time certain. And you know, Amy, if you can comment on how much time you think you'd need to to address that issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Could you give me 60 days?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Get 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_8': '60 days from the effective date of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How about 60 days after second reading?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we try it out. We actually do need to vote on this because there's the ordinance and then there's a resolution referring it to the Coastal Commission. So we will need a second vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And I still have the other issue, Vice Mayor, but if there's other people cued up with something, go to them too and I'll come back at the end.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Conservatorships keep my question would be the staff. I know it was immediately shot down, but could staff give its reasoning why, if we were looking for an alternative that you offered that alternative of, they would have to replace at least one billboard if we get some.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just quickly the thinking behind that, because I don't think we you know, it was like, no, no, we want to do that. What was the reason for that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The intent of the ordinance is to remove billboards. If the development agreement does not address that intent of the ordinance, then, you know, that really should be the basis of where negotiations start. And so we would suggest that for any development agreement that would be negotiated related to billboards, that it starts with the basis that there has'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to be some removal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I would think that I think what Mr. DeLong said then is just a little bit more on point, and is that I think that's the intent of the ordinance is to do that. But staff should have the flexibility to figure out how that can be negotiated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do agree with them. Also, I think that we'd all have a hard time supporting, you know, an adamant refusal not to remove any to be able to do that. So I think while you've indicated one, I think the intent of the ordinance is very clear is to remove.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She removed Billboard. So I would feel comfortable that, you know, having staff, being able to negotiate what that entails and how that's done would be sufficient to follow through the intent. And if we can, Mr. Chair, just quickly, because we had this whole issue has been about them and they seem to be waving about.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, I know. As long as they have a question, customer ships keep going.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What was your.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our our our big concern is just the nature of the billboard industry and what will happen if you move forward with this chunk of the ordinance and you leave us laying out there for for for 60 days.

They will go to property, and they will go to property owners and say, we have the right to enter into into agreements with these property owners for digital billboards. Regency does not.

It would just basically say that, yes, Regency may have non-conforming billboards and freeways on freeways, but despite that, they can still negotiate a development agreement.

        "'speaker_5': 'I apologize to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city attorney, but I do have concerns about that. And so if this is a the direction that the city council wishes to go, I would ask that there be in place a cash bond for each of the billboards that was supposed to have been removed but didn't get removed before the electronics were turned on.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'That language on second reading, you may want to discuss again what significant is, but we'll come up with the number that we think is appropriate and then we can debate that number if we need to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, no, that's fine, Mary, to just just make it be careful that you don't make it so outrageously expensive to post the bond that it defeats the entire purpose that nobody does it. So let's just come up with an appropriate price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to state that this is a very lucrative business. The conversion of billboards to electronics provides immense revenues and is of significant benefit to all of the companies who have inventory within the city. So I don't know what your realm of significance is, but it's in my realm, it's clearly more than $1,000.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'The state of California, under the direction of the state fire marshal and with pressure from the fireworks industry, enabled local municipalities the ability to approve for sale, use and possession state approved fireworks. These fireworks have been branded as safe and sane, but the slogan is far from the truth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fact, it is important to note that the term safe and sane was created by the fireworks industry to give the impression of safety. The term is merely a marketing ploy, and the truth is that no fireworks or any other incendiary device are safe or sane.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To illustrate my point, we all agree that we should not give matches to children to play with. In fact, the fire service across the nation has repeatedly educated school age children about the dangers of playing with matches. A lit match burns at 600 degrees Fahrenheit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A single lit match in the hands of a child or irresponsible adult can cause tremendous damage to property and to the health and well-being of people. To put this into perspective, a so-called safe and sane sparkler that are sold at corner fireworks stands when lit burns at 1600 to 1800 degrees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's nearly three times slaughtered in a lit match. And as many of us know, a lit sparkler will continue to burn until the available fuel sources depleted in a situation that deteriorates from festive to dangerous. One cannot just blow out the flame.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Light can be done with a match. In 2012, 9600 fireworks related injuries were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms. The trend in fireworks related injuries has been mostly in the range of 8500 to 9800 emergency room visits since 97, with the exception of spikes in 2000, which primarily coincides with the new millennium.'",

Eight out of nine or 89% of the emergency room visits for fireworks injuries involve fireworks that the federal government permit consumers to use.'",

In 2007 to 2012, four people per year were killed by fireworks. While the data from death certificates show that five people per year were killed by will, killed directly by the fireworks themselves.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, these estimates may overlap a little bit because fireworks can actually kill somebody and also start a fatal fire in 2000 or using 2000 to 2010 data. The risk of fire death relative to hours of usage is higher for fireworks than for Cigarets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cigarets are often cited as a primary contributing factor to residential structure fires in the United States each year. But this data shows clearly that fireworks pose a greater threat than a lit cigaret in the promotion of fire on Independence Day.'",

The mere fact that every city surrounding Long Beach, Carson, Compton, Bellflower, Paramount, Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens and Wall all recognize same for same fireworks is legal access.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is is is isn't really not the question here because our residents are buying these these fireworks. The marketing ploy that you have alluded to regarding safe and sane fireworks. Well, I'm looking at the California state code 12 599, which clearly has certain same fireworks time of sale.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's recognized by the California state legislature and by California law. And what is the does it work in surrounding communities? I'm not hearing about major issues in any surrounding cities where public safety or is being extremely stressed. I haven't heard any data from you to give us any any sense that we are using mutual aid to to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'address or respond to any of these other cities in their emergency needs during the 4th of July. And it just and understand your job is is public safety and to to to advise us and trust me, I'm taking your advice very seriously and under deep consideration.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But at the same time, I think there's there's still something missing because it's all around us. And our residents have full access. Our police officers don't have and aren't really, I don't think, interested in really enforcing this. I think it's a public relations problem when, you know, our police officers are responding to a block party where you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have a family lighting off, say, safe, and seeing fireworks and citing a family. But two blocks away, you know, they're laying off inmates and they're there there's there's it seems like the the the policy is really relatively discriminatory in terms of how we go about in arbitrary about where we we are we site and where we enforce'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the the fireworks ban or yeah, the fireworks ban altogether here in the city. So this, I think, is is something that that merits our discussion. And again, the question I guess I would have to you is, would you have a problem stating those points to the voters of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, if this came before the ballot, these would be obviously great points to to consider for our voters to consider. The question is not whether or not fireworks are dangerous or or risky. I think that's pretty much known.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that's the case. But but the question is whether or not the city of Long Beach should recognize safety, same fireworks as other cities around us do. I mean, all of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Let me let me just respond a couple of things, Mr. Dawson. First of all, the city of Los Angeles does not allow fireworks right now. So big cities, a lot of big cities don't allow it. And, you know, to me, if you want to allow it, just put an ordinance together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't want to waste money putting this on the ballot. How much does it cost to put these on the ballot?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For two measures, we estimated about 135,000. You can split that in half depending on the pages of each.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, if you if you if you if you really believe in it, put an audience together. But before the council, let them vote on it. I don't think this is something that merits going to a vote of the people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And secondly, you know, you can't even play dodgeball in school anymore because of the effect on children. Mr.. Mr.. NEILL With his, with all this stuff about healthy foods, people want to eliminate big, big gulp drinks, anything over 12 ounces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You've got a big program. And I applaud you for this. In the north area. Mr.. Neill to make sure kids eat healthy. But we're going to put a 1700 degree flame in their hands.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, and see how fast they can run.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is kind of ridiculous. This isn't this is safe. This isn't safe. And it certainly is insane. It's insane. I understand. Wanting to raise money for non-profits. Mr. Ross and I got that. I mean, there's got to be better ways.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's all I would say. I just. I needed to say this. This is to me. I mean, if you believe in it, put it before the council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm glad you got that off your chest, Mr. Mayor. I like to hear from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That Mr. Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, really messed up know. So I feel like, you know, my major concern about, you know, allowing fireworks in our city limits would be a safe concern, especially in Long Beach is a much larger and divided city than any of the surrounding cities concerning, you know, currently allowing fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And like I said, you know, we're looking at a situation, especially with our young kids today. And I know if you guys have been around on the 4th of July, not only the 4th of July, we have fireworks in our community all the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not just fireworks. So what we really have to be really careful because we do want to send our kids in the wrong direction. And I know we can raise money much better for these nonprofit organizations than, you know, putting an ordinance in, but, you know, opening up fireworks in our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That, to me is a serious concern about the safety of our community and our children. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One other real difference between the cities around us. They're contract cities. They contract with the county for public safety services. You'll notice that the cities that have their own police, fire departments, they don't. Almost all of them banned this because they directly have to pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's almost a free good for the contract cities. Somebody else has to deal with it. Mr. Dillon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Well, first of all, I'll second the motion, certainly, if we can vote on it. I do think it merits an up or down vote. I would I tell you that, Mr. Austin, that I think we should, you know, consider that maybe an ordinance might be a better approach than than the ballot, although I'm open to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to either one for further discussion. But I could see some benefits in the ordinance. It can be in case it doesn't go as well as you hope. You know, it's very easy to undo an ordinance. It's not not so easy to undo something that's been voted on on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The one of the concerns that I do have that I think could be addressed in either approach, but I would want to make sure it is is clearly there are some places in the city that it would be inappropriate to do this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know just in the third place where I could support this, the peninsula is crazy enough on July 4th, adding anything to the peninsula I could not be supportive of. So I think there needs to be some mechanism to take a look at different locations in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if it's an if it doesn't make sense to have these fireworks that we ought to be able to to zone it out, then the last thing I would say is that where there would be ordinance or ballot is we do need to have some kind of a revenue mechanism, because I do agree with Chief Tory that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there is going to be some impact on public safety and we would need to make sure that we recoup those costs in advance from the folks that are selling these things. And we need to figure out what an appropriate price would be and then cover all our public safety costs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if this public works cost of cleanup, we've got to cover those costs. So it should not cost the city anything to do this. But other than that, I'm certainly supportive of the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thanks, Mayor. I guess my first question for the city clerk is, is tonight is the deadline for putting something on the April ballot, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Mayor and members of the council, yes. Tonight is the last council meeting, January 7th, prior to the statutory.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Deadline of January 10th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And if I think one of my one of my concerns and I think Councilor Austin brings up a lot of good points and I hear your passion. So and I think you bring up a lot of good points.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And certainly I've enjoyed fireworks as a young person and even as an older person. But I guess a city clerk, if we wanted to put this on the November ballot, that would be another option as well. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You could, but I'm pretty sure it'll cost you quite a bit more because that would be consolidated. Oh, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So but then I guess I misspoke. I meant that June election next June would be a possibility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It could be on the June as well. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the next question is for the police chief. You know, Chief, I think Councilor Austin has a good point, which is, you know, we certainly have gotten calls in the past from residents who are concerned with the current ban in the sense that they say, oh, you know, everyone's laying off fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No one's do anything about it. And, you know, obviously, you have a lot of a lot of issues like crime issues. And certainly this may not be at the top of your list. So please comment on what's it like for the four P.D. on the 4th of July.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and how do you deal or how do we deal as a community with getting those calls and explain to people that we're not selectively enforcing our laws, that we're trying to be equal and typically not enforcing it in certain parts of town, anything like that, while at the same time recognizing, you know, your priority needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Thank you for the question. There is frustration on the part of the officers, as you can imagine, running from called to call for fire fireworks calls. Oftentimes, these calls will come out as a shots fired call. The officers end up responding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're believing that it's something other than what it turns out to be. It's a relief when it turns out to be fireworks. However, they have to go, assuming that it's what the call said. So from a standpoint of of complacency, that becomes an issue for us on the backside.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And looking at the number of calls for service, we anticipate that if safe and sane were sold in Long Beach, they would it would legitimize it in escalate the number of people lighting up fireworks. And while it would be legal, potentially, we still would get calls, annoyance calls, people lighting them off next door.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They let them off to close to this or whatever, not because they have possession, but because of the noise as a disturbance to the person calling. So I anticipate that with a greater number of fireworks available in the city, we would have a greater number of radio calls to respond to as far as a priority, how they're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'handled. As I mentioned, there is frustration on the part of the officers and in some areas of the city were able to get a car out there and to be able to deal with it. But most frequently, by the time the officers respond, the fireworks have been lit off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the people who let them off are gone and there's nothing but paper blowing and in the wind at the time. So it would be a workload issue from our standpoint. The fire chief laid out the safety issues and I won't go into that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But from our standpoint, much more of a workload issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Neal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Mayor, I actually appreciate the dialog and excuse me and my colleague bringing this for us to at least discuss and debate on on the validity of doing something like this. The conversation has kind of diverged into an idea, excuse me, in regards to an ordinance as opposed to a ballot initiative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't want to speak for Mr. Austin, but I believe the question he was posing was to find out if if the citizenry was even interested in going in this direction, where of us doing an ordinance would give us some control.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it may be that the citizens themselves don't have a desire to to move in that direction. So there is validity both ways. I think the fact that we have to make a decision on this tonight, whether we're going to pursue the direction as as presented on the agenda or we make a decision to look at it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as an ordinance would would definitely would buy some more time. It's something that we have to seriously consider, but I think it is a worthwhile discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Comes memberships.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or Mr.. You know the other alternative is to wait get a fuller report because I think before anything is rejected out of hand, I think it would be we haven't seen anything in writing and I've heard repeated stories about the problems in Huntington Beach and how they're very grateful that they've gotten the band off.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this still could go on if it was this sense of this council not to do an ordinance, but to go with the voters. It could go in June. I mean, it just seems like it's kind of last minute, last hour on something that has ramification in this city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You all are too young to remember. Had a horrible history with the bribing around fireworks because fireworks is big business. In fact, the councilperson for the sixth District went to jail over it and ruined a wonderful career that he had in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my beaches had some bad history with fireworks and what it brings. So I would hope we at least have we're going to do this have a little bit more discussion then on the night of whether or not we're going to put it on the ballot or do an ordinance or whatever, give us some time so they'",
        "'speaker_6': 'can be looked at. That would be that would be my call. And I would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just be the one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr.. Where would the costs be similar to do it on the June ballot?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The cost would be similar provided that there's a June runoff, which you can decide whether or not there will be one or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is is the pope Catholic?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think the mayor's race will be one out rape and the third district, there'll probably be a runoff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what will be the deadline.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For the June ballot?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I recall, it would be 88 days before June 8th. April 8th is 56 days. So somewhere around some around the end of March.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, two months from now. Right. Because April to June goes back, two months of this date would be moved back two months.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So would you guys be open to changing this motion to to to put in an advisory vote before the voters in June?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, the strategy is analyze the potential revenues would be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The interview. Well, I'm certainly open to that. But but if we have almost two months, is there any more information that we can get? Can we have a suggestion for staff on what the fees ought to be and how much revenue we would need to generate?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could we could we get any additional information on any problems and maybe no problems for Lakewood in the surrounding cities that you mentioned? Is there an opportunity to collect a little more information? But but I'm fine with heading in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then one clarification is so would the ballot item be that the citizens would vote whether or not to give the council direction to then go develop an ordinance to basically.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, it's that. It's an advisory question of shall we? Shall we not? Yes or no? If the majority of voters says yes, that gives the council direction to to then start crafting an ordinance. And I mean, this is just square one right now, to be quite honest with you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So I mean, if if I guess if truly, our our worst case scenario is that we spend $65,000 and the citizens vote no. All right. Well, I would like to have a little more information if possible, but I think shooting for the June ballot, I certainly feel more comfortable with an April.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Parker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You may remember the City Council as proposed by Council member Austin. The advisory vote would be non-binding on the council, of course, so they could come back, and if the citizens were inclined to favor fireworks, the council would still be free to decline or not to adopt an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But cancel memberships keep. All right. We have any public comment on this. Any member of the public. Please identify yourself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Dennis Dunne. Let the kids have some fun. Fireworks are fun. I enjoyed them. My family supervised it and loved to see the smile on my face as I burned down a little cabin without sparkling. So the chief is grasping at straws, is particularly noted when he says, I couldn't believe it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Domestic terrorism is caused by fireworks. It's inspiration in that direction. I think that possibly maybe we should ban turkeys because we might get burned face Thanksgiving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's why you can't play dodgeball. You might get hit in the head.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can we put.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That on the agenda next week, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. We have any.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Mayor. Well, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is actually what I came down for and waited all this time, so. Yes. Good evening again. I drove through Lakewood where fireworks are allowed on July 4th last year. It was an absolute war zone. The air was thick with smoke, dogs barking relentlessly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Many of the streets were filled with people shooting off large fireworks in the aftermath. The streets and parks were absolutely littered with spent rockets and other trash. Our resources are already stretched to the max, according to public safety sources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How many fires will be started? How many homes destroyed? How many injuries will require paramedics? How many asthmatic will experience life threatening breathing problems because of the gross air pollution? How many parents will be frightened or harmed? How many irresponsible people will cause damage to their neighbors property?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Who will be available to handle these situations? Are the groups that would profit from the sale of these fireworks going to pay for all these extra expenses of the city for public safety? Will they pay for the damages to property?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How do they plan to atone for the loss of a child die or the heartbreak of losing a pet, or even the loss of somebody's life in a fire? Will they be cleaning up all the trash that's left behind, or are they willing to shoulder this responsibility?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The state is experiencing one of the most one of the worst droughts in history, a powder keg for wildfire. A single burning ember can travel the distance of a mile. Don't we have enough of a mess? From the Queen Mary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fireworks, visitors without adding more problems. All things considered, the city council needs to put this issue to bed and continue the ban. It's the only safe and sane thing to do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And excuse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor. Members of the City Council staff. My name is John Kelly, Vice President, TNT Fireworks. 555 North Gilbert Street in Fullerton. As you consider your decision this evening on 14, I'm here to provide you with a brief snapshot of the fireworks industry in California and in L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the 46 states that currently allow consumer fireworks, the most restrictive state law is, yes, California. Safe and sane, as defined in the California Health and Safety Code, have been legal in California. The elders in my tribe told me since the forties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we are the toes, the forties and all kinds of numbers. Take your pick. All products are tested and approved by the California State Fire Marshal before they can be sold. They may not explode, fly into the air or dart uncontrollably on the ground.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They must perform under a ten feet, ten foot height restriction, and six foot circumference are limited to under 500 grams of composition and are subject to strict packaging and transportation guidelines. State law allows them to be sold used to possess from June 28th, noon to July the sixth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's important to understand the difference between safe and sane versus illegal or dangerous fireworks. Again, as defined in the California Health and Safety Code, once approved authority transfers to local jurisdictions to allow their sale and use within their borders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is an opt in system. It's up to the city to craft the ordinance, set criteria for and issue the permits, set fees and administer the program. Currently, there are three 270 communities that allow the sale of state approved fireworks in California, 63 of them in Southern California, throughout Ventura, L.A., Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial Counties'",
        "'speaker_2': '. 39 sell here in L.A. County. TNT is a wholesale distributor to 2500 nonprofit organizations statewide who sell these products as a fundraiser for the 4th of July. Most of the nonprofits are youth organizations, high school athletics, Pop Warner, Little League, church groups of all denominations, and finally service philanthropic and veteran organizations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many rely on firework sales as a majority of the revenue for their programs. The past five years, there's been significant activity among cities bringing back fireworks in the state of California. Most recently, voters in Fullerton approved the overturn of a ban from fireworks from 1990.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Westminster voters did the same in 2010. Villa Park, Brawley. Calexico, Stockton. Tracy, Lodi, Salinas, West Sacramento and Dixon all opened in the past five years. We know there are challenges in education, administration and public safety when it comes to a fireworks discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are existing ordinances in Southern California that can and do address those concerns. Want to comment? A couple of comments made. We're not talking about toys here. State law prohibits the sale to anyone under 16 years of age.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Most cities have adopted 18 year old wire. Of course, sparklers have been banned in California since 1993. Injury statistics quoted earlier include all fireworks, which includes full CE, which are not available in California. Voters did not approve fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And on Extra Beach, that was a council action by a vote of 5 to 2. There was a change in the council majority during the second year of that, and that council voted 4 to 3 not to continue fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Any other comments?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Celebration of a great American revolution should be encouraged. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Eddie Rozell. As I look at 3509 Lewis Avenue in the seventh District, I want to thank Mr. Austin for bringing this thing up. I've been in the city of Long Beach for 39 years, and those 39 years I've been criminalized every July 4th because I'm one of those people that buy fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would say to everybody, please consider this. The gentleman just spoke right now, if his numbers are true, people want this. And why should I be spending money in Lakewood or in Bellflower when I could be spending it here in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, I respect everything that our esteemed police chief and fire chief have said about this, but it is like the gentleman just said, it is a traditional thing. And again, before you dismissal of this thing, I think what Mr. Austin has brought up is very valid, a very good issue that should be brought up, like I said'",
        "'speaker_2': ', 39 years and Long Beach and 39 years criminalized. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very good. Good. You? The clerk has the address. With all due respect, the book. I think that this motion is a prima facie case. Against the second hand smoke of marijuana is obviously. Unchecked in the gentleman's district. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, Mr. Johnson?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it's hard to top that, Mayor, but I guess I want some clarification. But I think we've had some pretty good conversation. And my point of view is, I think, you know, I appreciate the councilor also bring this up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it is worthy of kind of robust conversation. Hearing the pros and cons, I'm not really eager to put on the April ballot. I think we just heard about it tonight, but I am interested in talking about it more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So is is the consensus that we're saying that we're going to hear more from staff, get some reports, think about it, and then consider whether it put on the June ballot or actually sign up tonight. Put on the June ballot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I, I wanted to say on the motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Remote motion is still to put it on an April ballot. Oh, but he may change it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll ask both. Councilor, also, what do you think about perhaps take some time, maybe ask his staff to come back with the full report canvasing power station. Then we can come back at a future meeting with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe meets their needs or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We can have a report within 30 days. I think, you know, I would definitely be open to a friendly amendment to moving it to the June ballot ballot with four, but with having a lot more information from from staff in terms of what what the the cost will be, what type of potential revenues we could be looking'",
        "'speaker_9': 'at getting here. Is it worth it necessarily to pursue this from a from a fiscal standpoint? And we also have to address the the the cost of public safety. And and moving forward with this, we would have to definitely have to, I think, compensate for that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm open to an amendment to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To make sure that that'll be my friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's be clear what exactly the amendment is. The amendment, as I understand it, from what I heard, is to to ask for a report from staff on the items that were enumerated within 30 days, and that at that point, we would consider whether or not it would be put on the June ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not making the June decision tonight, but waiting for the information, which seems appropriate. Okay, that's the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Mayor. Okay, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Members, cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, the city clerk has, quote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The deadline for the June election would be March.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seven. Okay. So we'll be having before March 7th. 30 days would be early February.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'It's voters of the City of Long Beach, an ordinance amending Chapter 3.80 of the municipal code relating to marijuana, business license, general tax parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they are members of the City Council. Before you tonight, you have a recommendation as requested by the Council with two options for submission to the voters in April. The first option would place a tax on the sale of marijuana at 6%, and option B would be a variable tax, which would be a maximum tax of 10%'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But the Council would have the discretion to set that initial rate at 6% and thereafter vary the tax not to exceed 10%. There's also a square footage tax for the cultivation sites, and we would stand ready to answer any questions that you have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. STEELE.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. PARK. In regard to the second alternative that you mentioned and regarding the taxing, so explain that a little bit more. So we would set the tax initially at 6%. And then based on revenues and things of that nature, we would have the ability to adjust that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Under this proposal or under version B, the the approval of the voters under Prop 218 would authorize the council to establish or set the rate as high as a 10%, the initial rate as requested by the Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We came back with the initiated 6% and then subsequent to that, the council could move up or down at the desire of the council, but it could never exceed 10% without going back to the voters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And are there automatic triggers in that moving up or down or that the council just deliberates? And what was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That similar to the version? A There is. Is an automatic adjustment for CPI. But other than that, there is no automatic. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to ask Mr. Parkin the proposed square footage fee. Is is that something that you observed in other cities? Councilmember Lowenthal State law prohibits cities from charging certain types of nonprofit organizations a business tax or fee based on gross receipts or income.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And although some some businesses, all businesses are currently required by the CAA and the MPAA to be not for profit, these businesses are not necessarily non-profits as designed as defined by the state constitution, the municipal code in the IRS.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Therefore, a tax rate per square foot for those religious and charitable, charitable nonprofits has been developed. So it was a way to actually. It's a way to make to create a tax that would apply to all businesses operating in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's consistent with the taxing structure that the business license division uses currently for other other kinds of religious and charitable nonprofits. So you're not proposing an either or. You're proposing, in addition to the 6%, the $30 or under version A or $50 under version B.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be one or the other, not both.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry, not version A and B together, but if it's 6%, it's $30 per square foot. If down the road it was raised to 10%, it's $50 per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under version eight, it would be the $30 per square foot adjusted annual CPI. Under Version B, it would start at the $50 per square foot increase for CPI.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in terms of the actual dollar amount for the square footage, I know and I appreciate you sharing that with me. I understand where the need comes from or the requirement anyway. So I'd be interested in a lower amount, I think.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, in speaking with members in the in the community that are looking to operate and give back by way of tax receipts or by way of tax revenue, I get the sense that $30 is is a lot, especially per square foot, for an operation where 100% of what's cultivated in that square footage doesn't necessarily produce something'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that they can sell. So I'm I don't see the calculation here on how you came up with $30. I'm not necessarily looking to question that. I'm suggesting that it appears to be high from what I'm hearing from the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The information we were given by the business license division is that that's consistent with what they do for other kinds of for other kinds of businesses. There aren't a lot of others to compare. However, the example that they used was manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If, for example, you have it's two different kinds of operations, one is retail and one is cultivation or storage. So is this. So the the fee itself, the determination of the fee itself is something that was proposed by the business license division.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And is this per year the square footage fee? It's per square foot. How often? Every day. Every month. Every year? Well, annually. Annually. Okay. I appreciate that. Okay. I will wait to hear from my colleagues. I need to rethink this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jimmy. Miss Parker, just. Mr. Parker, just so I understand, is there's a $30 per square foot fee annually. That correct? Yes. In the cultivation area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So 4000 square feet would be. No, 4000 square feet. $30 would be 30,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Should be less.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know that that. That strikes me as a little steep, Mr. Moon. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If. And just to reiterate, I want to be sure I heard correctly. It's not either or. It's both. Correct. It's the under version.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Either case.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really? I'm sorry. It's either 6% or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's no parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Amy said both. No, it's either or. It's. If you're a cultivation site, there's a square footage, there's a fair square footage fee tax. If you are a retail operation, there's a gross receipts tax. So but but an entity can operate as both.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the intent is not to is not to tax. If there isn't if there is a business that operates both a cultivation site and a retail operation, the intent is not to tax twice. Okay. Which would you tax the retail side or the cultivation side?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think consistent with what business license does with other operations that are similar, they would tax the retail site. Okay. If I operated both if I had both you you would tax the retail site. So if I if I were one of the operators, I had a retail site and I also cultivated on site or off site'",
        "'speaker_5': ', what would my tax be? Would it be the 6% or would it be the $30 per square foot? I think that your tax would be the gross receipts tax, the 6%, although that's something we can clarify with financial management.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. That's it for me right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank. You know, I think there's some confusion here. Can you walk us through the differences between these two ordinances? Once again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Version version A is an ordinance that fixes the tax rate at 6%, so that there's so that there's a clear expectation of what the gross the gross receipts, taxes version B proposes to set a maximum of 10% with an initial rate of 6%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The purpose of that is to give Council some flexibility, as was requested, so that if it if it appears that there are additional additional factors that need to be taken into consideration, the tax rate could be raised by ordinance of the Council up to a maximum of 10%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Prop 218 requires a vote of the people that establishes the tax. So in order to in order to be able to do that and get it on the upcoming ballot, the maximum tax was set at 10% grade.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then on the the per square foot charges, they 30 and 50. 30 or 50. I'm surgeon age 30. Yeah. Correct. We're talking about the square footage v 34, version 1854, version B.'",
        "'speaker_5': '30, 30, 30 is four. It reflects the 6%. So it's supposed to be parallel to the 6% gross annual receipts seats tax. Okay. 10% would be the maximum under the under version BS, maximum 10%. So if we started out with an initial rate of 6%, even under version B, we would want to make the per square footage'",
        "'speaker_5': 'tax consistent with the rate on with with the 6% gross annual receipts rate. So that would be a maximum rate. Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. DeLong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So if you had two locations, so you had one that was the retail operation. And three blocks away you had a couple cultivation sites, or would you pay a gross sales at the retail location and then you would pay a square foot at the gross facility that was several blocks away?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's right. I think if you had a if you had a cultivation site and maybe I didn't understand the question when it was asked previously, if you have a cultivation site and the cultivation and that is your operation, then you'd pay the square footage fee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you have, in addition to the cultivation site, a retail site that's separate that that's retail and a cultivation site. You're performing two different operations. That's the parallel to the manufacturing example that I talked about earlier. That business license occasionally has to deal with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's the parallel there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you would pay both.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You would pay both. So now let's say that year you move your operation, you find a larger facility, you've got the kind of the storefront in the front, right, and then in the back you're going to have the grow facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would you not pay both? If you're if you're co-located on one site where you would pay the the percentage of your gross sales and then you'd pay a square foot for their growth facility.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I think in that example, you would pay both because you're still performing both operations, you're still cultivating and selling, but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hopefully.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You'd only pay the square footage on the growth facility area and the retail store. You would not have to pay the $50 square foot because you're paying a gross sales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I thought that's what you meant. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I swear to you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. Just one clarification and then a question. And just to be clear, so, for example, let's say we went with a version B that square, because just because you're listing the square foot in version B is 50, that could be 30 as an example as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. Okay. Correct. Then secondly, back to the $30 a square foot cost. You say that's being compared to other businesses. What other businesses are are we comparing to?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because that's actually.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That seems.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That there's actually a fairly small range of cities that have taxes in place. The lowest seems to be 2.5%. And the highest is in in the range of ten, 10 to 15%. City of Los Angeles, for example, is 6%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was how the 6% figure was originally arrived at. And the $30, the $30 square foot fee was used in a previous ordinance. It was the recreational marijuana ordinance that was passed by a vote of the people in 2010 as Proposition B.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's on the books in the Long Beach Municipal Code, but it was never activated because state law never state law was not passed that allowed that to become a law. So that but that that parallel between the 6% and that and the square footage fee is in that ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's that's really the model that we had to look at that and the model of other cities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Longo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. Well, this is certainly a dynamic policy area. And so version B, my understanding of it is it basically gives the council the most flexibility, right? So so it sets a maximum tax rate, but we could have it anything up to or anything less than in any given Tuesday, we could basically vote to lower the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tax that we felt was appropriate. Is that correct? That's correct. And version A, we're adopt that. And we decided that there were some unforeseen challenges or law enforcement needs or what have you. And we decided we wanted to increase attacks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would not be able to do that without going back to the people at a regularly scheduled election, which might be a year or two in the future. Is that accurate? That is accurate. Right. Well, my thought is, I think we do need to have the most flexibility and certainly I'm not sure what the right tax rate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is tonight. 6% seems to be like a good starting point, but I wouldn't want to bind future councils.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tonight it was very shifty here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Mayor, I see that there must be some way to combine this with fireworks. Figure that out. Yeah. I wanted to ask the city attorney a couple of things. Who. Who are we taxing in this scenario? Since nobody legally can operate Long Beach right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that that the ordinance would not become affected unless and until there is an ordinance adopted by the city council pursuant to the process that you discussed at your last council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And is there language to that effect any place?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, there is. In both versions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What you've got attached here is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An on page on page eight, which is in version B, the it's section K titled Operative Date. And I think the version A. Sometimes we do it also in Virgina. It's also on page eight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Obviously, it has to be very clear in any ballot measure that there are no existing businesses that are in existence currently. Okay. And we don't apply a gross receipts tax. I think I remember we had this discussion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Johnson had brought this up as well. Los Angeles, I think, does and has caused considerable problems with their businesses because it's considered a a terrible burden. So do we. We don't do gross receipts tax on any other business.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know we there is in the ordinance that I mentioned earlier, Proposition B, that was the recreational marijuana tax.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I'm talking about current businesses in Long Beach. No other type of business currently is taxed on gross receipts tax.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not that I'm aware of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Then I am going to ask the question at some point, could this tax be challenged discriminatory? Because no other class of business in Long Beach, when you apply for a business, you pay a business license and it's based upon the number of employees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't do gross receipts tax on anyone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, there are a number of other cities that have done it on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know this. I understand. But we also got Sudan. What some other cities did, too, as well. So I'm just you know, we're setting out proposing a tax rate that we don't apply to any other business. And obviously, this wouldn't keep us from applying gross receipts tax on any business in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. But that's why I don't want us to go there. Okay. Because I am concerned this opens the door for other businesses to be taxed in this scenario. My other thing, it's not very clearly stated in any place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The county tax rate is 9.5%. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The sales tax rate?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Sales tax rate that they would have to pay. I've done a lot of reading with the Board of Equalization and they've indicated that they would have to pay, that they do have to pay a whatever the prevailing tax rate is for your county, which is 9.5%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you're adding a 6% to 10%, which would mean they're going to be taxed 15.5 to 29.5%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. That would be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. All right. Okay. We'll keep going, because in the ordinance, it also says the administrative fee to be added. Do we have any concept what the administrative fee would be for each of these?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The administrators is going to be developed along with the ordinance, the regulatory ordinance. And I think that that at that point, there would be a better idea of what those costs would be. But the intent, I believe, from the council last week was to include enforcement costs in addition to other kinds of costs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we don't have any idea what it is, but it could be quite substantial, especially if this council moves in a direction to limit the number of these facilities. That's because it does say that we'd be able to recoup enforcement costs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. And that this is more rhetorical than anything. But there's no other medicine in California that's taxed. There's no other medicine in California. This tax just simply isn't enough. This is medical marijuana. I've contended all along that we need to treat it like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the things that I think needs to be clarified for voters, too, is that because this is very similar to oil revenue, it's unpredictable because we don't know how much the sales will be and how much will get than this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The revenue could not go into the general fund necessarily would have to be used as one time revenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or you can have a baseline, you know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, that has, I would think, needs to be spelled out, Mr. Mayor, because if you're going to ask the voters to approve something, we certainly don't want to be disingenuous and make them think it's going to go to for police, fire recreation, when in fact, if we then look at it as one time revenue, it can't be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'used for ongoing police and fire and recreation costs because we can't do certain portions of our oil revenue for that reason. And I understand Mr. GROSS isn't here, but I don't know Mr. West if if he's weighed in on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But part of the argument is going to be, obviously, to the voters, how are you going to use this revenue? So I don't know that we can really promise it can go for police services, fire services, recreation services, because that has not been the Council policy on unpredictable income for revenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's rhetorical, but I do want to address that. I think that that's not quite correct. We pig oil at $70, everything below $70.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, no. Let's be fair. Is for ongoing. So you could do the same thing here. You're going to have some. It may be material. It may not. You'll find out after some experience. You could always set some level of revenue that would you almost assured you're going to receive and that would be used for ongoing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I understand your point, but it's not all or nothing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I didn't say it was all or nothing, but I do think that the voters deserve clarification as to how they run to the ballot to go vote this on people, by the way, who from every testimony we've been given can the least that can afford this because they have medical problems, then I don't want us to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be promising this is going to pay for fire and police and whatever. Once you say that, then this becomes a specified tax and not a general tax. So and that requires a different threshold. So yeah, two thirds. So I'm that that's why I ask if we get some clarification, where's this money going to go or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that the taxpayers can know that and especially the people going to be taxed there last night and I don't know, the city attorney can opine on this, but one of the arguments I've heard repeatedly from against the taxation of medical marijuana is that what it can do is, especially if we are limiting the number of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'outlets for this, it can force the people who need this medication to go seek illegal sources because they don't have to pay the taxes and all the extra money isn't added on their stuff. So I just say that I understand that, you know, I mean, I don't understand why the rush is to put this tax right now'",
        "'speaker_6': ', since we haven't grappled with how to get people back into business. But that would be a concern, too, that, you know, we're penalizing a group of people that we are saying publicly we're concerned about. But at the same hand, my understanding that this what's the enforcement mechanism about taxing an entity, it's up to us to go do'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the audits. But if people are out there selling other in other venues, they don't have to pay a tax on it, correct? No, they don't. If they're not allowed to illegally operate in Long Beach, how is it that we are we have access to their books to tax them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this has happened in other occasions. I just asked this has been an issue about taxing medical marijuana. We're not talking about recreational marijuana. We're not talking about full legalization. We're talking about specifying going after a group of people whose use is dependent is going to be dependent on these facilities that, you know, if we're adding all'",
        "'speaker_6': 'these extra costs and tax onto it, the incentive for someone to get it and another source is much higher.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Than we tax aspirin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's an over-the-counter prescription. Medicine is not taxed in California. An aspirin is not a prescribed medication. You can get it over the counter truck got hold of equalization tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exempt from sales?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Yes, exempt from sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. SANDERS.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. You know, I was listening, you know, as some individuals have come to me and it seemed like to me that some of the dispensary, you know, lobbyists talk to me about what they said they wanted to be taxed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what I'm listening to, it seems like they're really trying to as they try to tax them out of even going into business. So I think it would be nice to kind of hear from them and see where they're standing because I don't know, this is new to all of us, you know, trying to get some dispensaries'",
        "'speaker_2': 'here. But I think we should be fair to, you know, each parties once we find out what we're which way we're going, especially if we're going to put this on the ballot, they want to be taxed. And I think they should be because fact that they're going to make money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think the city should make something from it also. But I don't think they should be, you know, out so much from that because the fact that, you know, this is this is new to us. And I think we have to really find a way to do it and do it right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's all I'm saying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'AUSTIN So isn't there a tax on aspirin? I think I was actually queued up here. I favor the the the approach, and I do appreciate the comments of all my colleagues. Councilman Reshevsky Lipski, you bring up some very good points, but I favor an approach that gives the city the the the best amount of flexibility should this'",
        "'speaker_9': 'go to a ballot initiative. I'm really interested still to hear from the public on this as well. But, you know, I think version B provides that for us and we can get into, you know, what it's going to look like later on and how much it'll be and how much the the the, the, the other fees will'",
        "'speaker_9': 'be. I don't know that that that's going to going to going to going to resolve the issue that's really before us. I mean, we, we sent staff back to give us options. They've given us the option. We have version here before us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have version B before us. In my opinion, version B gives the city the best flexibility and the opportunity for future councils to to deal with this issue. I think effectively should we come back and I once we have an ordinance in place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To sort out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I just want to echo what Councilmember Austin says. My preference would be that the city have maximum flexibility. And let's remember why we're doing this. We're doing it. We're doing this to recoup some of the costs associated with this venture.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's going to be cost on police activity for sure. The police are going to have to monitor some of these, just like a bar, just like when a bar opens. We have a copy. There's fees associated with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is essentially the same venture and alcohol is taxed, right? So but probably probably at a higher level when you would add up all the fees, I would imagine, Jerry I don't know. But that's not so important as we're we're trying to recoup some costs here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're trying to be reasonable. We're trying to give the community what we believe they want, and we're trying to think it through. But let's not just chase our tail here and say we can never do anything. Back to you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Austin, I believe you wanted to make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, I'm sorry. I'll move to to approve version B because the city council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll second that and I'd like to hear from the public to take.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember long don't I just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would like to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a motion and a second. We'll take public comment. Please identify yourself when the light comes on. You've got 30 seconds left.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Larry. Good. You clerk has the address. Having listened to the dialog over the last 10 minutes or 20 minutes on this one thing, it's clear. Everybody said this is a new frontier. So I'm going to make a suggestion following the suggestions and the council in the way it dealt with the last item as it read now reads'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A ballot is to be placed on it, to be placed ready for the ballot in 2004, April eight, 2014. I'm going to make a suggestion that what you do is amend this to allow you to follow and learn from a very highly successful paradigm that was used to address major problems years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If Mike Latin is correct, formerly known as the conciliation trade, intended to try strike that continuum a.k.a the Council of Trent and I would suggest you set the date for April 8th, 2044, that will give you ample time to sort through all of the issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And some of the points I think you should consider is number. And I don't think enough time has been allowed for this. There's a reason. There's a reason marijuana is often referred to as dope. We've got a lot of dope, had a lot of dopes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. It'll give you time to reflect on the very sage advice from your chief of police relative to how ill advised the path is that you're now taking. Some of those already doped up would point to Colorado. And watch state of Washington.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you've got to understand, those are entirely different paradigms. Long Beach is a city cheek to jowl in terms of neighborhoods surrounded by some of the worst criminal and gang activity on the face. Of this country. Period. Consider also that marijuana is generally recognized as a gateway drug.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The next thing that will be you'll be dealing with will be cocaine. Meth labs like are now inundating the high desert area. I think there could be a case made for medical marijuana under strict conditions. You know, I've always said if we're going to sell it, will sell it from the top floor of the parking garage or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the police department's parking garage. But make no mistake about it, 99% of the activity will come from marijuana for recreational use, which will be out of control. So I would suggest you adopt it. Change it. Come back with a date of April eight, 2044.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. Council Vice Mayor and Staff Jina Nam. I represent the Long Beach Collective Association. As Councilmember Andrews succinctly put it, we have yes, as a as a organization, supported taxation, but we are concerned about the level of taxation that may be voted on through this, these two versions, particularly with respect to the square footage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What we anticipated or we hoped was that the city would focus on a growth sales tax. We were supportive of that of something, whether 6% or 8% or higher, 10%. We always stated that that we can live with pretty much because the the state already taxes the sales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It considers these transactions as sales even though it does involve non-profits and it does involve a prescribed medication. But nonetheless, the body does go by gross sales and there's a way of tracking that and taxing that. So we were okay with the city implementing something that parallels that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, certain things that come to mind, for example, in terms of of how gross receipts are defined within this measure. We have collectives and we have members of the collectives. They can come in and they present. Really what it is, is a donation for the medication.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a suggested donation, but if they don't have the money for it, they're given the medication for free. Alternatively, some will come in and they'll want to barter, barter their their services. They may want to come in and help clean up the collective or help cultivate or do some other services at the at the particular location.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, the definitions of this version, either version, that would be then within gross receipts. So then how do we how do how do we track that and then pay a tax on that when that wouldn't be considered as a sale under the Bowie rules?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But then now under the Long Beach rules, it would be a gross receipt and therefore taxed. So there's that. Then also with respect to the square footage. Again, we have definitions of square footage that includes areas of the dispensary that may not be used for anything, including garages, carports, porches, similar structures, parking structures.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So then if we have if we're providing parking to get the people, the patients offered the streets and now they're parking at the location, are we going to be paying square footage tax on that as well? According to this definition, it does look like that it will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there are these number of concerns within this, these the way that the definitions have been drafted that really give us pause. And the next speakers will address the actual fiscal impact.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening, counsel. How you doing? Hope you had a good holiday. I didn't prepare anything. Really.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Make sure. Just identify yourself real quick.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Adam Hijazi. I'm a registered voter in the city of Long Beach and part of LBC. So I didn't get a chance to really specifically, you know, get into what the impacts would be with that, but just off the face.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So you have Virgin and Virgin B, which is going to be 6% plus $30 a square foot on the cultivation sites, plus $6 a square foot on the collective side on the retail. So the retail would be getting taxed at a 6% rate and would also be getting taxed at the square footage from a collective perspective from'",
        "'speaker_11': 'what what the ballot was saying. Now, Virgin B, which gives the flexibility, as you're saying, council member Austin from 6 to 10%, then it's at $50 a square foot for the co-op. I'm sorry up to. A m I didn't get a chance to really read it and see it 100%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But from what I saw, he did say $50 per square foot. If it is up to then.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So under version B, as I understand it, if it starts at $6 that it would be $30 a square foot as it is in version eight. But if we moved it up to $10 or 10%, it would be up to $50 a square foot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not correct. The way the version V currently states is that it is $50, as the Speaker said, and up to 10%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But Mr. parking it could if the council wanted to modify that too with a range like like the the percentage of the gross receipts it could be as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There could be an amendment by then.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, let's continue with public comment and then we'll come back to the please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct. So sorry, you've got version B, it's got 6 to 10%. That's where the flexibility is going to come in, 6 to 10%, which is fine. We understand there needs to be flexibility now on the square footage, $50 per square foot and then on top on the retail is going to be $10 per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, you know, you have an average collective to say just from the experience is going to be from 3000 to 10000 square feet. And that's kind of what happened during the process that was put into place. So, you know, taking an average of 5000 square feet, if you go with plan B with $50 a square foot, you're'",
        "'speaker_11': 'talking about $150,000 a. I'm sorry. $250,000. Now, that is just a 50,000. That's just a $50 square foot plus, whatever, $10, you know, it is going to be for, you know, the collective side. And also, that's not including the 9.25 or 9.5% of the bill we tax.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Also not including whatever payroll taxes that will come into place, you know. So you've got to be really, you know, critical with, you know, how this gains the tax. Now, the 6% to 10%, there's a range. It's completely, you know, understood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I mean, 6% was L.A. did a lot of research into it, and they came up with 6%. And I believe between the city attorney's office and whoever they were working with that came to that that could work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, you know, the square footage, you know, I mean, we would hope that, you know, I think something that possible you can realistically where the city will optimal get the amount of optimal tax without taxing businesses. I mean without overtaxing businesses and pretty much pulling out of business would be anywhere from maybe 10 to $15 a square'",
        "'speaker_11': 'foot on the cultivation side, plus all those other taxes. I mean, so we really haven't had the chance to go through it all, but it would be pretty much heavily taxed. And, you know, it can eventually be an increase in the mayor's and, you know, California state law.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You want affordable, quality and affordable meds. And I just kind of think that would be highly taxed with a $50 per square foot, even 30. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. I'm probably probably just as turd as me as I am of you tonight. Disability rights. I do want to thank you, Jerry. Jerry Gypsy has pretty much expressed as much as pretty much everything I would like to say.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think she's absolutely correct. My God, people want to suck these patients dry. I mean, I have. Maybe you don't have the experience. I do. I have people calling me, begging me, help me. My mother has cancer. I have somebody who's sick.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've got someone who's got M.S. I've got I get these phone calls. And these are people who are in my. Sorry, I'm. Excuse me. I get I mean it. I cry when I hear these people. I mean, they're in tears begging me, help, help me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, where do I go? Where do I get some some sort of medicine to help, you know, help my mother or my my child? My child that's got seizures that I mean, it just breaks my heart when I hear you guys talk.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're mercenary, for God's sakes. It's like you want to suck these patients dry. And, you know, I mean, you can charge these guys all you want, but my you know, they've got it here. There there are patients that come in that can't afford it, so they give it to them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You want to charge them for that, too? I mean, I want you to really think about what you're doing. Are you helping the people that are really sick, the ones that are needing it, the ones that have disabilities in there?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Out there, you know, someone just said it's 99%. No, that's not true. There are some people who do abuse the system and who do recreational use. I'm not going to say that's not true. But there are people, legitimate people that are sick out there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Please don't bleed them dry. Please don't bleed. These people are here to try to to to put forward a legitimate situation that they can give these patients access. Please help them. Okay? Please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'John Bianco, member of LBC, a members of the council and vice mayor. I've heard a lot of good things up here tonight from certain speakers on other subjects just other than ours. But we're trying to create something here, fellows and ladies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if you if we get taxed to the max with everything somebody has to absorb, like she was saying, he's going to have to absorb that cost. Next thing you know, people that really need the thing, need the help for it, they're there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's just, how can I say this without getting everybody mad at me? It's ridiculous. You know, I understand the fees to this, to that, to this, to that. But this $30, $50 a square foot. I mean, you can ask any, let's say farmer, he's not going to get 100% back to every tomato plant plant either.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are we in the cultivation business with the marijuana? So, I mean, it's like, I don't know, I wish you people, guys, ladies would reconsider what you're doing here tonight. As far as this taxation thing goes, we really assumption as a group that if we got things in place, we would be able to do things for the city'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with the city donating, being involved, helping out charities, helping out whatever needed help with it. Looks like that's getting taken out of our hands. That's fine and dandy. Please don't make it. We're. We're in a position to where it's like it's cheaper for these people to go buy in an alley than come to a safe access place'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because of all the exorbitant fees we got to absorb to be able to to to give them their medical their medical cannabis. And like I said, nobody's going to to say 30 and 50. So I don't know. Like I said, you're never going to get 100% back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So where do these how does this how do you figure this out? How are you going to apply all this? You know, that's that's my major. My concern is I'd rather give it away, make it as cheap as possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I don't want to be forced to look people in the eye and say, hey, I got to do this because I got to pay that. And they're going to look at me and say, Why are you paying it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they have to tell because that's what everybody wants us to do. Alls we want to do is be a service for these people, and you're going to make it really tough if you keep adding on all these fees, this that this year, all we want to do, get this thing open, get it rolling, provide a service'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to the people that we want that we want to do it with. Thank you. Have a good evening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and take it behind back to them. We're going to go back to the maker of the motion who has some additional comments and thoughts. Councilor Brosnan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, and I do appreciate the public comment. Appreciate the comments coming from my colleagues on this and the staff work on this. I mean, I appreciate understanding what other cities are doing in terms of putting taxes on on these businesses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, Oakland, San Jose, Berkeley, we have the figures in front of us. I'd like to if my who's Councilmember Lowenthal is amenable to reconsidering the motion on version B, the cultivation growth facility piece instead of $50 per square foot, can we say up to $50 per square foot to give the Council the flexibility and discretion to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'work within that range? If that's something that is? First of all, I would ask the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city attorney first.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. The the motion would be then to not to exceed 50 similar to the 6 to 10%. You're going to do a maximum of $50 per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in doing so, at what point does the council determine what that is?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, the way I understand the amendment to the motion you were, you're just setting the what the maximum established fee could be. And the council needs to decide whether you would want to be at least starting it. Initially, your tax rate is 6% if it's not amended.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so so at this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're free to Austin in addition to that. So setting the upper limit at $50 for the maximum of 10% when we look at version A for the 6%, can we start that at 15 instead of the 30?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm okay with that. I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So up to 30. But we can start that at six at $15.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it's up to 50 now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there are two different versions. So under the 6% rate version.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The motion was under version B.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So under version B, currently it's going to be $50 and starting at 6%. So I believe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Up to $50.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Think got comfortable I can't remember what I was saying is that under version B could have been 15 to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Start.'",
        "'speaker_10': '50.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So there's a range. So you're looking at 6 to 10, 15 to 50. That's I think the rate that correct. Okay. Is when.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't come back and have that $30 as a starting point, that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Works for me.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So as a maker, the motion and then the flat and then the the second accounting move, although I think we're in agreement there. Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, you know, you know, listen to this. You know, like I said, this is new for the city of Long Beach, but I think we got to get it right. You guys in really certainly listen to these, the percentage of what they're trying to do, you know, after it just seems like it's just out of proportion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that we're going in and what we're doing here, I think, is what we're going to make even the dispensary's you could even cause them to go crooked, look like they're working for us. But the percentage you will put it on them, I just think, are we going to do it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We got to do it right. Because you say we have sick people. We're talking about a dispensary. We're talking about individuals who need you guys. I just don't know. I'm just saying what I feel and I just think it would be the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do it. We got to do it right. We don't need to sit around and keep it. We put too much on this and then what's going to happen. They need to get their money, too, and it's going to cause a whole you talk about crime, it's going to you know, like I say, it will take care'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of itself because they're going to make their money just like they said, we want to tax them. Well, let's be fair in all of this, because what I'm listening to just doesn't seem fair. So if we're going to do it, let's do it right, you guys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's get it right the first time. That's the difference between.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These two income.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do you have any suggestions?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, you may have. Sorry. May I follow up with Councilmember Andrews?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure, I have. I have one speaker right before you and then I'll go to. Would you mind?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But just for him to elaborate in terms of getting it right, I wanted to know what the alternative is, because I think lowering it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More akin to what the speaker's requested. Having zero does not seem like an option that the city attorney has provided us, because it would not, according to them, not be legal to tax a profit. And so that's where the per square footage fee comes from.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So did you have a suggestion for what it could be?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think what they're saying, you know, like I say, you know, we started six, which seemed like a go to ten and all of a sudden we're talking about 250 some thousand. If in this situation it goes to that because we can be flexible with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If they make more, we get more. But first, let's see where they start making it. I mean, sounds like you guys said that they're going to start making all this money. We're going to get this tax. I don't know where it's going to start, but I think we should be really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you guys, we've been going with this one. I'm in two years. I think, you know, you five and it's going to happen whether we like it or not. But I think at least we should give them a chance to do what we know is right and get these sick people some help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Okay. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, wait.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So we have we do, however, have some other speakers. We do have a motion on the floor. Just as a reminder, we're doing the motion on the floor is a version B, that's from 6 to 10%, from 15 to 50.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I go over to council worship scheme.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By senior members of the council clarify clarifying the motion. Is there a starting square footage as it started? Is the initial will be 15 or the initial was 30? I didn't hear the initial 15.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we're speaking. My question is on Prop 218 requirements about specificity. When you do a a rolling amount that you know do. I know. I know. But it has to be very clearly stated that it gives the counsel the discretion and that there has to be some criteria.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Otherwise, it's just, you know, you're putting a figure out there that asking them to vote on that. It's not very specified as to when that can be used. In other words, if you're going up to $50 a square foot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Under what conditions does that have? I mean, when does that happen? What what triggers? You can go up to 50.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Currently the it would be up to the discretion of the Council to verify and determine that an increase would be warranted and that at that time you would have whatever evidence or documentation you want to justify the increase.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What we're asking for under Prop 218 is the authority to tax at that upper upper level. And so the assurances to the people that are voting for this is that that tax or that rate would never exceed that unless a vote it goes back to a vote of the people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that will be specified in whatever ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. It would be a maximum amount, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Lowenthal and then Councilman Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think you I wanted to just clarify that having heard council member Andrew's remarks, I appreciate that and agree with that. And I think we're accomplishing that with the range that we've come up with. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for raising that. And that's it for me.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Got to Bird Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I guess I need some clarification on the motion. So what the city attorney had before us was not a range of caps. In other words, no higher than 10%. It could be 9%, could be 1% if we want to later on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this conversation arranged itself is actually putting a floor saying that tax would be no lower than 6%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that is that your intent or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You're asking the maker of the motion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I mean, what they really proposed was that no higher than 10%, but we would have full discretion to lower it to whatever we wanted below 10%.'",
        "'speaker_10': '6 to 10.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So I guess the city attorney. So would you had originally proposed it would never go below 6%. The council would not have that discretion. We initially proposed an initial rate at 6% to a maximum of 10%. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The question under Prop 218, if it was asked, is, could you lower attacks? And I think the answer to that is yes. You can always lower a tax without going back to a vote of the people if it was the will of the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So the motion is basically version B, except the cultivation grow facility square footage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fee would be $15. Is that accurate? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It started 15.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It could be no higher than 55.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Neal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Mr. Vice Mayor, Mr. City Clerk, can you clarify what has to happen tonight to make sure that this even qualifies for the ballot? I can I can do that. Vice mayor and members of the council, essentially tonight, what you need to do is you need to adopt a resolution calling for the election on April 8th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that, you need to adopt the text of the measure that will be presented to the voters. And with that, we would then have a call for argument writers that would be date, that would be made right after you take item 16.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those are basically the three parts that need to be taken care of. So if we can't come to an agreement tonight, then there's no chance of having this on the April ballot, correct? Unless you had a special meeting between now and Friday to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Got to remember the long.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Call for the question.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good questions being called. There's no objection. We have a motion on the floor which has been just been repeated recently with public comment. Members, go ahead and please cast your votes. 15.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. I know the question was called, but the issue of the $10 per square foot. Mr. City Attorney on the collective side, what is that for? Is that in addition to the cultivation grove? So if is that on the retail side?'",
