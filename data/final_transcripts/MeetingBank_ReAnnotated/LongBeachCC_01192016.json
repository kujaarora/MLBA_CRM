Next, a pre statement of qualifications meeting was held in early September with potential proposers.'",

All proposers were deemed qualified and were notified by purchasing of the opportunity to present to an evaluation committee consisting of airport and purchasing staff on October 12th.'",

Therefore, in late October, Jacobs Engineering was requested to submit a scope of services as well as a cost proposal, both of which were received several weeks later.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'After reaching a successful agreement on scope and fees with the airport purchasing, posted the notice of intent to award to Jacobs Engineering Group on December 14th.

All of you are on record stating that you are in support of the noise ordinance and don't want to put'",

        "'speaker_5': 'American Airlines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To even see if the noise ordinance is at risk. If we move forward with an office, why spend that 385,000? You know, as recently stated that the state of the city is strong.

        "'speaker_13': 'The accurate number is $349,845 to provide you with additional information to make an intelligent decision on whether or not to approve the request for international flying. The only reason that this is back before you is because the cost has gone beyond the city manager's limits of $250,000.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Hello, Robert. How you doing? City Council. My name is Steve Uptake. I'm a retired bisexual man living here in Long Beach. I've worked all my life. I do not have a criminal record. And I have requested over and over again that the city and the airport put in a noise monitor in the south by southwest part'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the airport, which there is not a noise monitor. And you have a law or something about that. And you should put one there, because not only are you flying more of those little airplanes over my house and dropping fuel and oil on top of us that live there and the kids that live there, you're also flying'",
        "'speaker_5': 'big jets over my house that just started. I don't know. You didn't tell me about that one either. Now, let me change the subject. Okay. I'm actually going along with you here, guys. But you got to think big.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know what Hong Kong did? They got up off the coast over here like you did when you built the port. They built up an airport where you can have the biggest international airport you want. And that way it could be done where people aren't going to complain about it, like me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About airplanes falling out of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The sky on top of their heads or drop in oil or whatever the heck comes out of them. And then you could build yourself a big airport like Hong Kong. And I think some other country has built an airport off their coast also and have an international airport because there is a future if we don't blow ourselves'",
        "'speaker_5': 'up. And that way you could have your international airport. You know, you should think about things like that. And then you could have all that real estate over there to make another gazillion dollars on. I'm not against making money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's about, you know, how you treat people. And the thing of it is, is that building up another airport off the coast is something you should consider. Yeah, it's going to take time and money, but that's that's life and, you know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, in other words, I'm not against expansion, but trying to put an lax over in that hole where L.A., Long Beach is, it's, you know, lots of luck with that. You know, it's not a matter of if a plane is going to fall on Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a matter of when.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I sure as hell don't want to be under it. If you drop it in the ocean, that's a better chance of survival anyway. And so and that's my pitch, you know. In other words, put a noise monitor in the South by Southwest like you're supposed to so you can monitor the system and think about maybe putting'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that you could work with Orange County. They could probably between here in Long Beach, build up something off the coast, a real airport like Hong Kong, like it's already been done. It's not in science fiction, it's already been done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that way you can have your international airport, you can make a gazillion dollars, have a future for the kids in the future and give these kids 15 bucks an hour.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. So that closes public comment on I'm on another item. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think studies are important. And I'm not saying that anyone here or at least I'm not committing to voting yes or no on the FISA. But I believe in what the very first woman said, which is a study is really important to know the viability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Airport Director Do you believe that this study has greater impact than to any one carrier? Would you elaborate on that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A Council on mango. We we do believe that in terms of the users of this facility, should it come to fruition at some point in the future, it would extend beyond a single carrier in JetBlue. It is true that JetBlue submitted a formal request to my attention at the end of February, which is what began this process'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that we are here to discuss this evening and consider. However, we do believe that there will be other beneficiaries at the airport in terms of others of of our tenant mix, including the general aviation community Gulfstream, which has a major completion center there on the West Coast operation for the completion of their aircraft.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we do believe that there will be other users beyond JetBlue for for that facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's interesting, you mentioned Gulfstream. They've increased employees by, I believe, 200 this year with all high paying jobs. Would you say that when this study comes back, should it not be beneficial to the city that this would potentially put the item of the international terminal as a know to rest forever?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or at least the imaginable long term future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, so I certainly wouldn't say forever, but. But what I would like to see is the results of the study. And and that, I think, will be very telling in terms of giving you the council the information that you need to make the informed decision as to whether to proceed with the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is nothing in this scope that will include design. They will look at potential sites for the fires to be located on. They would look at things in terms of potential scale, but there will be no design of a facility itself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would come back to council with the full results of this study before any of those determinations would be made and those will be made by you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Councilmember Austin did an excellent job about six months ago when we discussed this previously of ensuring the robust nature of the study. Have all items requested by Council Member Austin been included?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, they happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. Well, when we voted on this before, my position was that data is good, it's always good. And I prefer to make decisions based on all of the data that we have, rather than speculation on many things that that come before us, especially things that happened in my district.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I don't see that this is going to be any different in terms of the process. Unlike one of the previous speakers, I had no illusion whatsoever that this study was going to cost five or $10,000. I mean, it costs more for us to study whether or not we should extend read curbing on a street by feet'",
        "'speaker_12': 'or two. So there was no to me, the cost of the study isn't shocking by any stretch of the imagination, given the scope of the study. So I'm not concerned about the financial commitment because I think much like many of the major studies that we do that impact policy decisions for the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's an important study and I want to make sure that it has a very broad scope so that everyone's interests are accounted for. So I'm going to be supporting this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I think my my position is pretty clear on this. It has been from the very beginning. I have some significant and serious reservations, and I voted against the study to begin with. I don't think I can be supportive of it again today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That said, I do have some some questions before I make my comments. And the first one is for the city attorney. Can you discuss how the components that are being conducted through your office, namely the risk assessment of the potential threats to noise ordinance and the plan to mitigate impact in neighborhoods in schools be conducted or incorporated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'into the feasibility study. How are you guys going to go about conducting this in-house? Do you plan on doing it with outside counsel?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman Austin Members of the City Council. Our current plan is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Review the draft of the report before it's made public. Work with the outside consultant if we need to do that to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Make a determination. As you know, our office is very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Familiar with the contents of the ordinance. We've been working with it even before it was adopted in.'",
        "'speaker_5': '1995, so we feel very comfortable with it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we feel that we do need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Technical expertize from outside counsel, as one of the speakers indicated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have used the law firm a great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Skill and balance in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The past for issues like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are also very familiar with the city of Long Beach Airport, the Long Beach Noise Compatibility Ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if necessary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Would probably hire them to provide additional assistance if we need it. But really, we're going to take a hard look at the report itself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before we formulate an opinion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think Mr. Francis mentioned that the report will come back and he expected it back in July.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so with the additions, I guess, do we plan on getting all this information back at once or will it come back?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And based.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On your previous.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Direction, it's our understanding that we would present, in effect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A joint report. There would be a report by staff and the consultant, and our office would contribute to that by way of either a separate paper on the issue and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of course oral presentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As well. So we would do it at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. That is helpful. Um, and Mr. Francis, in 2015, revenues at the airport were significantly down from the previous year, and I believe it was down more than $2 million from what was budgeted in that year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct. Okay. And so the council's budget performance report last summer, the council was told that the airport fund revenues are directly impacted by the number of employments at the Lombard Airport. So that said, declining employment numbers over the past few years have been negatively impacted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that was the negatively impacted revenues. I think that was one of your quotes. That's correct. I believe these revenue trends are continuing this year for the airport as well. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, actually, our employment levels have stabilized, so but it doesn't really provide for recovery because we're not yet seeing an increase in passenger activity as we have in previous years. So so we will still see, we believe, revenues that are slightly off from what they were last year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There have been some adjustments in rates and charges for this year, and that certainly will compensate for for a good, good portion of what would have otherwise been declining revenues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with the decline in revenues, do you. I think that $350,000 study is prudent. But the story.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe that in terms of giving us the in-depth analysis from many angles that is warranted for a project of this magnitude, I do believe it's prudent. We have continued to report a surplus in terms of our overall budgeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we we still have an excess of revenues to expenses. But what we've been seeing is a decline in the overall revenue levels. So we still are reporting surpluses in our revenue stream. And I do believe that this will be a prudent project for us to move forward with in terms of the feasibility study itself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And so so I think we may just just disagree on that. I mean, I think, you know, when you lose your money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Kind of difficult to to justify spending that type of money. But, um, I would prefer what similar sized cities have international airports.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So just off the top of my head in California, Fresno is an airport in state that has an FAA. They have several flights to Mexico, various destinations in Mexico. Also Tucson, Arizona, Birmingham, Alabama. So just to name a few cities that are are about the same size of of Long Beach, but also have international facilities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just this is just a question out of curiosity. I know it's a little off topic. I'm sorry, but do what type of commercial aircraft do they are able to use be use it at Long Beach Airport. Given our current current terminal constraints.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the the design aircraft, the largest aircraft that we would see on a routine basis would be of the 757 variety or Airbus 321, which is the roughly 180 to 200 passenger aircraft on. Under special circumstances, we could accommodate a very small widebody aircraft.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But there really is no provision for that facility to handle large widebody aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 or Airbus three eighties, very large, you know, 4 to 500 passenger aircraft. Those cannot be be handled or accommodated at the existing facility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I think international flight, I think big, big planes just that's just me. So I'll just have some quick remarks. As I said, when this issue came before the council last July, I strongly believe now and continue to believe that the quality of life of our residents is the paramount factor that should be determined as this council'",
        "'speaker_4': 'takes action. And I'm not prepared to expose our city or our neighborhoods to any significant risk when the economic reward to the city appears to be minimal or nonexistent. Opening the door to international flights creates a whole new potential risk, too, of a challenge to our very, very precious noise ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and as I read the newspaper, I look at cities across the the particularly in Burbank recently. They are trying to accomplish what we have in our noise ordinance and at least having a curfew. That's something that we also should be very mindful of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The former airport director memorial, Mel Rodriguez, in a memo in 2013 told the city council that future revenues from FISA would only serve to mitigate the cost of the facility and not further enhance the airport's financial position. And so, given the significant cost to even undertake this feasibility study when the airport is facing declining revenues, I believe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is not financially responsible to continue down this path. The risk, I believe, outweigh the rewards. And I'll repeat that again. And so with that, I would like to make a substitute motion to receive and file this motion. Of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be me. Thank you, Councilmember Austin. And we have Councilmember Sue. I'm sorry, Councilmember Your Honor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Just a few. Well, just one quick question. For me, it's very simple. Fresno, Birmingham and Tucson, you say, are international have international airports. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, sir, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How close in proximity are they to other airports that have a similar size or have or offer international flights? That's another state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those three are probably about 100 miles away. I should have added that. Of course, Santa Ana Orange County Airport has the Federal Inspection Service facility as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. When it comes down to Long Beach. You know, I think that we're looking at. Adding international flights. We're talking about adding flights in proximity to Orange County, Los Angeles. Ontario, I think, has international flight, if I'm not mistaken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yet, you know, here we are within, I would say, what, 50 miles of those cities, less with Orange County and L.A.. And yet we want to create a an international facility here. It just doesn't make sense to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But also doesn't make sense is that when we're looking at the spending of $350,000, that can be used towards fixing sidewalks, cutting trees. Using staff for other purposes and security. We have a marijuana issue becoming a pretty soon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're talking about how are we going to find that? Why? Here's $350. We could be use it for that. I mean, it doesn't make sense to me when we're looking at another study spending money in something that apparently is is is a a fait accompli based on how it's worded and what the expectations are going to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'coming back to us. I said this many months ago when I offered. Let me rephrase it when I did not support this item back then, and I don't support it now. We don't need a feasibility study. We have a great airport.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If any A-frame broke, don't fix it. If we need if revenue is an issue where we need to make more revenue, then let's talk about a business plan for what we have at the airport to increase revenue. You know, we're talking about the change of a business plan that goes from east to west or west to east'",
        "'speaker_3': ', going north and south. But yet, when we talk about those, the business plan that goes east to west, west to east, we're cutting flights. We're not increasing flights. We're cutting flights. And that doesn't make any sense to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, I haven't seen any reports that would support cutting back flights. You know, I know that I can use more flights to D.C. directly from Long Beach being that, you know, I go there as is at least twice or three times a year sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that we can use more flights to Sacramento, which would be fit in with a North-South flight plan. There's only one flight per day. And it's and it's in the middle of the morning. In the middle of the afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Totally inconvenient. Thank you for for making meetings that I might have in Sacramento. So, I mean, it's instead of looking at creating an office, let's look at our airport in terms of creating more flight opportunities. So I'm not going to be supporting this issue, but I will support the receiver file.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Superdome.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And Councilmember Mongeau referenced the first speaker, and that was Laura Selmer from the fourth District. What I'd like to do, I think you've answered this question, but I'd like to frame it the way Laura did, and that is why not adjust the scope of the study so it's less money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if you could just address it in those terms, I appreciate it. Yes, sir. We worked very diligently with Jacobs to refine the scope to what you have before you today. As I mentioned, there are six areas, none of which are design.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One is market analysis. The second is airport scoping and capability. The third is financial feasibility. The fourth is economic impact. The fifth is assessment of environmental impact, and last is security risk assessment. And as I mentioned, there is also the component that the city attorney's office will be covering.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is to look at the feasibility, financial and otherwise of this type of project taking place at the airport. The previous study that was done in 2013 was only a financial feasibility study, just one of the six components that are going to be covered by Jacobs with this study.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is certainly more robust, but it takes a more full look at what the project would look like. All of the components that need to be considered that the council would would, I believe, benefit from having the information to make that future decision.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So again, the scope has been refined to the point that it is in today. And we believe that what we brought forward is fitting for the type of project that is before you. Okay. Thank you. And I'm going to confuse two issues here purposely, because I get asked this question almost daily.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is something different on the table than we had last July, and that is the additional flight slots. So if you would just indulge, just please. Approximately how many flights do we have on a daily basis right now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So today, with the 41 air carrier slots and 25 commuter slots, we have roughly 40 departures per day. Presently of of 66 possible today. Okay. So 40 of 66. So if you filled all those slots and added nine plus, what would your total number be?'",
        "'speaker_7': '75. Okay. So that's that's the threat today that that it wasn't in July when this first came before us. It's affirmative. So so there are there separate completely separate items. The one is due to the noise ordinance and the noise analysis that is conducted annually.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is what has resulted in the airport actually having room available in the air carrier budget for the last four years, which is what caused us to take the action that we presented to you in the study session on December 8th to increase the air carrier slots from 41 to 50.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The in terms of the the slots, the 41 and 25 slots, the 25 commuter slots, quite frankly, there's not much demand for them. As of today, only three of those 25 slots are allocated. And it really is just a function of the way that airlines operate today and the limitations that are placed on aircraft in that category'",
        "'speaker_7': 'by weight. So there's just not very much demand for those 25 slots in the present industry the way that airlines operate today. I don't really foresee that we will have many of those slots all of a sudden have interest from carriers for allocation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So really, it's the air carrier category that we're concerned with. The 41 is growing to 50 through the process that we presented last month. Right. And thank you for that clarification. And I understand it. But my constituents impacted by the airport see it as a real threat.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They see more flight slots and changing the business model of the airport and that all those slots could potentially be filled. So that that's I just wanted to get that on the record. That's what I'm hearing from my constituents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd like to thank my colleagues. Mr. Austin, thank you for asking all the questions that I had on my mind. He obviously knows this topic very well, and I appreciate it. Just one point of clarification for Roberta. Your comment on the money being used for other purposes, those moneys have to stay at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We all understand that. But a waste of money is a waste of money, if that's what the speakers were saying here tonight. So they did it eloquently. I won't add to that. So I'd like to thank my colleagues for their words.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would like to thank the speakers for being here tonight. And I don't want to say I won't be supporting this because there's a substitute motion on the table here. So we'll wait to see what happens. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Mayor. Council members, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do want to echo what Councilmember Supernova said earlier. We talked about the dollars.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Potentially could go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To police, fire streets, Rosa. That's absolutely not the case. These are enterprise fund dollars that can only be spent on airport related issues. And I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmembers who were not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kotsenburg give anything awesome. Look, vice me with them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank Councilmember Supernova for clarifying how enterprise funds can be spent. So thank you for doing that. And I agree with you. While it is not allowed to spend any enterprise funds on general fund activities, if it were a waste of money, it's something that we should not support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have always supported. Our ability to have access to knowledge and information and data. And I continue to support that. And I believe this is something that we must do and that we should do. I don't believe it's a fait accompli and not for me personally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't come to this conversation with that in mind. And I appreciate the staff recommending the direction of the study and appreciate Councilmember Price's reminder that a simple study just in our neighborhoods costs tens of thousands of dollars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I had no expectations of this to cost anything less than what it does. And I'll be supporting that. And I ask my colleagues to vote no on the substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to thank staff and particularly I want to thank my colleague to the right, councilman austin. He's done a he and Councilmember U ranga and councilmember super nice have done a really good job at keeping this issue alive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I believe in a process. I believe that I'll make a decision ultimately in the end. But in all those scenarios, I need facts and I need data. So the truth is, I don't want to pick and choose my methodology on how I make decisions, make certain decisions without actually allowing the process to evolve.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Hearing out here and everyone to make their case. So this is no different. I'm going to support the the main motion and I'll make an ultimate decision once I see the facts in front of me. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. There is a substitute motion on the floor, which is a received file by Councilman Austin. And then depending on that, will go to the next motion, which was the original motion by Councilman Mongo, depending on the vote of the substitute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So all those in favor of the substitute motion, please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion fails.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, now we have the main motion, which is to approve the recommendation to move forward as made by Councilman Mongo and Councilwoman Price. Members, please go and cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. I know there might be a few folks outside that are trying to get in, so I'm going to take just a one minute to minute recess. So folks that need to go can go. And if there are folks that are trying to come in, the next item up is the minimum wage item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if there are folks in need to come in, let them try to find some seats. So just take a one or two minute recess and let the adjustment happen and let staff prepare for the presentation. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're going to I'm going to call a meeting back to order here so I can just have everyone. Please take a seat. I'm going to go and call this meeting back to back to order. So if I can get Madam Clerk to do the roll call, and if I can, everyone else, please grab a seat.'"

        "'speaker_13': 'There was scope, as you saw, we did review the literature related to minimum wage policy in municipalities at the state level and both theoretical, academic and empirical evidence as to the effects. We did look at other policies that have been implemented in other municipalities and where they were going.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We estimated the impact in Long Beach on both employees and employers and we conducted a survey of Long Beach businesses. And as one said, we did attend every open forum meeting to hear the comments that were provided by both the residents, workers and the business owners.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So just to start talking about Long Beach residents and the characteristics, just a few data points that the report does have quite a lot of data, but rather than than spend a lot of time on that, I just wanted to share some of them with you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The age distribution is kind of an interesting data point that we like to look at because it gives you an indication of whether the city is growing within or not. If you have a large, younger population, these are going to age into it working adults.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so we see that 70% of the residents here in Long Beach are working age. 15 to 64. Actually, the age distribution in Long Beach is not much different than L.A. County. The reason we compared this to L.A. County is because in many of our meetings, we heard that the characteristics of the City of Long Beach was'",
        "'speaker_13': 'different than elsewhere. And actually, we found that it's not that much different from the L.A. County average. In fact, you're a little bit younger. Yeah. Household by size. This is another indication potentially of the standard of living. There's 162,000 households in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The, you know, a larger number of households, a percentage of households with many residents might indicate a lower the standard of living. Again, here we find that Long Beach, the average household size, is 2.87 residents, which is less than the L.A. County average of three.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Households by income. The median household income in Long Beach is $54,511 compared to the Los Angeles County average, our median of 55,746. So it's a little bit lower, but not so significantly lower budget expenditures. We like to look at this because, again, we hear everywhere in the Southland that housing consumes a large portion of people's household budgets'",
        "'speaker_13': '. And this is quite true. In Long Beach, the average household expenditures are just less than $70,000 compared to the L.A. larger L.A. Orange County region of about 79,000. Almost 38% is consumed in housing, almost 14% in transportation costs, and 12% in food.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Now there are many employed residents. And what do they do? We separate these out into three different categories of occupations white collar, blue collar and services. So white collar is really sales, office management and professional type of work.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Blue collar is construction, production and transportation and services is repair and maintenance. Food prep and serving. Community Services. Office and administrative. And architects, actually. So this distribution of occupation, occupational type of employment for the residents of Long Beach is also very similar to the larger Los Angeles County average.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We look at poverty levels as well, the individual poverty level here. This is a ratio of income to poverty level. Individuals who live in a household household income determines a poverty rate. So any individual in a household is in poverty.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Is is in poverty. The individual poverty rate in Long Beach is 21.1%, which is higher than Los Angeles County. Approximately 17.7% of households in Long Beach live below the poverty level. And I think you will hear that the poverty level is is quite low and very difficult to live on.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So that's the residential characteristics. But we also like to see what kind of jobs here are provided by businesses. So this is showing firms and employment by size of of of employer, by size of company. So we have very small firms, 1 to 4 or 5 to 9, 10 to 19.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the blue bars are showing how many firms there are in these business sizes. And the the the beige bars are showing what percentage of jobs are in those companies. So, for example, very small firms, 1 to 4 employees account for 54% of all firms in language, but only 7.6% of employment.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that makes sense if there is a small firm doesn't have as many employees for the aggregate, IT firms with between one and 19 employees account for 84% of firms and 26% of employees. So this is important when you think about considering what a small businesses and how how many employees the policy might impact.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The employment by industry. This is also quite typical of a municipality. The largest industry sector is education and health. This is mostly social assistance, mostly health, but most of that is social assistance. Professional and business services includes a wide range of different jobs and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The government sector is fairly large here in Long Beach. Leisure and hospitality is also quite significant. That, of course, is mostly restaurants. Food, food, food prep and serving retail trade typically takes up approximately 10% of employment. So they're not.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'All jobs in Long Beach are held by Long Beach residents. So this shows us where the workers who work in Long Beach actually live. So of all the people who work in Long Beach, 25.8% live in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': '11% live in the city of L.A.. Another 31% live in other parts of L.A. County and so on. That the number of of actual workers in Long Beach who live in Long Beach is about 42,700. So this is 165,000 jobs.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Approximately 74% are held by outsiders. We can look at the flip side of that, where we see where long people who live in Long Beach, where do they work? And there's about approximately 186,000 people who live in Long Beach and work somewhere and 77% of them commute elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So these are kind of important considerations as you think about what kind of a policy you're going to implement. We did estimate the potential impact of a minimum wage increase at the time when we did the study. There wasn't a policy that was actually developed or proposed, so we assumed that a policy similar to that recently adopted'",
        "'speaker_13': 'by L.A. City and L.A. County would be the one that you would be considering. And that one, you know, did go from ten, 1050 in July of this year to $15 in 2020. So, of course, in order to do that, we have to assume a certain number of wage growth over time and job growth over time.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And we also assume that when you raise the minimum wage to whatever level it is, $12, say the people who had been earning $12 already, would also receive some increase. As as as you move up the scale so that there was a wage compression effect.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So this were these were our estimates for the cumulative impacts of the minimum wage increase that we saw at $12, which would have been implemented in 2017. The number of job holders impacted in Long Beach would be approximately 33,000.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That would represent approximately 18.5% of all job holders in the city. An average annual increase in earnings of each individual would be on average, $940 a year. And the aggregate increase in the wage bill for all those workers, including those subject to wage compression, was $30.9 million that we did also estimate for 2020.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And those numbers are, of course, higher. So in the best case and I'll talk about that in just a moment. If all existing earners or workers who were minimum wage received this increase in earnings. 33,000 workers would earn an average of $940 more more per year at $12 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And 45,700 workers would earn an average of approximately 5000 per year, which is a significant increase. So well the impact on workers, then we would assume and can expect that some will earn more and will spend more. They may work harder because they're earning more and they will probably be happier.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'More people may join the local the local labor market because they would be induced to join the market at a higher wage rate. And perhaps it's it would offset additional costs for transportation. But some may be pushed out of the out of work in the formal market or may have to work informally if they have to compete'",
        "'speaker_13': 'with better workers at those rates. So we also know that an increase in labor costs is going to be an increase in business costs. So the aggregate wage bill for $12 per hour at a minimum would be approximately 30.9 million in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's going to be have to be borne by businesses. And again, more at $15. This does not include other wage related costs, such as workers comp or payroll taxes, which could probably add another 10 to 15%. Well, employers, you adjust.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They are faced with an increase in costs. There are just a number of channels they can choose. They can pass cost increases through to their customers through increased prices. They can choose to increase the productivity of their workers.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And there's a couple of ways they can do that. They could hire better skilled employees or they could assist their current employees with better machinery, replace them with some machines to some extent. So those are ideas of how businesses might improve the productivity of their labor at a higher cost.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They could reduce costs. But as many businesses have probably said, if there were costs that they could reduce, they would have done so already. So when they're thinking about reducing costs from an increase in labor costs, they'll likely try to offset that with a reduction in other labor costs, such as benefits or overtime, and they can absorb'",
        "'speaker_13': 'costs through reduced profits. If they can't find an adjustment mechanism and their costs are increasing, they're just going to take a hit. So if we think about that, the worst case. 14,000 workers are directly at risk of losing hours or jobs or being substituted if that if the minimum wage was $12.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'These are directly affected workers. These aren't the ones that are or that would be impacted through wage compression. And 20,700 workers would be at risk of losing hours or jobs or being substituted at $15. And we really don't know how much that would what the balance would be here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So Long Beach businesses did reply to our survey. It was the goal was really to to learn what their perspective reactions would be. It was a telephone survey. 600 completed surveys were received. The survey was segmented by firm size because their responses might have been different for smaller companies and larger companies.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We also segmented by geographic region because we did hear that the South Long Beach businesses were different than the North Long Beach businesses. I will say that a lot of the responses were in undecided. They really didn't understand, didn't have an idea for sure of how they would respond.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The results were a 95% confidence interval with a sampling error of plus or -4.1%, which is a little bit larger of a sampling error for the subsegments when we when we break it down. So what did the businesses believe that they will do with their workforce, or how many will this one here?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'How many actually have minimum wage workers? 40% of respondents have minimum wage workers. This is kind of interesting. 60% of respondents did not have minimum wage workers. The current minimum wage, which at that time was $9, but another 27%, did have workers between nine and 1325, which is the next step.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we were asked to provide results. Weighted by firm size. So these I'm showing these results as well. They did not significantly change. We could have weighted it as well by respondents that actually had minimum wage workers, or we could have weighted it by the geographic location of the firms.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But we we reported all the results. Most minimum wage workers in Long Beach are full time and most of them are permanent. How would businesses? Would they reduce employment? 67% of respondents said they would not reduce their number of minimum wage workers.'",
        "'speaker_13': '30%, although, were undecided. 76% of respondents said they would not reduce the hours of their minimum wage workers, and the remaining were undecided. And 78% of respondents said they would not invest in automation. And 20% of those were also undecided.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'How about relocation or closure? We often hear that businesses will move to another location to avoid the minimum wage policy. 80% of respondents said they would not relocate their business. The remainder were undecided. 100% of respondents, reflecting the perennial optimism of business owners, said they will not close their business.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There were no undecideds in this category. 89% of respondents do not expect their profits to increase. Would they increase their prices? 70% of respondents said they would increase their prices. 78% believe the minimum wage workers will be happier and more productive, and 49% will add duties to their current workers.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So in the aggregate, we know that some workers will be paid more. Some businesses will face higher costs. But there really is no definitive evidence supporting the balance of effects so that we can find out at what level everyone is made better off.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I'd just like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. One is the idea that hiring better skilled workers over the lesser skilled workers is probably going to impact those with the least skills the most. And those are the ones that we'd like to help the best.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There has been there will continue to be a long term trend towards automation and efficiency. As we have seen through the 20th century and the 21st century, we're just becoming so much more automated. And additionally, marginal firms facing increased business costs will close and those remaining will be more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And you do have to think about the regional dynamics as there are other constituents, other municipalities in your region that will impact the results in your city. So not all firms can raise their prices if they have competition right across the border.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And you will be competing for labor, you will be able to choose more labor, but you will have to compete for the best. So just a few notes about the open forums and I attended every one of them.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The first three forums before the release of the study, there were approximately 50 speakers, half in favor of or speaking on behalf of workers and half speaking on behalf of business. There were three more after the release and approximately 80 speakers.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There were the ratio of workers interest versus business interests was about 2 to 1. Several individuals spoke at multiple forums, and the general themes were very consistent. The employees and workers, if you have been at them, you will have heard many personal stories of hardship, difficulty of making ends meet, working long hours, how more income would impact'",
        "'speaker_13': 'their lives and their families. You would have heard many discussion of misclassification and wage theft issues, which are clearly illegal. You would have heard that raising wages would impact local spending. You would have heard students and nonprofit organizations.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Speak out against exemptions. And by the the last few meetings, you would have heard consistently about the Long Beach way, which was a coalescing around four major themes $15 wage paid sick days, no exemptions and city led enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Similarly, had you attended them and heard all of the speakers, you would have heard the small businesses feel. Small business owners often feel as if they are at one with their employees. They have very thin profit margins and would find it difficult to absorb higher costs.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Nonprofits express a great deal of concern about their reimbursements, which may be fixed so they wouldn't be able to raise their costs and their service levels may be impacted. Price increases and reduced employment. These were common responses that businesses faced and expressed.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Restaurant owners spoke out frequently about their tipped employees and not having full compensation considered as a minimum wage and leveling the playing field. Excuse me was also heard quite frequently too. To make this a statewide issue. Rather than a competition between jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I think that's broadly the study.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you, Christine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I know we're going to have questions from the council on the study. And as soon as we finish up this part of the city presentation, we're gonna go back to you, doctor. Then we'll go. Will continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So back to see stuff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Go ahead. Yeah. Oh, Christine has it.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'On January six, 2016, the Economic Development Commission met to consider all relevant data and testimony and deliberate over benefits, deficits and unintended consequences of a minimum wage policy by a unanimous vote. The Economic Development Commission moved to forward the following recommendations to the City Council for its consideration of a minimum minimum wage policy in the city of'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Long Beach beginning January 1st, 2017. The minimum wage shall be 1050 per hour beginning January 1st, 2018. The minimum wage shall be $12 per hour beginning January 1st, 2019. The minimum wage shall be $13 per hour. Small businesses and nonprofit corporations shall receive a one year delay in implementation.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And small businesses are defined as 25 or less employees. In addition, the Economic Development Commission requests the City Council's consideration of the following items in its discussion that the City Council will take a leadership role in seeking to change state legislation regarding tipped employees and evaluate whether this can be controlled at the local level.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Consideration for sick days and wage theft enforcement. Consider requesting a report to be presented to City Council in 2021, evaluating the impacts of a minimum wage policy following full implementation to consider and explore actions that would help mitigate negative effects on businesses and training programs resulting from a higher minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The Department of Financial Management analyze the potential risks and fiscal impact to the city of a minimum wage ordinance, as there is no concurrent ordinance. In effect, major assumptions were made due to limitations of available data in order to estimate the fiscal impact.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The analysis assumes the adoption of an ordinance mirroring that of the city of Los Angeles for areas where analyzes staff costs, contract costs, enforcement costs and small business incentive costs. At a $15 per hour minimum wage. The structural increase from fiscal year 17 to fiscal year 21 for staff costs is estimated at 1.5 million and all funds'",
        "'speaker_14': '1.4 million of which is in the general fund. These are costs due to increasing city employee salaries to minimum wage. Contract cost impact is potentially between 1.8 and 3.2 million in all funds approximately 339000 to 531000 of which is in the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'These are costs from city contractors potentially passing on their increased costs for staffing. Enforcement options fall into three categories. Option one is state enforcement providing minimal fiscal impacts to the city. Option two is a combination of state enforcement, augmented with city efforts and communication, outreach and support.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Option to fiscal impacts are estimated between 431,000 and 725,000. Option three contemplates a support and enforcement model based on the county's model. Option three fiscal impacts are estimated at 1.3 million. Incentive programs fall into two categories. Incentives to only new small businesses provide for a fiscal impact estimated at 444,000.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Incentives to all small businesses provide for a fiscal impact estimated at 4.1 million. Tonight's recommendation proposes a minimum wage of up to $13 per hour by 2019. By 2012, for small businesses and non-profits, the total structural increases from fiscal year 17 to fiscal year 21 of a 13 per hour minimum wage are as follows.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Staff costs are estimated at 850,303. In all funds, 798000 to 54, of which is in the general fund. Contractor costs are estimated between 558,001.2 million. In all funds, approximately 115 to 202000, of which is in the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There is no change to previous estimates for enforcement or incentive programs, depending on the actual provisions of any proposed minimum wage policy. City staff will review and revise the fiscal impacts accordingly. This concludes our report for this evening.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I would like to thank Chair Colonna and the members of the Economic Development Commission, the staffs of Long Beach City College, the Expo Art Center, Admiral Kidd Park, the Bay Shore Neighborhood Library, the Department of Technology and Innovation.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The Office of the City Clerk and the members of the Long Beach community for their participation in this endeavor. At this time, Christine Cooper from the Landsea, Leah Ericson from the Department of Financial Management and I are available for any questions.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me let me just start, obviously, by thanking city staff. I want to thank particularly the L.A. EDC for the incredible work you guys did and a lot of work. And we appreciate that. And of course, everyone that was involved in the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of the the the advocates, the workers, the businesses, the students, everyone that came to a hearing, whether it was a roundtable or a larger discussion. I want to thank you all as we as we begin this discussion tonight, what I'd like to do right now is I have a someone that's cued up the vice president who'",
        "'speaker_0': 'actually introduced the original motion. And vice mayor, if there's no objection, I'd like to see first if the council has questions of the L.A., EDC or staff on the report so we can kind of get through all of those questions first and then before we move on to you and to the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you okay with that? Okay. So let me begin. I'm just going to read as you've queued up here, if there are questions or you can stay in the queue for for the future. But I'll just go through these.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me start let me start here. Councilman Richardson, you have any questions at this point for L.A. EDC?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm okay with your direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So, Councilman Mongeau.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I guess I would need some direction on if this is for L.A. EDC or if it's for our own city attorney. I received several emails to my office and interacted with many members of the community, even at some of the forums, requesting a discussion regarding the concept of total earnings as an exemption.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there any court cases on the concept for or against total earnings? And could you advise us a little bit about what that means?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's a question for Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mayor and members of the council. The the short answer is no. There are no cases on point that would say that you could do a total earnings exemption. On the other hand, there's no cases on point that say you can't do it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The the the most recent version of the total there was a total earnings exemption and a lot of cases. Not a lot, but several of the cases talk about a tip credit and whether a credit is is legal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there's various opinions on that one. The Legislative Council opinion, which was asked when City of Sacramento was considering something similar, said that they thought that that would be preempted under the law. They did also say in their opinion, though, that there are no specific cases on point, but that was the opinion of the Legislative Council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The most recent proposal varies a little bit. It talks about a total earnings exemption. Our officers met only once. We just recently received this proposal on January, I believe it was seventh. We had one meeting with the attorney who was suggesting that this is a possible alternative.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But even he admits there are no cases that support that. This is his opinion. It does take into account total wages as it's as he was proposing it. The minimum wage standard established under a total earnings exemption would apply to any employee whose total earnings for the pay period, or at least the amount specified in the local'",
        "'speaker_10': 'minimum wage. And then when you apply that, if it doesn't equal that during the pay period, then the employer would have to make up the difference. And total earnings would include tips and wages if that person that under this scenario would be a waiter or a working at a restaurant that was tipped employee, maybe a different type'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of tipped employee. It would also include other types and classifications of employees. So for the enforcement, setting aside the enforcement issues, which could be significant if you're looking at this every pay period and then maybe two weeks, they don't meet the minimum wage and they have to be made up in the next two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They do. If you do it during the month, over a month, then you average it. There's some issues there. But but bottom line, no other city has adopted this type of an exemption in California that we could find.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there is no case law that says you absolutely could do it. So it would be subject to a challenge, I believe. And and I don't know what the courts would rule on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You mentioned that it would apply to many different types of employees. I imagine things like delivery services, those are very popular in the new economy services such as nails and hair and all of those. I do see it being a broad group of employees, probably a large number that lie in the 1 to 4 employee range.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As mentioned in the latest report, I have only heard about this directly from people who came to the forums. I did not meet with any Fed attorney and I would since you did. What would be the qualifications of said attorney and why would they be any different from our own attorneys?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do they have a background in labor law or. I don't really know. I mean, I received a letter from several different attorneys offices.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's absolutely correct. The there are many opinions out there on both sides of this issue that have been presented to our office. This attorney presented his opinion. He portrays himself as an expert in the labor and wage law area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have no reason to doubt that. But it is a different proposal than what other cities have looked at. This is new, as I said. And so it is his concept that we were looking at. We were just asked to look at various proposals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So one of the things that I think I've mentioned before, but it's a new year, so a new time to mention it is that I was very active in my employment through the VOA program, formerly known as the We Are program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there have always been some disadvantages in California in terms of that federal allocation of funding for youth employment programs is based on ours at the federal minimum wage. And so California employers and California youth specifically are disadvantaged because we are not apportioned a greater amount of funding in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Proportion to what the variance in our minimum wage. So I know that I brought that up at Federal Legislative Committee. I hope that we will pursue that in our upcoming federal legislative trip so that entities that choose to make these steps towards pulling people out of poverty are rewarded, not disadvantaged, when getting federal allocations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That being said, until we pass said opportunities or get the federal discretionary funds or distribution of funds related to that changed, what are we able to do in terms of a youth wage in Long Beach, where I know there are some differences in the federal opinion?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know sometimes it goes up to age 24, sometimes it only goes to age 21 based on if there are foster youth and sometimes only 18 if they're not disadvantaged at all. What would be the thoughts on a youth wage in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Either studying it at the state minimum wage or at 85% of whatever we do end up passing so that our our youth are not as disadvantaged and our federal funding can stretch as far as possible. I know we've worked so hard to gain the doubling of these internships, paid internships, many of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would be remiss to think that those youth would not be given those opportunities should the wage go up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There are other California cities who do have a youth wage exemption or a, as you said, a percentage for a certain number of hours worked. Or there are different options that are a policy decision for the council to adopt, which we believe would be allowed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope that we can talk about that more as the discussion goes on tonight. I know that specifically when we were doing allocation of funds by nonprofit organization that would help place these youth. One of the challenges we always had was that we would have to disperse that funding in allocation allotments that aligned with a certain number'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of hours that the Rio aboard the Wheat Board chose to be. Impactful in the youth's lives. You could cut the hours back to 5 hours a week for 11 weeks, but that's not the same experience that these youth could enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Should we be able to give them the 25 hours a week that we felt was a more robust plan in the Summer Youth Employment Program? And I know not only here in Long Beach and our strong Web board, but the L.A. County Web board, the South Bay switchboard, the the Lakewood and cities adjacent to us and the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'L.A. City Web Board. I know that we've all struggled with this. So I hope that members who have spoken to me about this from each of those boards have a proposal in mind, because I'd really like to find a way where our youth are brought into the workplace and then quickly escalate it up to the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But again, one of the important parts of this is those that are supporting families need to make a bit more. But if it's too high, then those entry level jobs aren't really available for people to step into those higher wages.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. Lastly, I think that I hope to hear from people today. I know L.A. EDC made a recommendation related to identifying how businesses can be helped with incentives. I've sat in on many meetings of other bodies who have passed the minimum wage ordinance related to what those incentives could be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm still forming some opinions on that, and I'd love to hear some creative ideas. And we've already offered people who start new businesses or grow their business in Long Beach waiving their business license fee for one year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think that we need something even more robust if you're going to continue to grow your business and meet the $15 an hour minimum wage or you currently have no employees at minimum wage, you're already paying above and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What can we do to reward those businesses so those that step out in front of those things and are really moving forward, bravo to them. And I look forward to hearing from my colleagues and the public. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Customer to Productivity Questions for Staff for the L.A. EDC.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Right off the bat. I'd just like to say that I've had a lot of questions about, well, why don't we wait to have something happen at the state level so we don't single out? I know we have a Sacramento lobbyist.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know we have intelligence there. Is there anyone on staff who can tell me what is on the horizon for the November ballot, possibly out of Sacramento?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. City Manager. And if not, I can chime in from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the issue of state minimum wage has been raised for several issues. It constantly comes up to this point. There has not been enough votes in the state legislature to put that on the ballot or to not even the ballot to pass it as a as a state law.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is always the opportunity to put it on a ballot. I don't personally have any knowledge of whether that's being circulated right now, but that's certainly something we can check into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, just to answer that, not to say anything that isn't already in the press. So feel free to look it up. So there's two two things that are happening in the state legislature right now. There will be a reintroduction of a statewide bill to go to $13 in the assembly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was actually a bill that was floating around last year. I'm sorry. I started on the Senate side, which is a mark Leno bill to go to $30 statewide that is being reintroduced in this session. And so that, I think is a dollar a dollar a year until you get to $13.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm pretty sure that's that's the details of it. But it it's it's a mark Leno originated bill that's happening in the legislature on the state referendum ballot side right now. There are two groups that are publicly are planning on filing measures, both of which go to $15.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One is a $15 at 2020 and the other is a $15 at 2021. There are some differences when it comes to sick days on those two measures. There are there are currently both competing measures and, of course, are going through the secretary of state requirement on signatures and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if those qualify and what is most likely but most of the commentators say is that the the two groups are will likely, if they work things out, combine and actually propose one ballot. And so having the two competing measures, but it is highly likely that you'll have one or two measures on the November 2016 ballot, at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'least that's what's been reported in, you know, in any of the press. And so that's the I think the status of the the assembly, the legislature and the state referendums.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Mr..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as Chair of the State Legislation Committee, I want to just point out that we do support the city of Long Beach is on record of supporting a minimum wage increase statewide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And back to Councilmember Super now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. I have another question that I get asked a lot is what is the impact to our general fund in terms of the city's own employees?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Calcium Councilman Supernova. The cost to the general fund is 1.4 million for the city's employees, and that would be a result of the employees currently below $15 going to $13. However, the cost is only.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But 800,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. And then just one final point, and I don't want to be nit picking, but it just struck me when Dr. Cooper framed the aggregate issue of the 30.9 million impact borne by employers. Because I'm a private sector business consultant, most people think of me talking about businesses, but this one jumps out at me that'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, if we're talking about home health care for fixed income seniors, if we're talking about daycare for working parents, if we're talking about home health care for disabled fixed income individuals, we're really talking about a wage increase that is borne by customers, individuals, not necessarily business.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I guess that's more of a comment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez. Any questions for.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, just a couple of questions. I want to first thank our city staff and L.A. EDC for this great report. I think the devil really is in the details. It's important that we really look at this information. It's very impactful.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so a couple questions for our city staff first. So what types of business incentives would be? Offered if we were to go through with a minimum wage incentive program. But it doesn't state exactly. I mean, is there any thought to what we'd be offering our business?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Gonzales. Some of the one of the things that we asked the EDC was to take a look at what other cities have looked at in the Lacey, L.A., EDC to come up with some recommendations. What they kind of found in their survey is there's a couple of common denominators that cities use in terms of financial incentives'",
        "'speaker_6': '. They didn't find that any city really offered any financial incentives, any of the other cities that we looked at through a telephone survey. But what they did look at are things like a shop local campaign or a business to business campaign, getting businesses to buy from other businesses in Long Beach so that we all those those dollars'",
        "'speaker_6': 'stay here. They also looked at expanding the preference program. Long Beach has a local preference program, but also expanding that to include hiring, educate educational institutions and seeing if they would participate as well. And then also to do some online tools and make it easier for businesses to interact with the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's something that we're actually very interested in and are working with our I-Team and our innovation team on. We've also provided some information for you in the packet to answer the questions about if the city were to provide a fiscal assistance, what would that cost are roughly, our business license is roughly about $400 for the average'",
        "'speaker_6': 'business, but we get about 11,000 businesses a year. So if we were to do a and a rebate, I believe it's about four and a half. $4.1 million if we were to do if we were do the majority of businesses in Long Beach, ultimately, if we were to do a smaller incentive, for example, one like a one'",
        "'speaker_6': 'year deferral for businesses, that could be for new businesses that could be around $450,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Great. And state enforcement. You know who would be our liaison here on the city side as far as which? I mean, with whatever option we were to go with, there would be have to be someone on our side to be able to to work with the state in that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So who would that be?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we looked at three different models for enforcement. One is very similar to Measure N, where it would essentially be really not much of a city role. The second would be creating a liaison type office. It would be in financial management where we would have roughly two people and some education and outreach staff and materials and assistance'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And then a third model would be actually having a full enforcement. So we we're recommending the middle model. Given just the state of the budget and that it's and we would have two employees that would be able to answer calls and help be that ombudsman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If somebody called and said, how do I have a problem? What do I do about it? We would be able to connect them with the Department of Industrial Relations, who would be who would do the enforcement and handle that as part of their workload?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, great. And then I have just one question for the L.A. EDC. I had been, of course, doing research and looking at the Congressional Budget Office information. They had pretty detailed information. I'm wondering if it's possible to project a lot of great information, but how many low wage employees would be would potentially be pulled out of poverty'",
        "'speaker_12': 'and go above the threshold if we were to increase the minimum wage? Do we have that number?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't have that number specifically for Long Beach residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. 1/2. I just want to make sure vast majority of everyone's being great. But please, there's no talking from the audience or.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are working people. We don't have to. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ma'am, I understand that. And fortunately, this is the public process. And so but I can't what I can't have is I can't have outburst during the hearing. And so please, ma'am, we just got to go through the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Time for the council so that the people can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ma'am, that we.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can get up to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Though. Ma'am. Ma'am, that's. Well, unfortunately, ma'am, we have to be respectful of the process. Okay?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We which is the public, the form.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We actually need to continue the meeting. And so we cannot continue those outbursts. I'm serious.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That that's the council will take its deliberative time and this public comment coming up. But I want to thank everyone else for being very respectful of the process so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Far to the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. So Council, ma'am, if you're not going to remain here, if you continue the outburst, we have to be respectful of process. So, Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, it's my last question. How many low wage employees would potentially be moved and go above the threshold if we have that information here, of course, in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we did not estimate that specifically. As we noted, a lot of Long Beach workers who would be impacted are not Long Beach residents. Okay. So it's a little bit of a difficult thing to estimate. Okay. And I would also say that many people in poverty don't work and so would not be impacted by a minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_13': 'policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, thank you for the information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, I have council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I'll be brief. I'll do my best. There were there were a couple of points that jumped out at me. And Dr. Cooper of the you mentioned a survey of 600 businesses, and there was a significant number of undecided.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if you gave us a percentage of undecided.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Each question actually had five choices. Very likely. Somewhat likely. Undecided or no answer? Not likely or not at all likely. So it was a five point scale. Each answer had a number of different undecided. And so, you know, when you look at the survey results, we not all respondents actually had minimum wage employees.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So many of them may not be impacted by the policy. So I think a lot of those answers fell into the undecided column.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. And I think the next question is for for Steph, there was a visual regarding staff costs for implementation of the minimum wage. And I'm curious to know exactly what those costs would be and how you came to that, those figures.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilman Austin. What we did was we estimated the number of employees who are currently below $15 and also $13. And then we looked at what the cost would be if they were placed within the minimum wage each respective year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so the incremental cost.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Starts out at just roughly $5,000 for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Next year of Y 17. And it grows each year to it gets to the 1.4 million in the general fund by a by 21 for $15 an hour and then.'",
        "'speaker_1': '800,000 for the $13 an hour. And that would be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'By FY 19.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And I guess that the the my, my, my final question would be how would the wages of workers who are engaged in collective bargaining be impacted by such a minimum wage policy?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, I don't believe that's part of your policy. So they would be not I mean, they would they would be affected, as is any other employee, as far as I know. I mean, I don't know what you've been.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, so.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Considering.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If someone belongs to an organization and they are covered under a collective bargaining agreement and those wages are negotiated in agree and such an agreement, does the minimum wage policy here supersede that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Unless you exempt them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I don't believe that's been suggested.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So just a couple quick questions for staff. Can you go over for us the recommendations that were presented to the Economic Development Commission from COBA?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Councilwoman Price, we don't have that report with us at this time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I have a copy of it. Well, I just wanted to make sure that that the copy that I have includes their full recommendations, because I'm not sure that that was included. I know that the ATC actually considered those recommendations in reaching their own recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. So I think it's important to kind of talk about it because that formed the basis of some of the discussion. So my understanding is that their recommendation was 1250 an hour over the course of five years. This wage includes medical benefits, paid sick days and paid time off.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'A one year delay for small businesses with under 25 employees. A two year delay for nonprofits. And then a youth training for 21 year old and younger workers to be paid at the state of California minimum wage rate.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Was there anything else that they included that that that I may have missed? If you know or if anyone knows.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kels.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Councilmember Price. Not to my recollection.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. The other question I had was I know we talked about. Organizations that have a set reimbursement rate, like a federal reimbursement rate. And we those were categorized under kind of a non profit category. Is there any category for businesses that provide a service that gets reimbursed by the federal government at a set rate, for example, health'",
        "'speaker_12': 'care industry? Did we give any consideration at all to mitigating the impacts of a minimum wage increase on those businesses?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think your current policy suggestion is for all nonprofits, so not a separate category for specific in-home services, I think is what you're.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. They wouldn't qualify as a nonprofit. They may not. Mm hmm. So in those situations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A question for staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Did the EDC consider those businesses at all? Because as we just saw from the report, the largest employment sector in our city is health and education. So a lot of those businesses and service providers rely on federal reimbursements at a set rate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Price I think a number of comments were made when Coba made their presentation to the EDC and also from a number of the forums that were presented and comments from the audience that indicated that there is concern among some of the state mandated firms that they would not be able to recover some of the cost because'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they were contracted for a period of time. And that information was communicated to the EDC. And those deliberations occurred over two rather extensive community meetings that occurred. So that was part of the deliberations. But I don't believe that it survived into the recommendations to city council.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. And then to the city attorney, this discussion that we're having about tipped employees and wage calculations for tipped employees. In light of the research, the legal research that you and your staff have done, could you take us down a realistic path?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What would be a foreseeable path for us if, in fact, we were we were to adopt a policy in that regard that no other city has adopted? What what could we as a council and the citizens of the city expect to see in terms of our future, 6 to 12 months?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If the decision of the council would be to include some sort of a tip credit, I believe for the foreseeable future we would be in litigation. The the issue is whether it violates Labor Code 351 and there are opinions on both sides and I will readily admit that there are some legal firms out there that believe that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it would be a legal path that the city could take. The more recent opinions that we've seen and it's our opinion that it it raises an issue of preemption with Labor Code 351 that the courts have not ruled on, that we would have to seek and defend it in the courts and probably through appeal in order to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'get a decision from the courts. The city of Long Beach could do that. The other option, of course, would be some sort of legislation to clarify the field. But there is not there isn't that benefit right now. So it's an unknown.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so a tip credit. I think there's more opinions out there now that believe it would be preempted. Mm hmm. The other issue, and I think some of the more recent opinions are not recognizing that, but but are going in a little bit a different direction, that that kind of moves away from the actual wording of tip'",
        "'speaker_10': 'credit or applying directly to just, you know, say, restaurant employees. But it's more tipped employees, not just restaurants, but for a total earnings exemption, which wants to look at the taxable earnings of that person and divide those earnings by the hours they worked and compare that to what it is that the minimum wage is in the local'",
        "'speaker_10': 'jurisdiction. That's also kind of a variation of it, but it is different. And there's also no legislation or case law that that identifies that and says that that's allowed by cities.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Now, in terms of the research that you've done, have you found that this this argument or this proposal has been made at other cities and rejected? Or is this a situation of first impression for the city of long, which I imagine not.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But what could you share with us?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think the answer is both. The tipped credit has been discussed specifically in the city of Sacramento. It was presented to the legislative. There was an opinion out of the legislative office that admits that there are no case law on it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But what felt that it would be preempted? I'm not sure exactly why the city of Sacramento decided not to adopt it, but they did not include it in their adoption of a local minimum wage. The total earnings exemption.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To my knowledge, has not been considered by other cities. I believe it was presented to the city of Pasadena, but I don't think that they've acted yet, and that's the only information of this particular one of the cities, that of local cities in California that have adopted a local minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No city has adopted either a tip credit or this total exemption earnings exemption.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that includes Santa monica with their recent vote.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, that is correct. They did not.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Customer. I think I would want to. You don't have any questions at this rate. Okay. Are there any other questions from councilmembers for the EDC or staff at this time? Okay. Perfect. And of course, this will be claim up to four more questions later on if we have if those come up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me turn this now over to. Thank you very much. And we'll continue the hearings. Let me now turn this over to the maker of the original motion on the issue, which was Vice Marie Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to thank everyone for being here today and for your patience, as well as Dr. Cooper for her presentation and our own staff, for their diligence and presentation of the hard work that they've done for these several months since we've made this motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As the mayor said, I had brought this motion forward a few months ago, and it is something that really is, in my opinion, the next installation or the next chapter of what our city has been doing for quite some time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I brought this motion forward back in August, we had great deliberation at that time, and the Council took action and instructed, instructed our staff to work with the L.A. EDC to conduct the study that they did. I want to first thank the council members who coauthored this item with me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank Councilwoman Lina Gonzalez, Councilman de Andrews and Councilman Rex Richardson. It was wonderful to be able to come forward to our council with strong support of authorship, and I know that there were others that would have authored it as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The original motion set a process and asked the L.A. EDC for Research and Business Survey. This evening we heard Dr. Cooper report back on the highlights of that study and that process, and I'd like to thank the L.A. EDC for their work and study and and truly their deliberation on looking at this from a Long Beach perspective'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And while the comparisons are useful and helpful to our surrounding cities, it has been very helpful to be able to see ourselves as ourselves and how we live, how we work, how we spend our money, where the greatest impacts will be when we take one action or another, and where the greatest impacts will be if we take'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no action. And that's been important to hear. I authored the original item because The Gap. The gap continues to grow between the wealthy and the poor, and we continue to deal with the impacts of a growing class of residents living in poverty.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that that is not something that's new to any of us. It's something that we've all paid attention to. We recognize it is at times easy to look away. But I do know that we are represented by a council that finds it very difficult to look away when the disparity can be so vulgar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we did was we encouraged a very methodical and logical approach to the issue that included the impact on small businesses and nonprofits. And I believe that's what's actually exactly transpired in these last five months through our public roundtable discussions, staff reports and commission meetings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I wanted to really emphasize we've heard this from other speakers, but that the community process truly worked. And the process that the staff engaged in together with the Economic Development Commission truly worked. The Economic Development Commission, I have to say at this point, I want to emphasize how hard they worked and the hundreds of workers as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well, the small business owners and stakeholders that spoke in front of the commission over two hearings and two policy meetings. These were all individuals in their own right, have very, very, very busy lives. But they had committed and continue to commit to this public policy debate because they know they know that it will impact the entire city'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of Long Beach and more than the city of Long Beach. We have workers here that don't live here that sustain families elsewhere. And so that commitment does not. It is not overlooked. It's something that doesn't go unnoticed. While we've all signed up here behind the dias for another full time job, none of you as individuals do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when you do, when you do stand up and contribute to the public process, it's something that I, I deeply value and I'm very grateful for. So I'd like to thank all of you, especially the Economic Development Commission, for the work and all of the members of the community that participated in it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to go back a little bit to the disparity that was highlighted by Dr. Cooper in her report of the study. And as I had said before, it isn't anything that is new to any of us. But sometimes when we hear things just very specifically to Long Beach, I think it strikes us differently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do feel very personally about where we live and and the city we live in. When Mayor Foster first ran, I think many of us remember he talked about Long Beach being a tale of two cities. And at that time, he asked us to consider, collectively consider.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The income and wealth disparity in Long Beach. And that was ten years ago. And I'll submit to you today that it wasn't only Mayor Foster's concern, nor was it just the council's concern. The residents of Long Beach shared that concern, too, and since 2006, we have seen great struggles throughout the world and really our nation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if I just look at Long Beach, we have we have experienced great struggles as a city and as individuals. We saw the greatest economic recession since the Great Depression, and it struck everyone. It didn't strike us all equally, but it did strike everyone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In Long Beach isn't unique to the disparities that Dr. Cooper highlights from the L.A. Economic Development Study. Global inequality is growing. Should that matter to us for this conversation tonight? Absolutely. It is all relative and it's related. And we learned yesterday with a new study that was out that half of the world's wealth now is in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hands of just 1% of the population. And that's significant. Thankfully, that's not the case in Long Beach. But when we look at our local example and we look at how desperately some of our families live, we have to be concerned whether it is as drastic a figure as the global inequity is or it is not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the level of income concentration, the disparity has fluctuated throughout history. That, too, is not new. But what's new is we have an opportunity. We have a collective conscience and an opportunity to correct some things that need to be corrected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when we look at this opportunity to do this and we think about the Long Beach way, and some of us have come into this conversation only on this issue, but many of you have been in a larger conversation in the city of Long Beach that I say goes back a decade.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what that conversation is, is raising the quality of life in the city of Long Beach. And I'm going to look right at Councilmember Tonya Reyes Turanga, who was here on that council at the time. And she can attest that this is not a new conversation for any of us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have incrementally brought forward policy changes and supported initiatives and advocated on behalf of raising the quality of life in Long Beach, not just for the residents of Long Beach, but for the good men and women who help us live our lives the way we do, the way we would like to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so one major example of that, and there are so many other examples that attest to that is Measure N, which was the living wage ordinance that we passed, that the voters passed. Council put it on the ballot and the voters passed that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that was to raise the income, the wage for hotel workers in the city of Long Beach. And that was significant. And at that time, we had heard that there were fears by business owners that we may end up shuttering hotel rooms, we may end up seeing great losses to our hotel industry.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So this is something that the council needs to consider $15 an hour because 13 is not enough. 1250 is not enough. 1250 and five years certainly is not enough. We need paid sick days. We need citywide enforcement of these changes.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'A lot of students that we work with actually share that. They're in the process of looking for work now as they're in high school. So the reality is, is not at an age when at a certain age, when people need to work or an age above 25, it starts at a young age since even their junior high'",

        "'speaker_12': 'And for those students that have to now depend on themselves and work with this decision of exempting the youth, you're also hurting those students to have a better quality of life and to be able to sustain themselves. So as you make your decision, you need to see the students holistically and the diversity of our youth that they'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, everybody. Honorable Mayor Garcia City Council. My name is Alex Montana. Says I live in the First District and I work for the Filipino Migrants Center. I support raising the minimum wage, the Long Beach Way, which is $15 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'City led wage enforcement, more paid sick days and no exemptions. I support this not just for me, but for the hundreds of Westside Long Beach residents that my organization and our volunteers have talked to in the last six months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've been asking community residents what they think about raising and enforcing the minimum wage, and an overwhelming majority are saying the same thing. We need $15 an hour now and we need city led wage enforcement now. In November, the Filipino migrant center surveyed 110 West Side Long Beach residents in the seventh District about this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of them were Filipino, Latino and other folks of color. 98% of the folks who answered the survey said they support raising the wage to $15 an hour. 62% said they have experienced wage theft personally. 41% say that they know somebody who has experienced wage theft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And 100% of them said they want a Long Beach law that really protects workers from wage theft. And the truth is, wage theft is rampant here in Long Beach. It's not just with these big corporations. We're seeing it a lot also even in small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have at the Filipino Migrant Center, we've received dozens of Filipino workers and a lot of them work in Long Beach. A lot of them have experienced wage theft at small resident care, small caregiving industries and also small restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's not just big companies, but small companies as well. And when it comes to wage theft, we don't need just one one person in the city Long Beach office. We need a real office that is really enforcing wage enforcement here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need strong wage enforcement here. And of course, we can't have these exemptions. That just leaves room that just makes it harder to enforce and also leaves loopholes. And so that's why we really need to stay strong on $15 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to stay strong on city led wage enforcement. We need to stay strong on more paid sick days. And we need to stay strong.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In saying that we will.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'A long time ago, we discussed this issue and I think we all agreed that it was important to increase the minimum wage. We didn't know what that would be, but we saw through all the discussions and all the conversations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We reached kind of a level that we would support $13 an hour by 2019 with the caveat of two things We want a youth wage in there, and we wanted the concept of total earnings. You heard that discussed tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not a tip. Credit has nothing to do with tip credit. It's total earnings is the amount of money that any employee, not just restaurants employees but any employee makes in a pay period. So what I'm asking for you tonight to consider as a friendly amendment to any motion that's made tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is a youth.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wage up to 21. And for you to ask the city attorney to come back prior to the first reading and whenever that's in mid-February or late February, to have him come back and say, here is my legal opinion on total earnings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Give him time to come back with that, because I think you're going to find that the Long Beach Way includes restaurants that were built and raised here in Long Beach. I'm not talking national chains like KFC or El Pollo Loco or Subway or McDonald's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm talking on the backs of people who started their restaurants here in Long Beach. They raise their kids in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They helped out the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nonprofits in Long Beach by supporting them. I'm talking about restaurants like Georges and Trainee's in the eighth. I'm talking like La Luna and the Six. I'm talking like E.J. Malloy's in the fourth and other parts in other council districts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm talking boathouse. I'm talking talent. Sooner or later st on second. I'm talking about people that you all know and love and spend a lot of time with. When you have the ability to go out there and have dinner on the weekends, you frequent their restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're asking for you to support them with a concept of total earnings and a youth wage. It's not for those that work at KFC and make a minimum wage of $10 an hour and no other earnings. We all get that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We all understand that. But we're asking for you do is to consider the full service restaurants that start here in Long Beach and continue to thrive here. Thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Dan Fleming. I'm president of the Economic Roundtable. We prepared this report. Long Beach Rising, a city that works for everyone. To analyze the effects of a $15 an hour minimum wage. Our bottom line assessment is that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That the minimum wage will not harm employment in Long Beach and that it will meet urgent needs of workers who are employed here. Most employers would like to do right by their workers so that they can afford to pay for basic necessities, a higher minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Enables all employers to solve this problem together, rather than leaving it to individual employers to risks to take the risks of solving it alone. Long Beach's economy is resilient and the sectors that have high concentrations of low wage workers, including restaurants and retail.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the port of the Port of Long Beach is an important source of economic strength and depth for the city's economy. The wage increase will create a stimulus that will offset any effects as service industries adjust to putting more money into payroll and paying higher wages.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In response to your question, Councilwoman Gonzalez, our report analyzes the flow of workers at different wage levels across the city line. And we estimate that 16,769 residents of Long Beach will benefit from a $15 an hour minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One third of the wage and total wage increase will go to residents of Long Beach. Businesses will grow and new businesses will start up in underinvested neighborhoods of the city that need these services. We estimate that the stimulus effect will create over 3000 jobs with a thousand of them in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And probably most importantly, we estimate that. Nearly 15,000 people, including nearly 6000 children, will be lifted out of poverty by a $15 an hour minimum wage and that the poverty rate among workers will be cut close to in half.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in summary, we believe that the evidence enables the city to go into a wage increase with its eyes open and with tools for watching effects over the five years that an increase in falls to the benefit of folks who work here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor. Councilman. My name is Craig Hoffman. And I own five restaurants in four districts in the city of Long Beach. My family's been in the restaurant business in Long Beach for over 60 years. As Mike Burchett said presented earlier, I think that having some sort of earnings exemption would be very important to full service restaurants'",
        "'speaker_5': 'if we don't do something like that. I'm very concerned about the over 500 people I employ in the city that could be affected. Unfortunately, Long Beach is not just an island. We have cities surrounding us like Signal Hill and Cerritos and Lakewood and Los Alamitos, which are going to have these same provisions of minimum wage, and we're'",
        "'speaker_5': 'going to have higher prices on our menus. And and I see I see customers going to the neighboring cities. And I think it's going to affect our sales and it's going to affect our employment. And I think we need to to start slowly.'",
        "'speaker_5': '$13 with the earnings exemption is something reasonable and not something that's really going to hurt the restaurant so badly. I mean, I have one restaurant that's closed because of a fire and I'm working diligently to rebuild it. But there's some question in my mind whether I should reopen it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's going to depend a lot on what the council does. We have to have reasonable wages and we have to have an ability to have full service restaurants in Long Beach and not just focus the minimum wage on the fast food industry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's my comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Renata Yanna, and I'm a lead researcher at the UCLA Labor Center Study, where we surveyed over 550 young workers in the retail and restaurant industries in Los Angeles County, including young people from here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We know that many of these young workers. There's. Let me start over. Sorry. There's a myth that young people work for pocket change and have used that as an excuse to provide low wages. Yet our study finds that 48% of the young workers actually gave to their families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In fact, less than 1% spend their earnings solely on recreation or leisure activities. Thus, we know that young workers need it. In fact, almost three quarters said that they would like to work more hours. Almost half of those that work within the retail and restaurant industries are young people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These industries already pay low wages. However, they also provide young workers with much needed income that supports families and educational careers. Policymakers and elected officials muster away from initiatives that would create a distinct wage status for younger workers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Research in history shows that such wage divisions are economically foolish, political unsound, legally unquestionable and socially unjust. Therefore, our research suggests that the City of Long Beach should not pass an exemption for workers under 21. No worker, younger or older, should be exempt for a minimum wage increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mr. Garcia. And Councilman, my name is Hillary Habib and I'm a Labor and employment attorney with the law firm of Sheppard and Bowen. And tonight I'm here on behalf of the Coalition of Full Service Restaurants located in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'd like to discuss the total earnings exemption approach, which many people have discussed this evening. If the city is inclined to adopt a local minimum wage, it should also adopt the total earnings exemption. Under this approach, the new minimum wage would apply to all people who are not exempt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now it's common for labor laws to have these sort of exemptions, including state overtime, meal period, rest period and paid sick leave laws. And it makes sense for exempt employees who already receive taxable earnings at or above a minimum level to for this to apply to in fact, the IRS and Franchise Tax Board treat these sums as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'taxable earnings from a job and insist that they be recognized as part of the gross income. Also, the common sense supports this approach. For example, if an employee earns 1250 an hour from his or her work, it does not matter where those taxable earnings are derived from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll be at peace rate, earnings, tip salary or other taxable amounts, the earnings of the employees to save or spend as the employee chooses. Now we've heard a lot about the potential limitations on this exemption, but as the city attorney said, there is no binding or persuasive authority on point saying that this exemption is impermissible for a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city councilman impossible to enact. And now critics of the exemption mistakenly rely on inapplicable case law. Regarding tip credits. As Mike Richardson said, this is not a tip credit, this is an exemption. It's completely different. And and so that is completely debunked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Further, the city attorney mentioned the Legislative Council Bureau's opinion letter, and again, that is completely inapplicable because that only applies to tip credits. It did not address a proposal for a specific carve out or exemption for any employee of any employer, not just tipped employees employed by restaurants whose taxable earnings exceed a specified amount.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the letter, in fact, conceded that there is an uncertainty and an absence of directly controlling law on this issue. And finally, the attorney who proposed this total earnings exemption is a partner of my law firm, and he's written one of the most widely used wage and hour books in the country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'His book has been used by officials in the labor commission in the U.S. Department of Labor, and he was appointed by the Industrial Welfare Committee as a member of several minimum wage boards. And so he's obviously qualified to give an opinion on this exemption.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we urge you to insert a total innings exemption, earnings exemption as part of any minimum wage ordinance. It's the single most important issue, as you've heard tonight, for the restaurants of Long Beach. And we further asked the city attorney to to review the legality of this prior to a first reading.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Saba Waheed, and I am the research director at the UCLA Labor Center. I have conducted extensive research or extensive research on young people in the county. Our research shows that young people are a core part of the economy, making up one quarter of the workforce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the soaring cost of living affects young people just as much as they do other workers. Young people face higher education costs than any generation before them, and they're also earning a lot less. With almost one in three young workers as a head of household and 18% to our parents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want to caution against framing a person's early job as some kind of hobby or rite of passage. Young people should not be seen as cheap and temporary labor. In fact, scholars have found that these early jobs have life have lasting effects on their lifetime earnings and social well-being.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We cannot afford to fall into the clichd trap that young workers should work for less to gain experience. Let's show the young workers of Long Beach that their work matters, that their work is real work, and that they will be fairly compensated.'",

My name is John Kabateck, and I am here tonight representing the California Restaurant Association and an industry comprised of more than 1000 restaurants and food service operators here in Long Beach. Kyra has proudly worked with the Coalition of Business Associations on this local minimum wage issue these past several months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We appreciate the hard work of the commission these past year and also your efforts on the council to determine a reasonable minimum wage policy. That will be a sterling example, we think, for cities across the Golden State, but also across the nation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As the commission's study itself shows, a higher minimum wage in Long Beach on its own would absolutely result in negative impacts on our small businesses and jobs. However, by including the right mitigating provisions, along with a higher minimum wage, you have a golden opportunity here to ensure that such an increase is targeted to those who will benefit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from it the most, while allowing small businesses an opportunity to stay in business and keep creating jobs. To that end, Kerry is willing to consider a minimum wage increase in Long Beach to $12.50 an hour, phased in gradually over five years, provided it is coupled with the following provisions to support and protect our local businesses and jobs'",
        "'speaker_3': '. An additional one year extension for businesses with 25 or fewer employees, which will allow the smallest of small businesses to adequately adjust and prepare a youth wage of $10 an hour for employees under 21 years old. Giving more small businesses the opportunity to hire more young people and give them the promise of a rewarding career right here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in Long Beach, and allow these people to continue to live and work and enjoy being here in Long Beach. And finally, as you've heard before, the inclusion of total earnings, the ability for employers to consider exempting from the increase those employees earning more than the new minimum wage in wages, tips, commissions.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Even though I'm only 18, I am not a typical teenager who makes money to buy personal needs. Few of the teenagers who do work in fast food do it just for just extra cash. Like most people I know, I took out Carls Junior because.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Which I'm going to be starting in a couple of weeks, and I'm very excited, shall I say. But this will be not enough for me to just pay half rent and for me to be paying for my textbooks and for my personal hobbies and for my personal needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I just turned 18 and I'm barely finding out how much responsibility it is to really be here in the real world and having to actually take care of yourself. And I personally believe $10 is not enough.'",

So usually we're here advocating for a policy for the community members. But it's nice to be here for a change to represent and speak on behalf of the nonprofit community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there you go. So on behalf of our nonprofit organization that I work for, Building of the Community's Long Beach, located here in District one, we are speaking tonight and strong support for raising the wage to 15 an hour soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as we take a stand and pass a policy, the Long Beach Way where we asked for 15 and our strong enforcement, no exemptions and we're not leaving our hardworking employees of both small businesses and nonprofits or young workers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's create an equitable policy that fits lifts all of Long Beach up building healthy communities. Long Beach, as you may have heard, conducted a survey of nonprofit leaders and community members asking the specific question Do you support an increase of the minimum wage?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And a supermajority? Of those, 80 respondents were in favor of raising the minimum wage without exceptions, with no exceptions. And that included 75% of respondents who are on building of the community's Long Beach organizational partners.

        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor. City Council, Lady Gonzales, all the others. I come to speak to you on this issue because I do support the $15 with no exemptions. And I think there should be health care time for so people can get off and stay well and come back and not infect other people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I was really struck tonight by the fact that you had these are awards around Martin Luther King, because when I was 21 years old, I did personal security for him when he came to our campus and he was under death threats.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that does that this issue because eight years later, he was killed in Memphis when he was there fighting for workers to try and get decent wages and have dignity in their lives and have a way to live.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's what your job is now, is to do that to the people of Long Beach. And $15 an hour is not an unfair high amount of money. It's not even as much as Social Security payments are from four workers who worked most of their life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're not talking about people getting rich, you know, offer largess provided by their employers. No, we're talking about they create that wealth that the employer has through their work. The employer doesn't do it. The employees create the wealth and they deserve to have enough to live with dignity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's why I'm here to speak for this as an as a person from the first District. So thank you very much. Just do the right thing tonight. Move forward and ahead. Look, it is as Martin Luther King would do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let's have some justice here and let's have some dignity for the working people of Long Beach. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Well, I didn't know how difficult it was to be in your positions that I was as being a commissioner of economic development. But I'm not here as that. I'm here as a entrepreneur, as a business person, and as a resident of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I try to figure out what I was going to say. So I was at the end of line because of trying to figure out what can I say if you haven't heard already a thousand times? I think I can actually can come up with something.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a little bit about myself. I'm an entrepreneur. I've been an entrepreneur.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Since.'",
        "'speaker_5': '1993 when I quit my perfectly good job at Johnson and Johnson. And I remember being so poor after two and a half years that I had a three day notice and quit on my door. And then, of course, I asked my father for money, which is the lowest common denominator.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know what you say in the first place. And he told me, Son, get a real job. So that's what entrepreneurship really is. To many people, it's a risk. To entrepreneurs is something that you strive to do, is something you think about maybe all your life and oftentimes you find out the challenges of being an entrepreneur are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'so you're so naive going into the process. 85% of businesses and entrepreneurs fail in the first year, and these are probably statistics you already heard, but they don't believe that they're going to fail. They believe that they can succeed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They sign their first lease, oftentimes putting them in $150,000 in debt. They've maxed out every single credit card that they possibly could have. And usually the average entrepreneur, a business owner, is making about $67,000 a year. That's what they make.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Plus they don't get vacations. I had frankly, I haven't had a vacation in four years. And I've been in business for almost 20 years. I myself haven't had a vacation. I don't have, you know, worker's comp. I don't qualify for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't have disability. I don't get paid time off. And I work probably 80 hours a week, which my wife oftentimes complains about because she she I actually work for her. So I'm here really to talk about someone who's not here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And those individuals are unemployed. I my company has probably hired over the last eight years over 100 individuals who are unemployed, using programs and money available from the Workforce Investment Board, now known as we owe it. It's subsidized employment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are individuals who are unemployed, who had absolutely no skills. Homeless, vets, welfare to work. Individuals that have been employed. Some unemployed for sometimes four years. And what I'm here to ask you to do is consider not an exemption, but a business incentive for businesses that are willing to hire the demographics that we owe covers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's a pretty wide reach. So if that's something that the council would be interested in doing, I think that would be an incentive for businesses to bring the most challenged, hire individuals into our workforce. And I hope that's something that you will look at and consider reasonably.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'the record. Whereas a large percentage of Long Beach workers are in poverty level wages, living in overcrowded housing, pay over half of their income for rent and qualify for food stamps. These conditions exist because employers do not comply with labor and tax laws and pay workers under the table.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Vulnerable to wage.'",

Earlier, she said that data is always good. The COBR representative from the COBR representative also said that we should do a policy that's data driven.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's important as a researcher to understand the difference between good data and bad data.

        "'speaker_5': 'This is the only way to do it, is lifting their wages and helping them to increase and grow. So I mean, I hopefully you guys make the right decision and open your hearts to everybody. I understand it's a it's a struggle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a it's a personal and it's a it's a big decision that you guys have in front of you guys. But I hope you guys make the right decision. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm also I see there's four people left on the speakers list. If there's if there's anyone else. And I'd be a good time to ask them. And I probably cut it off pretty soon here. So. Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good to you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Very good to clear as the address. Before I give you my view of what needs to be done, let me tell you, let me run down my work history, my life's experiences, and those that I've run into that helped shape the opinion that I will in about 2 minutes, in part.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I started selling Wallace Brown gift cards, Christmas cards and greeting cards door to door when I was in middle school. Then went and migrated into selling and cutting lawns. Then I got a paper out working for the paper that was part of the chain that was originally the owner of the Press Telegram.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then I started caddying and I did that on, on weekends and in summers, and that's what I got introduced into politics. I used to caddie for Ray Place, who was chair of the Republican National Committee for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In during summer college times, I worked in resort hotels up in New England. That's where I met William Casey and was kind of the areas for him for a couple of years. During or during the summer. While in college.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I work I think I references a couple of weeks ago for School for Food Corporation, one of their restaurants. I'd get up at 5:00 in the morning, take the elevator down out of the dorm, often writing at the same time that he that's for four years there and ten years in Boston to find the six man defense'",
        "'speaker_5': '. When I got out of college, Stover's made me a job or a job offer, which I took because Roy Ash and Tex Thornton and purchased them and I knew I could migrate into other areas. And one of the things that I've learned, first of all, I have a very high respect for anybody that works in a restaurant'",
        "'speaker_5': ', and that's not because I work there. All right. Is a given job pays only X amount of dollars, period. If you're not making enough money in the vocation you're in. Go out and get retrained. Don't wait for somebody else to come around and get a movement going because that movement will not sustain you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just like in this case, I don't think people have mentioned the fact that within the next year, these people up here are going to be hitting the owners and everybody here with ballot measures for tax increases, period, to build a new to try to build and a new city hall period.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what you've got to do is go out and figure what you want to do and improve your skill levels. Sufficient enough to make the type of purchases you want to do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay. So hello. My name is Rochat and I am a resident of the seventh district. Although I'm right across the street from the first district. Is that really interesting cusp? So what brings us here today is a very important and momentous day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think so myself and I wasn't going to say anything. I think you've heard plenty, but I think that it begs a few minutes to hear a couple of insights that I got as an organizer, as an immigrant, as a resident of this city, and then also just as a human being.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this a missed opportunity on January 19th, right? A day after we celebrate the life, the legacy, the work of Dr. Martin Luther King. We are gathered here today for actually exactly the same thing that he died for in Memphis with sanitation workers asking to raise the minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so what you saw earlier here today was, I would say about 100 workers being able to tell their stories to come to you and let you know why it is precisely that they need to raise this wage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as an organizer, I was extremely, extremely happy, proud and quite humbly honored to hear every single one of their stories of struggle, of toil. For them to be here today, they're not here right now because they're probably going home to sleep.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a resident. I'm also extremely happy because hundreds of workers have continued this fight and have continued to come out day in and day out on all the different hearings that we have had to let, you know their very impressive perspective of what it means to be a day to day worker and why it is important for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'them to get a raise. Now as an immigrant. As an immigrant to this great nation, I would say. Into the city. I have also seen how cities have been able to contribute and help workers and help students and help people really become better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't believe in the bootstrap mentality. Because I have heard a couple of different immigrant stories. I want to tell you a little bit about how that doesn't work for a lot of the folks who have actually been here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of the folks who have been here don't have the same opportunities or access to the same opportunities that some of the folks here have had in the past. So that immigrant that one dynamic immigrant experience doesn't happen because it didn't happen to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That didn't happen to me. And so as an immigrant to this country and to this city, we see that every individual has a different perspective. So do the workers. So today you heard countless stories about why it's imperative to raise the wage to 15, because that is what they deserve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they deserve wage enforcement because they live through wage theft every single day. So they need that to survive and they need those sick pay days also to survive. So thank you and make the right choice. You know what to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Vince BASTIANICH. My family's been operating businesses on the west side for nearly 70 years. With all due respect, Councilwoman Lowenthal, I think your cause is noble, but I think it's misguided and misinformed. The minimum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The minimum wage is never eliminated. Poverty. It won't close the wage gap and never has. It would be really a terrible thing for the city. You know, the one of the first minimum wage laws was the 1939 Bacon Davis Act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the purpose of that law was to. Protect. The jobs of white union workers in New York from black Southern workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Continue, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These these wage increases will will do nothing for these workers, because what will happen is prices will go up. Across the board and these same workers who are making minimum now, they just will not get ahead. They'll be in the same position they are now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Five years from now. Ten years from now. I've been in this business a long time and I've seen it. You know, my minimum wage workers and I do have some they can never get ahead unless they increase their skills.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Unless they. You know, try to find another job that's better suited to them. They can't get ahead. Parts of Long Beach now, I've been told, have unemployment rate as high as 19%. And I believe it's only going to get worse if we try raising the minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the better route is to help businesses create more jobs with more jobs, more businesses competing for labor. Wages will go up organically and those those workers will get ahead that way. I think that's a better option.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next, me complete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name's Murray de Soto. I've stood in front of you many times before representing the union and are what we do. I'm a hotel worker, and I actually wasn't going to speak today, but I heard one of the gentleman here that is a business owner of Long Beach said that he hasn't heard a tipped worker speak'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So I will speak on behalf of all of the tipped workers in Long Beach and all of my friends and family members that are tipped employees in Long Beach. I happen to work for a union hotel and I happened to make $15 an hour and I happened to be tipped.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My hotel doesn't seem to be going down any time soon. It has taken me out of poverty. The gentleman before me said $15 an hour will not take anybody out of poverty. Yes, it will. Well, I'm 23 years old and I am a homeowner in the ninth District and I am proud.'",
        "'speaker_1': '23. Being 23, if I was working minimum wage, that means I wouldn't be making what my husband is making because he's 28. How is that fair? How is it fair that because I am not 25, I'm not making that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What if I was a mother? What if I was a single mother? I am standing behalf of all those tipped workers, including my tip into my pay is wage theft. That is wage theft. The tip that I get from doing a service is that it's from the guest that was happy with my service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sometimes you could give the best service possible and people won't tip you. Do you get stiffed all the time and we still have to pay taxes on that? I've seen my coworkers have negative checks because people don't tip them or because of the taxes that they get on top of their pay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not fair. And again, I stand for all of the tipped workers here in Long Beach, $15 an hour, no exemptions, $15 an hour, no exemptions for the youth, because that is age discrimination. If we don't discriminate for the old, we don't discriminate for the youth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why are we discriminating? It's just like racial discrimination. It is another form of discrimination. It is not okay. And I am a tipped employee and I stand for all of the tipped employees again. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Thank you, sir. Okay. Hey, hold on a second, guys. But we know we serve 1/2 word. Well, I'm asking everyone to have it get the same amount of respect when they speak. So please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Somebody liked my short. I'm a small business owner in Long Beach. My name is George Subang. I have a restaurant, have 18 employees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm wondering how many of you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People think that a 60% wage increase will enable any business in Long Beach or anywhere in the world to survive? This is what you're talking about, a few dollars an hour. This is a 60% wage increase over what it was when it was $9 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the minimum wage goes up a dollar in my restaurant, it costs me $500 a week in payroll. The minimum wage has gone up $2. So it's cost me now $1,000 a week in payroll. If it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Goes to $15.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An hour, my current payroll is $250,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If it goes to $15 an hour, my payroll will be $400,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's $150,000 increase. I don't make that kind of money in the restaurant. We're lucky to make 10%. Yet all of you people think it's really easy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To do a 60% wage increase. It's ludicrous. So what am I doing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I've got a $500 wage increase last year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I raised my prices to get $500 more at a $500 wage increase this year. I raised my prices again. I will raise my prices every time the minimum wage goes up. And by the time it gets to $15, you people that still have jobs will be paying $16 for a hamburger.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You need to realize this is pure inflation. Nobody is going to gain from this minimum wage increase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's ludicrous to think that any small.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Business can sustain.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A 60% wage increase when we fight to make 10% gross margin. It's ludicrous.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't I don't know what else to say. I'm I just can't believe that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Anybody in this room thinks that any business can sustain that kind of a wage increase. And if you guys vote for this $15 an hour wage increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You will, in fact, be hurting the people that you think you're helping because of the people that are still have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Jobs will be paying $16 for a hamburger. They will not have gained a nickel. Let me give you one more fact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In 1950, the minimum wage was $0.75 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In today's dollars, that was $7.01 in buying power. The federal minimum wage today is seven and a quarter an hour.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That means in 65.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Years, the buying power of the minimum wage has increased. Workers pay by $0.24. You guys need to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Realize that the minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is pure inflation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. That that closes down our our speakers list. So a few things and we're going to take this back to the council for for deliberation. I want to obviously just start by thanking everyone that came in and spoke tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A an amendment from this over to Vice Mayor Lowenthal, who's the author of the original motion. But I wanted to. Without obviously repeating a lot of what I've been saying over the last few weeks, I want to just say a few.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I want to start off by obviously thanking all of the workers that have come out and advocated for their families and themselves, the business owners. And I want to also just say that there's been sometimes you hear things about business owners, and I know a lot of these guys out here, whether it's Lisa or Jimmy'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or Mike and you guys are good guys. I get that. Thank you for for having great businesses in the city and for your investments. And so I know that most of you guys aren't coming to this thing because you don't care about your employees, because I know you guys care about them very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to I want to thank the the the the Fed and the Raise the Wage Coalition, who have been very active in leading this effort on on the worker side as well as the Council of Business Association groups.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the deal Bay, the Basement Sales Improvement Association, the Anaheim Business Group, all the different groups and business groups that were a part of that, including the chamber. Thank you, guys, for for your advocacy. I want to thank mostly one of the staff because I know that for a lot of us, a lot of us have been'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to these hearings. I've been to many some people up here, including Councilman Mango and Councilmember Turanga or members of the Council Committee. So they've been to a few and additional to everybody else up here. But the staff has been, I think, a complete kind of all star team since day one on the city side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know you guys don't see a lot of their work, but they've been working very hard to answer questions from the council, to answer questions from the community, from business owners, from from workers. And so I just want to thank the staff for all your hard work in this process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been it's been tough. I also want to particularly thank the Economic Development Commission and their their work. Again, I was counting I think they did. They hosted two hearings and two separate meetings just on this issue. And so if you guys thought tonight was a lot, which it was, I think they had four of those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that was that's a lot of work and a lot of input. And obviously they they forwarded on some recommendations tonight. And so I just want to thank them. And so I think all that's important to to be said as we move forward in this in this conversation, I'm going to on to this over to to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor Lowenthal. I know I have a long speakers list, folks with different ideas, I'm sure, and input, which is great. So let's be respectful to the process, please, and let's hear what people what people have to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyone's had a chance to weigh in at this point, with the exception of the nine members of the council. So let's let's give them their shot now. So let's turn this over to Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Actually, if you can just give me a minute. I'm just pulling up something. Perhaps if someone has a question, I would appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. What I'm going to do is turn this over to Councilman Mongo, just to do an announcement from Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Price had to leave suddenly when notified that fire personnel were with her children as her husband was rushed to the hospital. Mark is currently in stable condition in the E.R., and she does not know if she'll be able to return.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But she's 5 minutes away. Should he get to a point where she can return so she apologizes. He is in our thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, absolutely. I think our whole family's is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In our thoughts. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great advice for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm glad you made that announcement. I know several of you were concerned. And if you can just keep her and her family in our thoughts. I would appreciate it. So I want to thank everyone for the robust conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I lost count how many speakers came forward. But certainly everyone that came forward has a valid and and very important. Message to share with us. And it's they're more than just opinions. And this council has listened and does listen and is very grateful for all of your input and and you're very passionate about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we heard different levels of passion. I do want to take us back to the first speaker, not because she was the most impactful or powerful, but something about her testimony. It reminded me quite a bit of the early work I did in domestic violence and how economic independence can be so liberating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we often think of liberty as sometimes just an option to have something more. Greater wealth, perhaps. But I worked in a field and industry where liberty meant really liberty from. From tyranny in your own household. Liberty from the oppressiveness that that being trapped because of economic reasons can provide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so she she reminds me that liberty, dignity and opportunity, that a living wage or raising the minimum wage can provide is something that cannot be overlooked there. And it isn't just my personal, philosophical orientation to the issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is backed by numerous studies. And so I think when when we hear those of us who talk about the fundamental human reasons why we should do something, there's there's sometimes an assumption that it's not backed by data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if there's ever a doubt that anything that I have worked on on this council in the last decade has not been backed by data. I implore you to reconsider that thought and do your research, because that has never been the case.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I may come to the dias and speak in a very impassioned way and perhaps leave out some of the very academic research that our staff has done or that I have done. But let there never be a doubt that these thoughts and proposals are not well researched.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We talk about how much work and workers do, and we know that worker productivity has gone up much more than wages. That, too, is backed by data. I think our last speaker, who is a highly reputable restaurant owner in our community and has done quite a bit in employing people in our city, addressed that minimum wage was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just mere inflation and and. It's an opinion and it's a point of view, and I respect that. But I will share with you, backed by research and data, that worker productivity has gone up much faster than wages. Workers are already much more productive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what we have is the Center for Economic Policy and Research in a 2012 issue brief that reported, if you use the 1968 minimum wage as a benchmark federal. Minimum wage as a benchmark. And I'm only citing this because it's sort of that primacy and recency theory.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You remember the first thing you heard and you remember the last thing you heard in the last. The last speaker was quite compelling in his point of view that minimum wage was just an inflation. So I'll point to a study that states that if you look at the 1968 federal minimum wage as a benchmark, if minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'grew at the same rate as worker productivity, it would have reached $21.72 per hour by 2012. So I think it's a little bit more than a gift. It's a lot more than a gift. It's it is paying someone the worth of the work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also when everything else goes up in price, but the minimum wage does not. And we know that everything else has gone up in price when the minimum wage has not. Then we have to ask ourselves the question what type of city and what type of living environment do we expect our residents and our workers to live'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in? So when we take it back to what the L.A. EDC report showed us, we know that in Long Beach, 46.4% of our households have $50,000 or less in household income. And that's not to speak to the number of individuals that live in that household.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But just if we look at that, we know that 21.1% of individuals live below the federal poverty level. And I'm not sure if we're all familiar with the federal what the federal poverty level is. Our presenter mentioned that it was low and she said it was very low and emphasized it a couple of times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is very low. The 2015 poverty level for a household of one person is $11,770. Tuition to a good school costs more than that. And we talk about a society of opportunities for two people. It's $15,930. For three, it's $20,090.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you add about 4 to $5000 per person that you add to our household. It is extremely low. So when we say that someone is 150% above poverty level or 200% above poverty level, those are not huge amounts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you add in Long Beach, those of us who are up to 150% poverty level and those of us who are up to 200% still very low. That brings us to 42.9% of our city. Almost 50% of our city live in conditions on incomes that I don't think a lot of us think about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is quite an out of sight, out of mind situation. It's an incredible figure. But people make do and they figure it out at such low income levels. Most of the earnings we know we also saw this in the study.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It goes to housing, it goes to food, it goes to transportation. There are very basic things. There are no luxuries involved at such low levels. And by luxuries, I'm they're not luxuries. I just mean just any form of recreation which we all know contributes to well-being.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We heard people talk about not knowing when the last time they took a holiday. I don't think they mean a holiday overseas. I just think they mean a day off from work. That's a holiday. And that's that's important for us to keep in mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not my frame of reference necessarily, but it is someone else's experience and what it means to be in that person's shoes. And we know that that's not one person. That's nearly half of our city. That's a lot of people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We heard from our teenagers in the audience and young adults about the opportunity to study. And to improve their opportunities to study. That is what this nation was built on. It was built on opportunities. And we have seen our society lose touch with with the with really what this country was founded on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that really is an opportunity to improve ourselves. How does a child do that when she has to help support her household, when she is contributing to supporting a household? We've always talked about kids only job being a student.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Be a student, do your studies. That is what a child's profession is. We've heard from many children tonight that and I, I know you're young adults, but you are children. We have heard from many children that they contribute to their household income.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So how do you study and improve yourself when that is part of what your obligation is? And I know you do it willingly and gladly because that's what we do. We support our families. But even as parents, that must be crushing for your parents to know that they need your help to support the family.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So raising wages, when combined with the opportunity to save, can comprise a family's total opportunity. That's what this conversations about. It's not about a dollar more an hour or $2 more an hour. It is. What does that mean to a family?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A family's total opportunity. And there is some significance to that when we consider that to secure a standard of living that is dignified. And we heard a lot about living with dignity. But what do we mean by that when you're not able to secure a standard of living that's dignified?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't have our entire population participating in what we all call as a quality of life. That is what all of us here are elected to do is to improve our residents quality of life. So doing. So raising wages combined with the opportunity to save.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It contributes to both short and long term financial security. And I take us back to our first speaker. It is because of the inability to have financial security that she and others, many, many others find themselves in very dangerous situations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we do so, when we raise wages combined with the opportunity to save, we can contribute to the overall well-being that affords people a feeling of agency. And by agency I mean the ability to act. We don't have the ability to act or act or on our own will or volition when we don't have that many choices'",
        "'speaker_2': ', when we don't have that many economic choices. And so it does afford people that feeling of agency. And it's more than a feeling. It is a reality that is the society we live in. You talked about Mayor Foster talking about a tale of two cities that contributes to that divide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those of us who can act and those of us who cannot act really is is that division is created by that income and wealth inequity. And the accumulation of wealth while we're talking about income right now. But over time, if we are able to have people on the path where they can participate in that, it grants us'",
        "'speaker_2': 'more options and it really eliminates the restrictions on how one can live one's life. So the notion that raising the minimum wage would not lift people out of poverty. It is not my opinion that it is not true.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is a fact that that is not true. In fact, one way to look at it, if you don't act, if we as a council don't act on some reasonable policy. One way to look at it is that low minimum wage laws are a form of government subsidies to low wage businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's exactly what it is. Someone is subsidizing it. And so by not acting, that's what we're doing. What do working people do if they don't have enough to eat or if they need to go to hospital or if they need housing, that's better than where they are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What do they do? They turn to the government for public benefits. That is that cycle that we contribute to when we don't act and do the right thing. And so that subsidy is something that we need to actually reverse and turn into an empowerment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Subsidies don't feel like an empowerment. How does one gain an agency to act when you are on subsidy? But if you are earning your wage and you are earning a living wage and an improved minimum wage, that's that's an opportunity that subsidies can never provide psychologically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can never provide physically in our households stability. And so those are some of the fundamental reasons that bring me here. After ten years of having worked on public policy in this city and after having incrementally with our council, laid down policies that lead us down this path.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is not something that is completely new for this city or the city council. It is really a next step in what we have been working toward all along to improve the quality of life for people in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Take the testimony that we've heard today and we have heard many times about the Long Beach way. And I know there are different opinions about what the Long Beach way is, but something that I will always hold very near and dear to me through my experience here is when Long Beach does do something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would say Mayor Garcia and I would say as goes Long Beach, so does the state of California. We have seen many, many ways that the state has followed Long Beach's path because it has been the right path not only for our city but for the entire state.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't doubt that this will be another example of that, because we it is well thought out. It has been well researched, and we have done our academic literature review as well as our practical data review and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But when you pair that up with a compelling calling to do the right thing, then it is the right thing. It isn't just a point of view. So what I'd like to do at this time, Mr. Mayor. Is I would like to make possibly two, three motions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would. Seek the city attorney's counsel on if they are if they merit splitting them up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two or three motions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Two. Sorry, I meant to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What you think those are two or three relevant. You met.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Two? I meant to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One or two. If the city attorney says it should be combined, then it would be one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'May remember city council. It is possible to divide the question here. If the if the motion is. There's three different items here on the council, and I'm not sure where the council vice mayor is going. But if there's direction to prepare an ordinance and you have certain items that you would like to be voted on second or'",
        "'speaker_10': ', you know, separately to add to that ordinance, you could divide the question the motion of divide. The question requires a second. It is not debatable if there is no objection to dividing the question. Then you could move forward with two separate motions or multiple motions to divide the question.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If there is objection, then there would be a vote on dividing the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Basically it sounds like you can you can divide the question due to motions. If one of the motions is in the spirit of one of the three that's been put forward within the agenda, and with that, if there is no objection to that, then you can move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there is objection without actually voting divided the question. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's correct. The the first motion would be the subject of motion. And then the additional if there's additional motions on dividing the question, then they would need to stand alone. So if you had a motion, for example, that would propose a minimum wage and then that would pass, the second motion of the question that's divided would be'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with the council like to add a particular something to that, an exemption or something else that would be substantive that they could you could move forward with that or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I believe. I understand. So do your colleagues. I would like to make a motion. To approve the recommendations of the Economic Development Commission with a wage schedule of. January 1st, 2017. The wage to $10.50. On January 1st, 2018, an increase to $12.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On January 1st, 2019, an increase to $13. That's exactly as the commission has recommended. Small businesses and nonprofits with 25 or fewer employees have an additional year to implement the schedule, and first increase for them would be in January one, 2018 to $10.50 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This new policy would also include city departments on the same schedule. A strong wage enforcement that is managed by the city and includes private right of action for workers. Mandatory posting. Anti retaliation clause. Revocation power for the city and a fine program for the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In early 2019, launch a second study with the L.A. Economic Development. Corporation to study the minimum wage impacts on employment, sales tax and overall impact on economy that will be presented to the Long Beach City Council at a special hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And colleagues, I'd like to note that this comes from all of the testimony we have heard about the concerns about what the impact would be. I think this would be a reasonable way for us to study what the impacts are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Learn what the impacts are and take further action at that time. That is the substantive portion of my motion. The secondary portion is a pathway to $15 per hour. If after the study, the said study, we see no major negative impacts to jobs and the local economy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We continue on a pathway to $15 an hour whereby one on January one, 2020, we would increase the wage to $15 an hour and to on January one, 2021, we would increase the wage to $15 an hour. Small businesses and nonprofits with 25 or fewer employees would get an additional year to implement this schedule.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in 2023, the minimum wage will be set. We'll set the consumer price index for the L.A. metropolitan area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the that's the motion on the floor. Councilman Richardson, you're the second on that. Okay. So let me let me go to a thank you, Vice. See, and I've got a Councilman Richardson and then I have a long speakers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And I've taken my time to listen to all the testimony tonight and my council colleagues. And I got to tell you, what I prepared tonight has has dramatically changed from all the different comments and hearing sort of the different issues that want to be discussed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to thank all the people who it's past 11:00 and my wife is still struggling to get the baby down, but she's watching at home. And just you know, it's amazing that this issue is so so many people are passionate about this issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to acknowledge the commission, the Economic Development Commission, the Human Relations Commission, city staff, everyone who's done work on this. You all have gone through this. And this is the first time the city council gets to evaluate what that commission has been evaluating for a while.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that should be noted. This is not a new issue. It's been studied and studied. We have to two studies here in Long Beach. There have been studies over the ages about this. And there are great points and there are not so great points and there are positive and negative points out there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So so for me, it's it's it comes down to what is the intent and what are your what are your values as an organization in terms of what you hope to achieve as a minimum with a minimum wage?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If I think about a minimum wage, I'm thinking, what does this. What what is the purpose? And in my opinion, it's to make sure people aren't taken advantage of. And if you work a day's wage, you should get a fair, fair day's work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the question is, what is fair? If you believe in a minimum wage, you should believe that folks should be should get a fair wage. So let's tackle that question. Well, the study presents a number of different findings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I noticed that there was a a survey of businesses so, so quickly in this survey, how city manager how many of the what was the percentage of businesses that said they would close should we move forward with an action tonight?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As I recall, it was 0% and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I wanted to make sure we highlight that because I've gotten a lot of veiled threats about, hey, this is going to make force all these businesses to close. But an unbiased survey of how many? 600. 600 businesses? 0% indicated that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And during the process of this survey that we survey, the working poor low wage workers or receive their input through a process of a survey as well about how they would spend any additional revenue should that be created.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the survey instrument actually was specific to businesses. We did hear a lot of that through the public comment, but the actual survey instrument was four 600 randomly sampled businesses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it would be tough to. So I saw a a a slide and I heard a lot of comment about how people would spend this wage. How did we come to that, come to those assumptions if we didn't provide a survey to impacted low wage workers?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we'd have to ask the ADC to talk about that, their methodology, if you'd like an answer to that question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Vice Mayor Lowenthal brought up the issue of what what the poverty line is in Long Beach. And I want in. And so I understand that everyone across the nation uses the same federal poverty poverty line. But is there some sort of a local poverty line that for, say, a family of four?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So while the poverty line is the 24000 to 54 family for the federal level that the vice mayor mentioned, we do look at a number of other indicators, including something called area median income and area median income, which what the state is kind of considering moderate to and meets the definition of moderate for an affordable housing perspective'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is about $75,000 within the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So for so, a more reasonable poverty line would be $75,000 annually for a family of four, and that's with two workers in the household. Have we calculated what the annual wage would be should someone receive a $13 an hour or $15 an hour minimum wage?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And how that compares to the income poverty line for a family for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think part of that was part of the lead study, if we can ask Christine to answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So I want to applaud the Economic Development Commission for the framework. I want to applaud COBR and everyone else who provided the recommendation. Did any other commission provide a recommendation on the minimum wage?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. We for city commissions, we had the Human Relations Commission did provide support letter and you have that in your packet today. They made that action on Thursday and that was provided today to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what was the recommendation to support?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe up to a $15, $15 an hour wage.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is there a reason why that wasn't set next to the IDC's recommendation or the COBR recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because that came that recommendation was done on Thursday, and the staff report's been out for a much longer than that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That makes sense. Was the COBR, the council request, the COBR recommendation, or did we request the Economic Development Commission recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, the only study that was actually commissioned by the study was the L.A. EDC study and then the Economic Development Commission, which is the city commission. COBR and the Economic Roundtable were separate efforts that were not related to the city, but we definitely heard their input at the Economic Development Commission, and that helped to inform the Economic'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Development Commission's recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I just want to make sure that what's presented to the public, because I did. You're right. I did receive the recommendation from the other commission and I wouldn't want to discount any commissioners service on this on this critical issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, just to clarify, I think the probably the difference is that both commissioners did a recommendation, but one, there was only one commission that was asked to make a recommendation from the council. And so I think that's what staff did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the HRC weighed in on their own, but that's I think, probably the difference.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I get that, Mr. Mayor, and I appreciate that. I was just concerned because I saw the COBR recommendation in the official presentation when I know that we didn't commission that. And it's great that COBR stepped up to provide that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I want to make sure all the perspectives were represented in this discussion. A few more a few more questions. So if the if we said so, if we said that it's $75,000 is the poverty line for a family of four.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'By my calculations, if you raise the wage at $13 an hour, that's roughly $27,000 a year or $15 an hour. That's roughly $31,000 a year. So that doesn't quite get you to, you know, out of poverty. But while it doesn't get you there, if you have two, two workers in one household, if they work hard and never'",
        "'speaker_11': 'miss a day of work, but if they work, never miss a day of work beyond what's mandated by the state for sick days, they would make $62,000 a year at $15 an hour. So that's still that's still below $75,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if someone works at 15, $15 an hour. It's it doesn't get you out of poverty. This is by no means a living wage, but it does help put you on the path to get out of poverty. So that makes me think of.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when when I was when I was a kid. So I was raised by a single mom who worked as a nurse's aide and worked part time at Jack in the Box. And when myself and my sister were in high school and we have a little brother, we both worked part time, we both worked part time jobs'",
        "'speaker_11': '. I worked at Jack in the Box and my sister worked a part time job in town and we didn't make very much money, but we did pick up a bill. I had the light bill. She had, I think the phone bill.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We didn't have cell phones at the time. They weren't really big. They were really expensive at the time. So so certainly I do, you know, support the concept of youth jobs. They teach valuable lessons. But wouldn't it be great if if Mom just made a few dollars more so that that, you know, high school Kid X maybe'",
        "'speaker_11': 'has to make a choice about whether he wants to work and doesn't have to pick up that extra bill might have been a hundred bucks a month, but that was my commitment. There's an interesting slide. The one that stood out to me most here was that average household expenditures in Long Beach, $69,484, I believe it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, I mentioned I have a I have a one year old and we just got a quote for childcare. And I'm looking at what childcare costs annually. And it is more than, you know, childcare annually is actually could potentially be higher than the poverty level for an individual in our federal poverty level.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's. It seems like sort of it seems pretty blatant to me that we have to make something, make something happen here. So I think that the main motion, the motion here that takes us to 13 and puts us on a path to 15 with the studies and all that, but puts us on a path.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that that takes the pressure off this concept of working poor. I think that's important. I think the other element, Vice Mayor Lowenthal, that you mentioned on strong local wage and for enforcement, I think that's important. So I'm certainly in support of that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I would say that the only I heard a lot of comment about sort of youth workers. So I would say my thought there is that as I think back to my time as a as a youth worker, you know, I you know, I started off I think I was I was, you know, I worked for'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a nickel sort of a nickel arcade and were a little wore a little funny vest. I was a guy who stood on the corner with a desk man holding up a sign. And I had a you know, it was kind of embarrassing, but I did it because, you know, I needed I needed a job.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So my my circumstance was is I would think, uniquely different because I was a student, I was a high school student working on a permit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Holt. I would think. Okay. Ma'am. You did.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I hope it's not impacting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, it actually is impacting the audience. And so you cannot do that. So one more time and you just did something that you did last time, which we had to stop the meeting for. Do not do that again, please, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're trying to be respectful, okay? Okay. So if you do that again, I'm going to take another recess. I go to the prosecutor ask you, don't do it again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilman. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So entire.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just want to get through again. Through this. Go ahead. Can I can I can press through. So so the point I'm making is I think there's you know, I, I certainly see the value in giving a shot in the arm to the working poor addressing this issue of poverty.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think when I've heard a lot of recommendations about youth workers and I was a youth worker, I certainly understand I would want to sort of ask that. I remember when I was work, youth work, I had to have a work permit that ensured that, you know, I met academic requirements.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, I didn't drop below a certain GPA. All of that was managed through most through the school district. And I want to make sure that if we if we do anything around youth today, that we understand the distinct difference between a person that's working at Jack in the Box like myself and going to school, or the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'person who's head of Household under 18 emancipated serve, you know, working just like an adult. I think those are two distinctly different circumstances. I would hate to say if something happens, if there's any exception here, that it would impact unfairly someone who's essentially no different than a 19 year old who's working or a 22 who's working in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'one of these low wage jobs. So I'm going to pose that as a question to to the city manager. Are you familiar with this, with the whole work permit process?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, Mr. Mayor, members of the council, we are by no means experts in that type of situation. But from what we understand, there is a requirement under state law to get a work permit if you are under 18 and that is normally issued by the school district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then there are certain exemptions for certain classifications of of of minors. For example, some minors that have a GED can be less than 18 and not have to get a permit. But if you're under 18, you need a permit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's certainly something that we can research more and find out from our school district what those different exceptions are. Also, I do want to make a quick clarification. We talked about the $75,000 number. You know, poverty level really is the 24000 to 50.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is a definition in federal law of poverty level. The 75,000 is trying to give an example of in Long Beach and in L.A. County, more of what the area median income is and what the state considers more of a, you know, needing assistance for housing, for moderate income.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Certainly. And I get it. Thank you so much. So I would just ask that, you know, whatever happens tonight, we make sure that we. Is it true that that whole work permit process is handled by the school district?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have no.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. It's not a city function, but handled through the school district, under the under the direction of the Department of Industrial Relations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think we should certainly engage them in a discussion about, you know, how do the I mean, I want a better understanding of how they handle emancipated workers disconnected, disconnected students who are people who are no longer in school and have no connection to the school district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Like, I would be curious about how we handle that because the last thing I would do want to do is create an exception system, exemption system that is easy to game and somehow does the opposite of what we would like to do, which is help to assist people out of poverty through through this, this action.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that said, I'm supportive of the motion both elements. And and thank you for the motion, vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight. I think that this was a very good discussion. I know that many of you have come out three and four times as we've held the E.D. and F committee meetings all over the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate the dedication it takes to come each and every time and hear from others. So. With that in mind, I do also want to thank Lady Coba and the others who worked really hard to provide us with options.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that in kind of pairing on what Lisa Ranallo said. I grew up in a family that had a deadbeat dad who didn't pay child support and a mom who didn't go to college because she got married and wanted to help run a family business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when you get divorced, you then can't work for that family business anymore. And you not only have two kids to support, but you have no income. And so I started working at age 15 and a half. I got my youth permit, my work permit, and I worked starting at 15 and a half.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I believe in building those skills because at 15 and a half and sometimes 16, and some kids that I've had as interns, even 17 and 18, the the change in in them during that time is remarkable. And it's so much easier to hire a 20 year old or a 21 year old or a 23 year old'",
        "'speaker_1': ', quite honestly. I would like to also build on the comments of what I will call Commissioner Larkin today, but as I knew him originally, he was a white board member working really hard for the untrained, long term employed workers to help them out of poverty before this discussion ever started.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, I mean, honoring that, I'd like to propose a friendly amendment. I'd like to let's see. I've prepared a few notes. So bear with me as we walk through this in consideration of the many federally funded youth employment programs which I've talked about since well before this dialog started, since the day I was elected, I've really championed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what Commissioner Larkin and I talked about, oh, so long ago. But these federal youth employment programs and to support the mayor in his continued efforts to expand on the paid internships available in Long Beach, let's incentivize businesses to hire interns and through the VOA program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to do that and to hire our long term unemployed, our foster youth, our reentry, our CalWORKs and our homeless vets so that they can get the job experience that they need to build their skills. I proposed a business incentive to utilize the state wage for youth through age 21, and the dole defined youth including but not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'limited to homeless vets in reentry as defined by we a title one B title we owe we owe a title one B title we owe a title two we owe a title three and we owe a Title four as defined in the state plan to pull our most vulnerable and unemployable out of poverty.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that their research is just as admirable as the research that we've done here today on a statewide level. This is the commitment that all workforce investments have united behind, and I think it's really imperative that we do that here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hope that you'll consider that friendly amendment both very.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mayor. Members of the council. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm trying to make sure I understand the amendment as you've proposed, Councilwoman. Is it a youth exemption? And you mentioned veterans also reserves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in the VOA language, it specifically outlines who qualifies to be paid by the federal government for these job programs. So I'm saying youth up to age 21 and those defined in the program.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And and what were you proposing? That they be paid?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The state wage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'State minimum.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Wage. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So may I ask for clarification as well? When you say youth up to the age of 21. Do you mean youth that qualify for those programs and are also being incentivized through those programs or all youth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to ensure that so so our internship program doesn't only target we awa our internship program targets all youth in Long Beach. And when we when we stepped forward as a city to say we have some of the lowest rates of internship for the number of jobs in the city, we wanted to double and triple that and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we don't specifically target we also I feel that it's kind of a two parter. One is youth up to age 21 and then any we owe a definition because within the VOA program, there are certain youth categories specifically in reentry and foster emancipation and our veterans that go up to age 22 or some specific definitions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the WIA draft was provided to our offices in a correspondence. So I tried to call out we had Title one B and I don't know if legally I have to say we owe a title in front of all of them, but we owe a title one, B, two, three and four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that that really aligns with the state's goal of hiring the long term unemployed. And the long term unemployed in Long Beach actually are concentrated in our sixth district. And the mayor kind of highlighted that in the state of the city over a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for us to really get those individuals back to work, if we do not consider this business incentive, then there would be less potential hours available for them to build those skills. And the federal government kind of came up with what that model looks like in a number of hours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we we can't really change the hours as much as we can. The only option if we don't put in this business incentive would be to reduce the number of individuals who have access to the programs. So that would be my hope is that this council would be able to afford those long term unemployed, those opportunities'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I think going down a path to support business incentives is one that I certainly would support. And it. What you propose is is intriguing and interesting. And if you'll let me just digest it while others are talking so I can take a little bit of time and sit with it for a minute, I'd appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it is interesting and I do think we're on the right path.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful. And then just for a point of clarification, that's not against your first motion. That's when you have to motions. So I don't know if I have to speak on one motion or the other or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I have actually right now just one motion that no one has called to separate. Oh. So got it. Is that correct? Mr..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe that you had identified you wanted two separate motions. Were you identified? Yes. You've laid out kind of the entire range.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. I do want two separate motions, I. I said both components at once. Yes. Okay, great. Yes, you're right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope it would carry on to the second, but I think it's important against the first. Okay. And then I have one other friendly amendment. In consideration of our desire to focus our efforts on bringing people out of poverty.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to ask that we request the City Attorney's Office to follow the state movement on the total compensation model and provide written correspondence to the Council, including a legal opinion onto total earnings at his earliest convenience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I recognize that that might take. A bit because it's still developing, but I'd hope it would be back in 45 days or I know we have this coming back, so I don't know the timeline, but as soon as reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're asking just for information when you ask for that friendly. Yes. And this is information that the city attorney would gather on total compensation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I tried to use it. I think we would all call it a two from four, but I think the public would recognize it as a written correspondence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think as long as we're just asking the city attorney to research and provide information, that would be. I can accept that at this time. Thank you. You're welcome.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kate thinks Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think my comments have to come at a later point to where we are in this. So I'd like to. Sure thing. Hold on for just a second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No problem. We have plenty more people. So many chance to come back. Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank everybody for hanging with us this evening. And I know this is a very important issue to a lot of people. I think this is a historic day for our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I feel for, one, very fortunate to be here in service at this time in our city's history. I want to especially thank those who helped us get here to this point, especially our Economic Development Commission, who I applaud because I had an opportunity to sit and I wasn't here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I streamed the meeting last week. It was much like this one this evening, and I know there were many others leading up to that point. And so these commissioners have certainly risen to the level of service of the city, to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I wanted to express my appreciation to them. They fought for a commission that was just created a few months ago. You know, we may think about compensating them in the future because there was a lot of hard work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you very much to the commissioners who served on that commission. I think that commission was was diverse and I come in it as well, that I was actually pleasantly surprised that they reached the conclusion that they did reach because their recommendations actually move the ball forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's it's it's progress. And I know it was a lot of tough wrangling for for those those on that commission to to get to where they did in the decision before us today. So I also want to thank the many activists from the Raise the Wage campaign, L.A. County Fed for continuing to push the organizing the community'",
        "'speaker_4': '. The many contacts that I've had via email, Twitter, one on one conversations have been very fruitful, and I appreciate it. And our business leaders who have come forward and given us perspectives to think about as a as a council, as policymakers, you know, please understand, you're not victims here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I think we all will win at the end of the day. And Long Beach will be a better city for the decision that we make this evening. I have no doubt that we are going to raise the wage this evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to thank the the the the the LED, EDC and COBRA, the chamber. I mean, this was a full it was this was an open, transparent process. Everybody had a seat at the table. Everybody had an opportunity to to to share their viewpoints.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this was this was the Long Beach way. If anything, I think it was open. And and and and the decision we make this evening, I think we'll feel good about it from the standpoint that we know that we had full input from everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From my perspective, I think things are really looking up for Long Beach. I want to be very clear. I came out and I endorsed a statewide minimum wage. Months ago. I think that's the way for the state to go in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we are going to to set, set, set a standard and we're going to lead the way helped lead the way to getting the state of California there. And the decision before us is a major decision that will change our city and change lives in our city for the better.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we have an opportunity. We heard a lot about addressing poverty this evening and quality of life for those who are willing to work and make an honest living. And in the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King, we celebrated his his birthday just yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All labor has dignity, but it's especially has dignity. If you can, you know, have a quality of living. And you can you can you can live on what you earn. I, too, got a work permit at 15 and a half.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I took opinions and surveys in the mall, got the opportunity to deal with difficult personalities and learn how to how to deal with rejection. Help me with my dating game many years later. But. That that valuable experience helped shape my my career.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It helped shape my who I am today because I had an opportunity to work as a young person. I'm passionate about getting people out of poverty, but I'm also passionate about young people and getting our young people prepared and building our workforce for the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, you know, I'm interested in in doing more. I don't think we we necessarily have to get it all right this evening, you know, because the last time I checked, this will be an audience on any given Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can change an audience. We can we can tweak an ordinance. We can fix an ordinance. We can we can improve our policies. And so I think this is a great first step for the city of Long Beach to to to to move and show commitment to the workers throughout our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think raising the wage here will act dignity and increase economic opportunity for thousands of workers in our city. We have an opportunity to do that this evening. And those workers have many faces and backgrounds. They are youth, they're seniors, they're students.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're our neighbors. And they are every ethnicity they are. The people who provide service and work in our retail and fast food establishments. And so the minimum wage will work well. We will, I think, make a great first step this evening and an understanding, listening to to some of our businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think there are there's some sticker shock here because, you know, the rally cry is for 15 and we are going to create a pathway to 15. But this is going to be a phased in approach. And when I look at the the history of the minimum wage in California, it has gone up incrementally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's gone up year by. When it has gone up, it has gone up 8%. 10%, and I think we are being consistent with that in this regard and understanding that there were many years where the minimum wage did not move.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is why we have this great movement to try to raise wages. I've said from the very beginning, a rising tide will lift all boats. And so there's not this comparison issue. If the minimum wage is is $15 in 2021, whatever, if you're making $20 today, I think you'll be making more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Quite, quite frankly, in 2021, when when the minimum wage is $15. The rising tide will lift all boats. And I think doing nothing will change nothing. And so we have a unique opportunity in front of us to make change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did want to offer a friendly amendment as well, because with that commitment and passion to getting interns involved in our city and getting our young people important training and opportunities in the workforce, I think it's important that we build in that an understanding that we want to incentivize our businesses to hire young people as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So given how important it is to provide training and learning opportunities, especially for members of underrepresented in high poverty communities, I think it's and since it's essential to create incentives for employers to hire and train interns and first time workers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Therefore, I'd like to propose the following friendly amendment to the current motion, and I'm not sure if this is the first or second, but we'll just get it in there. Hopefully you'll accept it. Vice Mayor Create a new working intern amendment that would allow employers to pay 85% of the minimum wage for 480 hours or six months'",
        "'speaker_4': ', whichever is sooner for employees in any job or activity in which they have no previous or similar rate related experience. And I think that'll go a long way toward getting young people the opportunity to to work. And I express my concern when this first came before us that, you know, I thought our young workers would have a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hard time competing to have a first job. And I think this might address some of the concerns raised by by Commissioner Larkin, as well as my colleague, Councilmember Mungo. So that's my friendly voice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mary Ford Just real quick, just to clarify one thing before Vice-Chair. So I know that I think the city of Santa monica, I think passed something similar, similar to that recently and just that I feel that I understand as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the intention of that is to allow first time workers that are going into a job that's for a set period of time. So an internship or a seasonal job or their first time job. So it's something that certainly either lasts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think your numbers were there six months or 480 hours, whichever comes first of those two. And so I know that was what the Santa monica, something similar had passed in Santa monica.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think the state labor code is very clear on what an intern is and what would a learn worker is. I mean, I think, you know, they don't necessarily this is not a way to to undercut labor costs necessarily.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are these are workers who will be trained and have training opportunities with an employer in a paid internship. And I can tell you, I have offered opportunities, and I know there are a lot of internships out there that are unpaid.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And so this this would actually create a pathway for paid interns throughout our city. And I know that's been a big, big priority of yours, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. And I and I do like what obviously what Santa monica did in that direction. So. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And. I think that captures the spirit of what we had heard about people's interest in incentivizing. Trainees and and new workers to an industry. I just have one question. So in that 85% calculation. Is that would that ever take it lower than the state minimum wage?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if the state minimum wage is $10 an hour. So for instance, the first step of our minimum wage is $10.50. So that would not be applicable at that time. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe it would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think so. I think this might be a step.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Modica might know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So it's our understanding that there currently is a provision in state law for learners that is 85% of workers. So in that case, they wouldn't be any different any any different than what state law already allows. We'd have to verify that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that language that Santa monica uses sounds very similar to what is currently in state law, but will verify.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So as long as we're aligning to what is allowable under state law, I think that's your intent. Councilmember Austin Then I would accept that friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just to be clear, though, it is the Santa monica law that passed is not the same thing as a state law. And so I think the Santa monica law applies especially to this idea of it's not so much focus on on youth as it is this idea of like interns and seasonal employees or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what Councilmember Austin's proposing is interns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seasonal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And seasonal employees, not just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Youth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, it's less about age and more about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And I think we would struggle with that age distinction. But it's the trainee concept, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a training concept. And I think it it meets the spirit of what the what Councilmember Mango was actually trying to put forth in her friendly as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Doing it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. And I heard what Councilmember Mungo had asked for. And I think in in hearing your request, your proposal and Councilmember Austin's proposal, I, I, I do lean toward what I'm hearing from his proposal because a couple of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One, it is it's a little bit more clear from from an understanding. For our to prioritize the trainee piece, which I think was key for you as well. The new worker piece. I like the cap of 460 Hours, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': '80 hours. This addresses the issue that Councilman Richardson raised and others raised about not taking advantage of people, keeping them locked into certain wage categories. And so it really does. It's credible as a trainee incentive, the new employee incentive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I will accept that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me go to Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vice Mayor. I don't think I'm going to sit here and wait. All you guys have to listen to all of this because the fact I have a pretty good idea of my opinions and how I feel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'About a lot of this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because first and foremost, I want to thank the, you know, the City Economic Commission for their recommendation and the students who came here tonight. I know it's been a long, you know, time, but when this item first came to the city council, you know, I was coauthor, you know, with our vice mayor, Lowenthal, and there were more'",
        "'speaker_6': 'people earning minimum wage in my district and any other district in the city of Long Beach. Which came.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Out early.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To create a pathway to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Support the $15 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A pathway to the $15 an hour. And I don't like it, so I don't see where any of this will bring anybody out of poverty.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But there is a pathway. You know, like I said, we talked it back in days. You know, we talked about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The minimum wage in the other wages. Like I said, when we talk about minimum wage, you know, it doesn't fit the criteria where we you because we talk about today in the economy the way it is, it would never, ever come to, you know, to equal each other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I've heard that the pros and cons of, you know, why we should it should not increase the wages. But I really think that we. Speaking of that, Dr. King, you know, we really need to move forward in that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I think we need to move forward tonight. And I've been waiting, you know, you know, in hopes for a long time. And I think it's really time for us to act, you know, really seriously. I heard the rising tide, but I think the rising tide with this will be with the votes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it's time for us to move on with this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Instead of taking all these people's time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember your income. Sorry. I mean, I'm sorry about that, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Thank you. So a great discussion tonight. I want to thank everybody for being here again. The business community, our nonprofits, our L.A. County Fed, our workforce here in and all over the city. I want to thank everybody for their hard work.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I know it was a lot to come to this night and to really talk about all of the possibilities and possible solutions. So I'm happy that we've now been able to discuss this in a way that looks like we're moving towards a minimum wage here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so what I will say, you know, just to give us a larger context, and I think we do have a larger context in this. We've talked about poverty levels, unemployment rates. You know, I happen to represent an area I know I sound like a broken record, but at one point was 19%.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's actually lowered. You know how I'm happy about that to 16 point about 5% homelessness. We have about 2300 adults that are homeless here in the city of Long Beach. And over 75% percent of them are of working age.'",
        "'speaker_12': '255 are children and 20%. We know our city citywide are living in poverty. Median income, 15,000, $50,000 in in the downtown area, which is great. And the reason I say that is because I have to care about these statistics, because, of course, I represent them, but also because particularly in the downtown area, you know, when major retailers'",
        "'speaker_12': 'come to us and they've come to the Dolby or they've come to the city to look at it areas, you know, we've often struggled with our income rates. We've often struggled with retailers telling us that we don't have the income.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so I think now looking at this minimum wage and seeing what this could possibly have the opportunity for us to do is to potentially raise our income levels in a way that would also hopefully raise education levels as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'For instance, I know Trader Joe's particularly one has talked about not coming to Long Beach because we don't have the education. And so there's other retailers, of course, like I said, that won't come to Long Beach maybe because we don't have the particular income levels.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so we see a benefit in that sense that will help other businesses as well. In addition to that, I think a second point, as I mentioned, is just the the the varying levels that we have of various poverty levels.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Even median home values are about $400,000. Average studio one bedroom is about $1,000, upwards of 2600 if you're needing a three or four bedroom. So it's pretty significant. Another point, I think that a lot of the business community brought forward, but many others have brought forward many times is wage theft.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think I want to thank Vice Mayor Lowenthal for including that in talking about retaliation, talking about wage stuff like it needs to be talked about because I think that there is a really important fact here. It is very similar to what we're discussing, but also very distinct.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think having that discussion in a study when we do see it back in a way that's comprehensive but really tackles the issue as best, especially with specific industries, which is very important. But overall, an increase in the minimum wage is more than fair, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It acknowledges our city's demographic demographic make up of individuals who, yes, they cook our food, entertain our tourists, take care of our children. Ten tables we meet at, they fix our sandwiches, you know, everything. And we've often supported many businesses with various business license fees, maybe waiving those.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have grants for for businesses. We have workforce development opportunities for businesses. And I think at this point, it's really an opportunity for us as a city to really look at individuals more than just a dollar amount, but really value them for the work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I think looking at the vice mayor's plan so far in the Economic Development Commission's plan and again, I want to thank our business community, I want to thank everyone that was involved. I think it is unprecedented that we've come to this point and that everyone has been involved.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I want to also commend our council for having a great discussion and really looking at a pathway to 15. And so I will be on board with support on the vice mayor's motions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next step is actually Mr. City attorney. Did you want to jump.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Real quick? Excuse me, Councilman, your clarification on the vice mayor's motion. I was looking at my notes here. On the second part, you said nonprofits and those companies of 25, unless the nonprofit is not, is there a employee number for the nonprofits?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is it all nonprofits and small companies of 25?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're they're both 25 or fewer employees.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So nonprofits that have 25 or fewer employees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For small businesses and nonprofits with 25 or fewer employees.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There would be no distinction or necessary to say if you're just seeing companies with 25 or less.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can say that. I think I raised the distinction because there was a distinction made in public comment. But if you felt that it would be captured just by saying businesses. I want to be sure that we're not providing that exemption.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just want to be clear that the way I read the CDC report, it appeared to say all nonprofits and small companies of 25 or less. And what I now understand, it's only nonprofits of 25 or less or small.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Companies, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Contrary, Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Now, I'm not going to belabor this point. I think that we are on the right path. I think that we have basically discussed this item to its dnouement, as far as I can tell. We're going we're going in the direction that's going to take us to a path for $15 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I really appreciate all of councilmember for bringing that that opportunity here. It's it's serves the best of all worlds in respect to the commission's recommendations. And I want to thank everybody, everybody who was involved in this and those of you who are out there right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good morning. Because you've been here a long time. It's been a long day. And I'm sure that you're very tired and you want to see a vote being taken. So I'm not going to take a lot more of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think that when it comes down to the opportunity, what we're looking here at the table, the motions that are on the table, there's something that they are. They are motions that I can agree with, because it does take us to that path where we need to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I could talk about my my early work experience selling maps to the stars and how much I made. And I was doing that. I know how many of you have gone to Hollywood and bought a map? You know, when I was doing that, it was great by center with $0.50 on the dollar and didn't make much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I didn't need a permit because in those days they were looking at that, you know, more like childcare laws didn't fit in. And I could also talk about me being a portfolio transfer engineer back when they had those, you know, fulfilling filling your car with with gas washing, which you average and kicking the wheels to put air'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So, I mean, I could talk about all of that, but I'm not going to think I just did. But bottom line is that we definitely need an increase in and a low in wages. It's long, very long overdue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that, you know, when we did the comments that were made earlier about measure in, you know, the sky did not fall. In fact, we rebounded and we're doing even better now than we did in the past.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm ready to vote on this and I support it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Going back to Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, actually, Charlie, just the city attorney just reminded me, you know, in looking through the commission's recommendation, you're absolutely right. And my intent was to stay with the commission's recommendation. It is very late. I don't know how many of you think clearly at 12:15 a.m., but so thank you for that reminder.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My intent is to stay with the commission recommendation, which is small businesses and all nonprofits. As for both for both pieces. The piece about the one year. DeLay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the second piece. Right. That's it for both pieces. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I appreciate Councilmember Austin's. Friendly with the state recommended training program. It doesn't fulfill my complete intent because where I think the disadvantage will come is that there's, again, a serious maturity variance between a 16 year old and an 18 year old.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll I'll be supportive of that as a part of this motion, even though I'm very disappointed that the full. Acknowledgment of individuals up to age 21 at the state wage is only still pending at this time, but I hope it will be considered.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do want to speak one more time on the. We owe it, though, because I think that that we owe a component is critical to our ability to lobby this in DC. I think it's critical to our ability to lobby this in Sacramento, and I think it's critical in the future of the way we our was written'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in that from here forth we are going to be allocated funds based on performance. And so our ability to have the number of youth go through the program will be less because of this and therefore could long term reduce the num the total amount of allocation of funds.'",

Utilize the state minimum wage for participants while in the program, which again has some of the restrictions, as Councilmember Alston said, with the 480 hours of certain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'groups, but within certain groups, for instance. Veterans. Unemployable veterans. There are certain changes in the timeline of when you can place them. And specifically within L.A. County, we set aside $1,000,000 a few years ago to put these in the number of individuals that were requested by the federal government into work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with the big push that we're doing to reduce veteran homelessness, we did not meet those goals. And part of that was not being able to meet those goals within the state minimum wage. Within this under that under that time when we asked for that $1 million to be set aside, and we were very grateful for it'",

Not everybody's going to get everything they want. But I do feel that we should make sure that we're at you know, we're playing our part in the region.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry about that. Actually, I'm next on the list. Just just to two quick things really quick. Some of this was discussed earlier. I just want to reiterate something before we just passed over the during earlier earlier today, the L.A. EDC, when they presented they made a series of recommendations as business incentives, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just want to make sure that we and I don't know if this needs to be part of the motion or not, but I just want to ask staff to at least those I think need to come back to the council, or there needs to be some kind of discussion about those incentives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they included everything from expanding the local preference program to our enterprise funds. I actually really like that. I know we don't do that now, but I think a lot of the recommendations that they made, I think the idea of expanding local preference to, you know, to the port and to the water department and to all the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'enterprise funds, I think would actually be a big benefit to local workers and so and small businesses. So I just want to make sure that that's something that is looked at encouraging that for the community college district in Cal State, Long Beach was mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to make sure that we're doing that as well. And the other two items and vice mayor, if you would consider also they're not exactly germane to to the motion schedule that you set, but I think they still they still have an impact.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One thing that was discussed, I've heard it at some of the hearings is this idea of creating some kind of business incentive to either whether it's a a a, a business license fee, tax holiday or whether it's a business license fee opportunity so that businesses that are going to be you know, obviously there will be impact, but'",
        "'speaker_0': 'there's also some kind of incentive on the city side. And so I don't know, vice mayor, if we could add, if staff could bring back some type of license fee tax holiday, I know that. I think Councilwoman Mango and Councilwoman Price and Councilmember Brenda, I think it was had have proposed initiated a small business rebate program and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'which I think is great. I think we all supported great program. But I think that this could be something that whether it's a part of it or on top of that to create some kind of some kind of license fee benefit for businesses as an incentive, I'd like to look at that so that something we could bring'",
        "'speaker_0': 'back and I think you mentioned, Mr. Mauka in your presentation that there was you already had a kind of cost to what that could look like. And so I'd like to actually have that come back to the Council for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can we could we do that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So we can certainly take a look at the recommendations in the L.A. EDC. And one thing I did want to add is one of the recommendations was to ask our local educational institutions to also do a local preference program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Would that be part of the motion as well? It would. And then we can we've got some of the costs already for the business license holiday, if you will, that's in the in your motion to air in the materials today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can also cost out expanding our current small business rebate program and bringing that up to potentially 20 employees or 25 employees. It's currently set at ten employees. So we can bring back some additional information on that program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We were just discussing that actually with and actually that would be great. And if I think you could, particularly if we're classifying businesses as 25 small businesses as 25 and under, I think to take that program and expand that for not just those that are under ten, but those that are at the 25 level, I think provides'",
        "'speaker_0': 'more, you know, tax incentives and, you know, reduction of fees for businesses at that level. And so if we could get those get kind of a listing of business incentives and what the kind of responses from city and vice mayor, if you would be willing just to as a side add, that I would.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I first like to get a point of clarification from the city attorney on the total earnings piece coming back. If you could just kind of recap what you're doing. And I'd also like to ask that that piece come back prior to the final reading, if it's going to be in an analysis that that you are'",
        "'speaker_7': 'providing. I think council needs some time to analyze what you're analyzing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Supernova. Yes. It's my intention to take a look at this and put an opinion together for the review by the Council prior to the first reading of what does come back on is should this motion be successful and we're directed to prepare an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So yes, I mean, we would take a look at that total earnings. We'll give you our best analysis. I think the people that spoke about it, you know, it's going to be there's no definitive answer out there that they can someone can point to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But we will take a look at it and give you our best estimate on on that particular model.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. And I assume that's okay with the maker of the motion that it comes back prior to the first reading?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I guess what we have here is my fear is is just basically unintended consequences. And with all the speakers here tonight, no one gave me an answer as to what do I tell my fixed income constituents who have home health care?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They're going to lose hours, which is unacceptable. And I guess in hearing several folks say talk about the high price, I need more money because of the high price of child care. Where do they think the price of childcare is going to go?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's just that vicious cycle is what I have the biggest problem with. The other item that I'm kind of confused by and in the hours late. So I'm kind of ready for confusion here. But the whole wage theft issue, to me, this is a state issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's the California Department of Industrial Relations. We had a new bill there in 2011. I think the governor just signed a new measure in October 2015. I'm confused as to what we're going to do on a city level other than refer people to to get relief at the state area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know if anyone has an explanation for that tonight, but I'm just saying that that's something I don't understand. I think the state put $1,000,000,000 into enforcement plan in October. So, again, I'm unclear there with that. All that being said, I'd just like to thank everyone for your time tonight, the business owners.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And to Mr. Hoffman, I hope you do reinvest in Long Beach. And I think it's incumbent on us as we move forward is to create some of those business incentives. We need to do everything we can do to help the business community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. So now we go back to the motion and just I want to just try to repeat the motions or both. The vice Mayor There's two separate motions, so I'm going to let her repeat her two motions and make sure that we're on the same page before we go to the final vote.'",
