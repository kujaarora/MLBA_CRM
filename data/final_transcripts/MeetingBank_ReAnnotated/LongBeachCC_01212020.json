So let me be clear that this council has already been clear with the city staff that our recruitment is take too long and there's been an audit and a review of the onboarding process and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'When we know a person is going to be retiring out of a staff or a department that is so small, the recruitment should probably start before they retire. And so my next question is to City Manager Modica, because I know Hiroto is leaving any day now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We said the second part timer will start soon. What could we do as a line in the sand date that we can check back in? So that my staff will know.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So if they're ready to go, then they're ready to go. And occupational health is actually something that we're taking a very close look at. We hope by February to have a list of positions that won't need to go through occupational health anymore.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'So what can we do about that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll raise that with the civil service director. We clearly want to get either an unofficial or something into that position. If we have to take something to the Civil Service Commission to change things or ask for a provisional appointment, we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That would be great. I would love to hear back on a provisional appointment. A couple of things about the proposal tonight. So first and foremost, this says animal care's next steps. I think that this is animal care's proposed next steps.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This council tonight will make the decision on what those are. And I'd like to make a couple of modifications out of the gate. So I know we talk about a memorandum of understanding with SPCA, L.A.. I don't feel that that's strong enough.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think that in a lot of our other reports that we've talked about, the consistent terminology that Mr. Modica has used and has agreed is necessary in all of our agreements is an operating agreement. So Mr. Modica, can you give us a little bit of information about what the timeline might be for such an operating agreement?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So yes, in our original item that we brought forward, we were calling it a memorandum of understanding. We are changing that a little bit more to a formal agreement of what we call an operating agreement. I think that better clarifies what we're looking to do, that we want to outline all of the different provisions and really write'",
        "'speaker_7': 'down the stuff that is currently happening out there and also clarify things that are not happening out there that we would like to happen out there. I will ask Rado and Stacy to give us a more concise, more precise estimate of when we'd come back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My sense is we want to make a lot of progress in the next two months and really align this with the strategic plan. So when we're hearing back from the from the task force and are hearing back from the strategic plan that we come back, this is, of course, a negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They are not under any requirement to actually enter into an operating agreement with us. We have started those discussions with SPCA and we hope with the next 2 to 3 months, that will have a lot to report back on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Wonderful. I'd also like to modify the motion tonight to include a time certain to bring back a ordinance. We kind of talked about in the presentation a February or March date. I recognize that this council often is expected to have an ordinance that's so perfect that only ministerial changes could be proposed on the night the ordinance returns'",
        "'speaker_10': '. I'm not looking for that. I'm okay with it being a draft that we can make significant changes to. But I'd like to ask if the city attorney could, at research, if possible, to have that ordinance back by February 24th.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He said February or March. That's the last Tuesday meeting in February. If that's possible, that would be great. If it's not. Please let me know. And then the strategic plan. It was a broad date, if I know that's kind of based on a consultant.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if you could tell me a specific time certain that we could count on, that would be helpful. And then I'm just going to close with one last thing before we go to public comment, if possible. In 2015, I asked for our live releases to be a part of our open data portal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is not something that needs to be created. L.A. County Animal Control already has an internal open data portal. I specifically drew that to the bar graph that's possible that links directly to Chameleon, and the data can be drawn on a daily basis and it shows the number of live animal in LBS and then it shows the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'animal outcomes in a bar graph.

        "'speaker_10': 'they change on a daily basis because they pull directly from Chameleon. And this is not anything that needs to be created. It's all open to the public because it was created with government money. And here we are four years later and we don't have it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I know at the time we went through two different IT directors, but I'd like as a part of the. If there's more to from Forbes, I'd like a date that our live release rates will be a part of the open data portal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I don't know if it's here, but I want a date that that's possible if it's six months from now, tell me that. But I'd like to know when that's going to happen, and I want that to be a part of the motion with that councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. White, remember.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know you've asked for the February 24th date on the ordinance. The one of the ordinances that changes the number of animals has to go to a planning commission. So I don't think there's any way that we can bring this back to you on the 24th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It has to go to Planning Commission first.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Would we be able to do the part of the ordinance? The other two components that they're they're proposing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We could certainly attempt to bring back part of the audiences that don't have to go to a planning commission by the 24th.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. That would be fantastic. And with that, Mr. Vice Mayor, I'd be open to either hearing from Councilman Price my co motion or hearing from the public eye.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there anyone I would like to speak? I think I have. Uh. How many names you have?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have 19 that sign up for the public comments for this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can he go?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just want to add one more piece to the conversation. And I thought maybe doing it before a public comment might be more productive so that if members of the public want this particular issue addressed, perhaps it's going to get addressed right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I don't know. So, first of all, I want to thank our Parks Rec and Marine Department and specifically Stacey Daines. You have been a great addition to the team. I'm so grateful you're here. I'm grateful for your transparency, your authenticity, your willingness to work hard and truly your love for animals, which can be faked to some'",
        "'speaker_5': 'extent. But you it's real with you. I mean, it's it's genuinely real for you. This is not a job. You're not doing it because it's a job. You're doing it because you care. And that's that comes across clearly, I think, to any of us who work with you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for that. And I want to thank my colleague, Stacey Mungo for her comments. She's been very engaged on this topic, and I agree with everything she just said wholeheartedly. I know that I have met with many of the advocates.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Several of them live in my district and are my constituents, and I've had the pleasure and the opportunity to be able to sit with them on a number of occasions to talk about this specific issue. And I know that one of the biggest concerns for them and it makes a lot of sense to me and perhaps they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'brought it up to me because I'm an attorney, I don't know. But it's the terms of the lease. The terms of the lease are a major concern for me, and I agree. We need to look at an operating agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to look at an emotive issue. But I think we have a lease in place and my concern is that there are practices that have been developed over time that are outside the scope of the lease and outside the scope of the intent of the lease.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as part of this item, if it's okay with Councilmember Mungo, she's amenable to this, I would like to request the following. I'd like to request that the city attorney review the current lease between the City of Long Beach and SPCA, L.A., and meet with the SPCA, LA management team, the Lubbock's management team, and any other persons'",
        "'speaker_5': 'deemed by the staff or management team of either entity who have credible, relevant information to contribute to determine whether the current lease terms have been followed, whether they have been violations of the lease, and whether those violations warrant a modification or termination of the lease or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All conversations shall be protected as privileged communications and every effort shall be made to protect the identity of those who are expressing accounts or concerns regarding events and practices. And that provision, I'm not sure if it can legally be upheld, but I really want to protect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The individuals who might share concern from being. Retaliated against in some way. I just I want to make sure they're protected.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I appreciate your comments. And I would like to adopt some form of that. I know that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The report that also on the lease. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The report shall be deemed a priority and which should return back to council within 30 days in order to cease all practices and operations that are deemed to be non-compliant and or detrimental to the operations and functions of Al Bax.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I do know that in meeting with Art Cox in advance of this meeting, that they've reviewed the lease and started through a process of noticing. Is that something we can comment on at this time, or is that something that's under negotiations?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Could. Mr.. MODICA Well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's something that Heard can give you an update on. He has been actively doing that work with with the SPCA.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I think that the component of Miss Price and my I'm sorry, Councilwoman Price and my comments both now and then when I met with you previously, was the legal components that Mr. Cox is involved in. Mr. Tan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sorry, Cock Sanchez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, we can talk about that. The one of the issues that has been addressed is potential violations of the lease. And you only have a violation of the lease if the city were requested or the in this case wrote to the director of Parks and Marine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's the other side on notice and under the lease, they have 30 days to cure that default or potential violation of the lease. To my knowledge, we've never put them on a notice for those type of incidents. So and some of the incidents that have been raised, the statute of limitations probably has run on some of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if they were light violations at that time in 2005 or, you know, more than four years ago under the contract. So if there is an ongoing issue that staff believes they can't work out with our our tenant, in this case the SPCA, we could certainly work with them to write a notice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But before we get to that, obviously, we'd want to have negotiations with them to see if we could resolve it. Short of implementing the legal system, I don't not sure we could terminate the lease under anything I've seen so far.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have any grounds that I'd been put aware or made aware of that would result in some sort of termination. We have a I think a lease is in place till 2053. And so it is a long term partnership that we have with SPCA.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And but that said, we could certainly clarify some of the issues that have been raised and we would meet with SPCA and do that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think what has recently happened and Mr. Modica was present was that there were concerns about violations of the lease that were brought forward by the community, that were both brought to the attention of the Parks and Rec director, the assistant city manager.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there was a discussion about making sure that if there were violations, they were put on notice. So I guess, Mr. Modica, where any of the claims brought forward deemed to be founded and were they cured or was there a noticing that will need to take place or has taken place?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the director of Parks and Rec has brought those up to the attention of SPCA last week. We also put those in writing to them and and were at this point dealing with it through negotiation, saying here are things that we want to hear where we're proposing this operating agreement, because we think that is really the best'",
        "'speaker_7': 'way to address these going forward. We can look further at actual lease violations at this point. The things that have been raised to our attention, such as, you know, not being provided keys, those are getting addressed. And we have we have assurance from SPCA that they will give us keys to the to the common areas that is'",
        "'speaker_7': 'clearly in the lease. That is not under dispute. They owe us keys and we've asked for those and we will receive those. And if we don't, we would take that to the next level. I'd like Corrado to jump in and talk a little bit about the discussion that we had with SPCA and what specifically we have noticed'",
        "'speaker_7': 'them on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think it's important to to kind of let the community know how many meetings there have been with SPCA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With regards to these issues of concern. There's been to sit down meetings, very lengthy meetings, and such as as the city manager just mentioned, mentioning on our request. And then also it was put in writing that we going that develop an operating agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we brought up the issue of the keys, the shared keys in the common areas. We also brought up the issue of needing to have a mutual understanding on the placement of signs in common areas and also in the areas that is our bank specific footprint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we also how we need to have a really good, clear understanding because there have been instances there where there wasn't and how best to use the common areas as well as what are the common areas. So that needs to be clarified.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was brought up as well. And and then the effective programing of a joint One-Stop Adoption Desk, the adoption questionnaire was brought up with specific it has to be a jointly developed and owned document and. And and then not just even more clarity on, for example, during the summer season when we used the Benee pods and the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mighty mover in our area, there were concerns about whether we had the right to do so. We we did so. But we need to make sure that that gets established in writing so that there is no tensions with regards to using our footprint to the best of our ability when we have the needs to save our animals'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And from Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I appreciate your discussion related to the one stop. Many know that that's something that I'm very passionate about, that people would have the opportunity to know that they can adopt from Long Beach. I appreciate that you're addressing the adoption form.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think those are all things that have been brought to our attention by the community. I know Councilman Price said 30 days. I'd like to include the. Operation of the one stop launch and the adoption form. And with that, I'd like to open it up to potentially being 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so those would be included as well. Great. And then if we can, Mr. Vice Mayor, hear from the public and then potentially bring back to add additional. Opportunities to improve the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. The public place will call you names off and please come up. And you have 90 seconds. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the next five public comments. Could you please do mine up in the podium? Beverly Leifer, Joanne Quartz.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me. Excuse me 1/2. I'm sorry. Councilwoman Patricia. Okay. Okay, fine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beverly Reliever Joanne Coates, Laura, Selma, Alex Armstrong and Wang. Can you please come up and stand by the podium, please?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we only have one minute, 30 seconds. Yes. Okay. I'm Beverly Lifer. And first, I want to thank council members Pryce and Mungo for wanting the lease and potential violations to be investigated. This needs to be done prior to an operating agreement or ammonia or whatever you call it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I organize and peacefully demonstrate outside the State of the City event with a group of other animal advocates last Tuesday, like I did at last year's event, with no trouble. However, this year I was told by the head of security at this public event on public property that you, city council and the mayor stated that no signs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'were allowed within the security perimeter outside the building. Even the police agree that we were allowed and so were our signs. I checked before we even showed up. Unfortunately, the mayor's not here to the address, but the mayor and city council members have a history of restricting the public's comments and thoughts, as seen in the mayor's deletion'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of criticism of him on Facebook, limiting the time for public comments and now trying to remove people and their signs from a public event. Well, you can't and won't stop us from an acting our freedoms of assembly and speech.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you will never silence me or others from advocating for our city's pets. We demand that this city's animal shelter operate autonomously. All decision making should be made by the shelter manager or its city management. No private organization, including SPCA, L.A. should have unmitigated power to control.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Agency.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, my name is Joanne Frost. Thank you for your increased attention to Long Beach Animal Care stories. This past year. I've been advocating for Outback's reform for over 12 years, and after all these years, I finally feel a glimmer of hope today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks to many of you recently meeting with me and patient and listening to the unfortunate complex issue. So thank you very, very much. I am the family against entering into any additional agreements with SPCA until the violations and the current lease agreements are remedied.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. We do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You all have a letter at your desk from Best Friends Animal Society.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are a leading national welfare organization. They're dedicated to ending the killing of dogs and cats in America by 2025.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They have written, commending us for our work this year. And they also noted that to have continued progress, our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Municipal shelter needs autonomy and self-determination. They made note that our backs must be freely, must be free to choose the type of collaborations that save the most limited animals. As Ella Max is in the current state of evolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now maybe the time to review current partnerships to ensure alignment of goals and purpose. Meet the Compassion Saves Initiative. They believe independence is a logical next step to its long term success and sustainability. And then the last thing I have is a visual that you may have in your doc, in your this is the main building of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the common area. There's these pink areas that are highlighted. They we consider the valued space where animals can be housed and the veterinary areas. You'll see those pink arrows are all owned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are all taken over by SPCA. That's what we really need to get back as part of the lease. We don't need an operating agreement to get that taken care of. Thank you. My name is Laura Selmer, vice mayor and council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for the leadership. With the animal care services last year, having the lowest euthanasia rate in our history was a true accomplishment. I want to give a shout out to Stacy Danes and her team. You are saving lives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another deserving Shoutout goes to Hiroto Mourad for his insightful decision to bring Stacy here. You knew what we needed. Thank you. Next is looking ahead. I urge the council to have the city evaluate and remedy the ongoing violations of the lease agreement between the city and SPCA.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have some information about your seats by addressing these violations. The dominoes will fall. The city might not even need or want an operational agreement. Please enforced release before attempting to negotiate an operating agreement on top of a lease agreement that is already being violated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your service to Long Beach. And I also want to appreciate that the words of the voice of confidentiality, because there are some animal advocates in the community who are who are not free to speak because of fear of retaliation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hey, guys. Thank you. Stacy. Stacy Mungo, Janine Peterson, Susie Price for what you've been helping Stacy Dance accomplished this year. It has improved in regards to the SPCA. We are asking our city council mayor not to not to approve the move or any operation agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We already, as you guys said, we already have a legal document that needs to be enforced. And that's really where we need to stand is on the lease. It's a violation of the lease, too, to change door locks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a violation of the lease to not allow our city animals in the shared part of the facility. These things are continually going on and the lease, it's a violation of the lease. So whatever needs to happen to save more lives is really on you guys to make that happen for us, and we keep asking you to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do so. I think it's also disgusting that the Spca's Le's ethics are not being challenged here, that it's unethical for them to have the first pick of puppies or dogs that come into our city shelter over our Long Beach residence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How the hell does that work? I mean, no, that's just the these things that are going on there. It's ridiculous. It doesn't happen anywhere else. And Madeline Brunson needs to be accountable for what she's doing. She is responsible for the deaths of many animals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's got to change in our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also want to echo my thanks to Councilmember Pearce, Price and Margo for your movement. Forward with Compassion Saves. I am more encouraged than I have ever been. Tonight, hearing Susie Price and Stacy Mongo backing very strongly what we all have wanted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you. I want to make it real clear that Mr. Perkins Perkins, we do not have a partnership with SPCA. If you look on page 19 of the book that you were given, it very clearly states in the lease, this is not a partnership, so please make sure you guys review that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Secondly, I also want to concur that I do not support animal you or any kind of agreement until and if all violations committed against the L backs against the shelters by the SPCA, which I have personally seen myself.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was there the day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those animals were tossed out of the small animal room. I saw it with my eyes. That can never, ever happen. Lastly, I'm asking you to hold off on any type of vote or consideration for Part six Chapter 6.04 with regards to the ordinance bringing in animals from other areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is punitive to rescuers who operate and pull many, many animals from the shelter and off of the streets and needs to be strongly reconsidered before it is even looked at by council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Could you please stop the next slide, please? 1/2.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next, guys, please come up to the podium. Candice Lawrence, Carole Peterson, Kristi Mammoliti, Adam R and Fernando Collado.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thank you. Go ahead, Mr.. Could you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I think the record will show me that. I'm embarrassed to say this is the first time I've ever spoken on this issue. This is really nothing more than a 32nd conversation. There should be no killing. Of any dog or a cat.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Figure out how to do it. It should end tonight. Nothing. Nothing should be killed. Figure it out. That's what you're there for. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now, I, too, would like to thank the two, Stacey's and Councilwoman Price, for the work that they've been doing. And it's wonderful to hear that there is some attempt at improving our relationship with SPCA, L.A., which we've all been crying for for years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was brought up to believe that there is no such thing as government money. It's taxpayers money. And I want to know why my taxpayer's money, instead of going to our shelter where we get pleas for kitten food, where we hear that there's no heat and the animals are cold, where there are no spay and vouchers, there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are no spay neuter vouchers available, not even for, God forbid, language, but form where we have our spaying and neutering done. San Pedro. This is insane in a city of our size and our financial acumen. I don't appreciate that my pet taxpayer money is being spent on things like roundabouts landscaped roundabouts that everyone hates and nobody knows'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how to manipulate them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The signage is insane.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've killed practically killed about ten people so far. Not to mention how many people tried to kill me. And it's just not workable. They're in residential neighborhoods and they're not necessary. I'm not interested in my taxpayer money going for rainbow colored walkways.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not interested in my taxpayer money going for bike paths all over the city. I've seen exactly one biker on my street in the 20 years that I've lived on Pacific Avenue. So let's get the priorities here, people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's let's do something for the animals. The big thing that was in that order over and over again, obliquely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, young lady. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Was money. We need money. Hi. So the only menu I would accept is one that grants complete independence from SPCA. I have yet to find any evidence at all backs of the an innovative and life preserving care that was promised in that formation of this public private union years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, SPCA has been a great obstacle in the operations and services provided to animals that backs the thousands upon thousands of animals killed can attest to that. So unless the AMA you give the autonomy to L backs, I would urge you to reject it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At the State of the City address last week, the mayor shared numbers from animal care services. Adoptions were up, euthanasia were down. But these two categories combined represent only a portion of the 5000 plus animals who come into our backs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what happened to the rest? Well, a large number of them went to SPCA, L.A. And then what happened? Nobody knows, because there's no transparency coming from SPCA. The public is kept in the dark as to how many animals it kills and adopts without transparency.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with a CEO who has openly come out against no kill, it makes it kind of hard to trust this society. I would also think twice about regulating the animals coming in to Long Beach to adopt from other places.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The last thing I want is more animals to go to SPCA because I don't know what happens to them. And if we free up cages that SPCA, LA is going to send more over. And of course, this will increase Long Beach's save rate and it will look good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But here's the thing. Not only will we not know what happens to these animals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there will be no incentive for Long Beaches Own Adoption program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. I'm Christine family and it's nice to see you all again this first time I've been here at the new facility. Quite expensive facility. We spent a lot of money. We've spent a lot of time. But the bottom line is that our city's animal shelter is still killing healthy and treatable pets.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Public record requests about those killed have shown this. You've been announcing a great save rate at our city shelter, but that save rate does not include in the numbers that SPCA transfers or kills. We do not know what they do with them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And SPCA is adamant about not being no kill on their website about not. Having no kill around our shelter, hands over up to 25% of the pets. To them, that SPCA is not transparent about what they do with them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'How do we know what that number is? How can we even estimate what our save rate is? When. SPCA. L.A. is a care facility. You cannot even guess. Please stop telling the public how great you think the save rate has become until you get their facts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let's be transparent. Our city shelter needs autonomy from especially in order to function as an adoption facility and SPCA. L.A. is toxic to that end. Let's keep this train moving forward like it is tonight. But no agreements with SPCA, L.A..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. I usually want to start off with a little refresher, and I had needed one for autonomy. Apparently it's in developmental psychology and moral, political and bioethical philosophy. Autonomy is the capacity to make an informed, unconscious decision. And basically what we're trying to get is we want Long Beach Animal Care Services to operate as a separate shelter'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from SPCA. Due to the reasons I addressed earlier, since they're not transparent and we don't not know what happens to our pets once they take them to their facility, they can't be counted as adopted. So therefore it's not what it is meant to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They can't be. If UCLA kills any of them, the same way for Long Beach should represent what they do with our animals. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next, before we get started, can we call up the next slide, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wendy Aragon. Sherry Stamp which. Ronnie Nakano. Diane Cliche. Kate Karp. Would you please come up by the story? Line up by the podium, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Einstein, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. The council members don't agree that we want Long Beach Animal Care Services to offer you a separate shelters from SPCA. Since they do not represent Transparent and we do not know what happens to our pets once they take them to the facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They cannot be counted as adopted at SPCA. They killed any of them. They saved me for long pieces that represent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What they do with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our animals. Thank you. This make Long Beach shelter in Tokyo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wendy Aragon, president of Pain Assistance Foundation. We've helped to spay and neuter many Long Beach pets over.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Over six decades.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have concerns about the proposed changes to the number to the proposed changes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mentioned tonight to the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regarding the number of pets strongly recommend that rabbits be included in the six animals allowed and that they be required to be spay and neuter like dogs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And cats. There's more prolific than cats.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And subject to a lot of abuse. Neglect, abandonment. And we would really like to see this edition. We also in general regarding changes to the ordinance or change the proposed changes tonight, I just want to say that every animal advocate longs for the day when all healthy, adoptable animals find a quality, loving home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, we cannot adopt our way out of the pet overpopulation problem. It exists. We cannot depend simply on the live release rate. Pet overpopulation is a complex social problem and it requires complex solutions. One Increased public education about responsible pet care.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Humane education in our schools. Increase spay and neuter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ms.. Next.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi. First off, thank you for allowing us to speak. So I've never done this before. So it's a little a little intimidating. So anyhow, I run Zaza Cat's Kitty Rescue. We are a street cat rescue based rescue. We save probably about a thousand kitty cats off the streets last year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Probably 80% of them are from the city of Long Beach. And out of that, 80%, probably 80% of them are adopted outside of the city of Long Beach. My fear or whatever is if you put limitations on the adoptable kitty cats we are able to adopt in Long Beach outside of Long Beach, it will actually cause us'",
        "'speaker_9': 'not to be able to save the amount of lives that we do. Say, if all cities were to put an ordinance out there that I'm sorry, but you can't adopt out your Long Beach kitty cats in Whittier, that is going to decrease the amount of cats that we can actually save because we do, like I said, about'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a thousand cats a year. We are on average 500 adoptions a year, just our rescue, not to mention what everybody else here does. So I fully support Stacy and I love what she's doing at the shelter. And I would love to be able to help the shelter out more by saving more animals and by doing so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you tie our hands with where we can and cannot adopt our kitty cats out at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Animal. Hi. I was going to talk about partnerships tonight. Thank you very much, Gerardo, for clarifying. Step number two, because I was very concerned about that. Partnerships, it's become clearer and clearer by what I've heard and what I've seen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That SPCA play, no matter how many animals they take, is not a partner. The ones the ones who are partners are the independent rescuers, like the ones you just saw, Ronnie. They spend their own money and they scramble for more trying to save and adopt out as many pets as they possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we worry that step two is going to affect their ability to rescue, and it'll also isolate them from the rescue community at large outside the city. And as for business, they, with their own rescues, bring business in to the pet stores where they have the rescues on compassion saves and also knows no boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you and I all know that if any of these people find a box of kittens in a dumpster in Rancho Cucamonga or a dog by the freeway ramp, they take it in. And I'll bet. So would any of you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I'm Will. If you can get rid of that. I think it's ridiculous. I think that there's just a small number.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Much. You get it? Okay. Yeah. Hi, I'm Sherry. Say, go to the Sparky in the game. We do adoptions in Long Beach and SEAL Beach. I feel that that putting a pet limit on how many adoptable animals for small groups would really affect us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do save animals from the Long Beach shelter, but unfortunately it's mostly the second injured. And just in the last eight months, we've racked up $28,000 in bills from animals that were not taken by the SPCA, which is very disappointing because when I moved to Long Beach, I was like, wow, we have SPCA here thinking that they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have the funds to take the animals. So we do rescue animals for other shelters that offset the cost of our sick animals here. And we do a huge program of that. I feel like all of the rescue groups here do work together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only group that doesn't work is the SPCA with all of us. I would also like to see that if a dog does get rescued off the street, that the general public gets first pick of the dog, which would which would be called a CTA, which means commitment to adopt so that they can do due diligence of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'rescuing the dog, getting into the shelter, and they get to adopt it from our shelter and collect license fees. And then from that point I would be interested party which would be like rescue groups or anybody else would like the dog and makes it simple, clean and clear where it's not like we're holding this dog for this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'group or that group. They get the dogs out as soon as they're available. They need to go. Also. Okay, I think that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fine. Thank you. Yes. Excuse me. Before the last go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have three more. Mr. Vice Mayor? Yes? Linda montgomery. You please come up to the podium. Luis Montgomery and Jacqueline Case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, honorable council members and vice mayor. I'm the executive director of Fixed Long Beach, so I know most of you and thank you for your past, present and continuing support. Since we have been in action, we've helped to fix over 8000 paths in and around Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So getting there, but not there yet. I would ask that with the 300 adoption pact limit that you include language to say those are pets adopted on city property. We as small rescuers and most people don't know about fix does rescue animals because we have them dumped at our events.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have them left behind. We have picked up animals off the freeway and off the street. And yes, sometimes we do get an easily adoptable animal that is surrendered to us and we can adopt out. But it takes 20 of those to offset one medical case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when we take we have taken a dog from the shelter. We were told it would have a surgery. Money ran out. That dog ended up costing us $3,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So limiting what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're able to do and the pets that we can get and adopt out. It's it's going to be very detrimental to all of the small rescues and it's going to give the SPCA way too much authority, and they're just going to continue doing what they're doing then and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'BOWLIN So please consider that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your time. My name is Louise Montgomery. I'd like to address the increase of pets from 4 to 6. I think it's a great idea. However, the wording, I believe, needs to be for pets to six licensed pets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While volunteering at the city of Long Beach. I personally experience the frustration of the staff and the thousands of hours spent addressing barking dogs, roaming cat complaints from irresponsible citizens who do not supervise their animals. With the mandatory licensing, spay neuter and breeding laws we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's very difficult for animal control to even enforce this. Now, we have very low licensing rates now, and I'd like to council to consider increased funding to address that for the staff of the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name is Linda montgomery. As my sister just said, we do have a lot of dogs in Long Beach that are still not neutered and they're not to go to Dog Beach. A lot of those dogs should be in Speedos.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's crazy. So the city is having a hard enough time enforcing a lot of the rules that we have now and spay and neuter. And also, one of the things that I was concerned about and I was interested in when you showed the chart, was that there are so many dogs that come in in the summertime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the things that may seem irrelevant, but it really is a big deal and there's no transparency on it, is fireworks. The day before 4th of July, they empty out the shelter. A lot of dogs are put to sleep that day because they have to make room for the dogs that are coming in the next'",
        "'speaker_3': 'day because the police are not enforcing our fireworks. And people, if they knew that fireworks harmed as many dogs as that as they do. Maybe if we did a campaign with posters showing that's why we have them illegal, or at least letting people know how many dogs get out, get hit by cars, owners having to go back'",
        "'speaker_3': 'into the shelter to claim their dogs the next day. It's a program that might help with that. So I appreciate your time. Thank you. Hi. My name's Jacqueline Keith. I'm from District eight and I'm also a member of the Animal Task Force as as an alum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as of March 2019, our box has shifted its model from animal control to compassion saves providing animal care and placing greater emphasis on saving healthy and treatable animals and providing life saving programs. So we had an audit back in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so during that, and I'm grateful that you guys are getting more staff, but we still are lacking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The funding programing has expanded to saving healthy and treatable animals remaining in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Open intake and shelter. And yet our budget for 2020 was less than the previous year. So although we've added a new staff member and we're going to add a second one back in 2018, we were told that we need eight additional staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you read the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Audit in 2018, it says in two sections that we need 12 part.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Time, we need eight full time, and then we also need 12 additional. So the problem is, is we're still in I'm grateful for this for this report that you provided being a task force member. Some of the stuff is the first time I'm hearing it, which I'm grateful for.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The people we have, they know I support Stacy and the staff in itself. I also am against the MRU. I think the list stands on itself. We should have more transparency. You should also investigate the fact that why does SPCA have keys to our shelter, our kennels?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why do they take our animals?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the joint documentation for presentation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Much. Because at the bottom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the application, it states that my information is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Advertised with SPCA. And I didn't ask for that. I voted. I wanted a dog or a cat from our shelter. I didn't want to be advertised from them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yeah. And. That is the end of public comment. Now we're going to back behind the diocese.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I have a bunch of things I'm going to try to remember to hit every single thing that came up during that time. It's.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because you already got to speak. I believe it's my turn.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The vice mayor called on me. I don't think the chairs discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Okay. So just to get through a couple of the things that were said in the audience, the budget of animal control has never gone down. What you're looking at in the budget book and I've gone through this with some of you, but obviously I haven't met with all of you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I try to make order as city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Could you clarify the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Process for us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The maker of the motion you had commented before, and then it went to the second year of the motion. Then you went to public comment and then the councilmember appears was cued up next that if you're going in the order, it should be the councilmember from the second district at this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you're free to recue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I understand that's the process. I'm just following the chair's discretion. Does he have discretion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the chair could call on someone else. But that's been your form and your order that's been followed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think it's to me. Well, that's up to Councilwoman Pierce, but I think we're going to get through this no matter how we look at it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I was cued up to second and I was asked to step off of the second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, well, fine. Then you go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't allow it. Okay, good. Thank you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I am excited that we are here today and that we have great leadership coming from both Stacie and Councilmember Price. And so it's it's wonderful to know that that we have many people on this council that today really care about our shelter.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I want to thank all the staff. Thank give them a round of applause. I want to thank our staff, as we already have, not only Stacey Daines, but the staff that's been in the shelter for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I understand that it's about ten years is the average length of stay, length of stay for a staff member in our animal shelter. And I think that that says a lot about how much our staff really care about our animals in that shelter.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm going to try to get through this quickly because I know we've got a long agenda when it comes to the lease in the MCU. I think absolutely. We've already really looked at the lease. We need to continue that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our staff is asking for an IMO you. And from my understanding they're asking for an IMU because and I hate to kind of put it out there, but we have a hostile workplace and between our shelter and the SPCA and so they're asking for an IMO you to really put process into place to hold accountable the things'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that we believe we have laid out in our lease. STAFF Can you answer just a few questions in the lease? Does it lay out how to handle keys, how to handle meeting room request? I, I understand there's meeting spaces that we haven't been able to reserve just how we access pet food.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's a shared space. Does it lay out all of those pieces in the lease?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Those items are not spoken about in the lease.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Right. So it's my understanding that over the last several years that practices have been put into place just as a nobody called that person on it. And so we continue to get ourselves in a hostile work environment. I was there Friday for almost 2 hours and being able to see the space and really understand, understand what the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'shared space was and what our team had access to was really disheartening, not only as somebody who cares about animals, but as somebody that's responsible for our city budget. So my next question is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'When I'm standing in the adoption center, there are beautiful rooms that the little kitty corners, there's additional cages and there's a shared desk in the very back. It's my understanding that there have been times whenever there's been space available, but we haven't been allowed to put our animals in that space.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is that true? It's true. I'm saying I had not. That's true. And it's it's my understanding that on some of the the way that the bills are set up, do we pay the water bill for the entire property?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At this time we are operating expenses are split 5050, including water.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Including split 5050. So and I don't believe that the audit did this. Do we have an assessment of how much space we actually have access to and how much of the resources have been split? My question is getting out, do we have an issue where we're overpaying and maybe there's a government gift?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That we're giving the SPCA that we're not accounting for because we don't have access to the space or we're paying for more water and things that that we don't use. Have we done that analysis?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I don't think that we have taken a look.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At percentages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And square footage and allotment. That's not something that was evaluated in the audit.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. I ask that because I think when we say that the lease is enough, it's really important for us to really consider how much of our city resources are going to support a nonprofit whenever we are not supporting those organizations that really carry the heaviest load.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'As was mentioned here earlier. I support the council comments so far and really making sure that we're putting a lot of teeth to it. I want to make sure, though, that we don't wait to get to the process of of an IMO you because I worry that we might lose staff, we might lose support, we might lose'",
        "'speaker_12': 'funding if that is not a space that is really being shared fully. I love the signs. I love the new logo. I love that when I pulled up at 9:00 on Friday, I saw the staff out there putting up the new signs.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Do we have in our budget for permanent signage? Because I know our logos change and we have the spaces.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a part of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mix that that was. I'm sorry. That was part of the city council approves measure a $450,000. We're going to end up putting new signs. There was a slide there, as well as up to three mighty movers.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And when we talked about the permanent signs, we talked about signage inside the building and we talked about the sign right by the front gate, right above where we walk in. Is that part of the signage as well?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that is something that we're going to be that is our goal and that's something that we have to bring forth in our meetings with, especially because we would have to remove the existing signs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, so I'd like to talk to you about that a little bit. So we've heard very clearly from people in the audience, from our stakeholders and from the council that signage is very important and we completely agree. So we have we do think that's a very good use of measure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are certain signs that the city has for control over anything that is not within the facility, anything that is in the park, anything that is on the sign or on the freeway, on the roads leading up to it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we've identified a number of signs. All of those are going to be switched out. Those will have our brand new lettering. They'll be able to clearly delineate where this where the city shelter is and anything else. Then the lease is very specific.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When it deals with signage inside the facility, it actually says both groups have to agree on signage and then it has provisions on what happens if you if a city can remove a sign that goes up, it is not an agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is not a very good, well, well-written lease. So it's that's part of the reason we're bringing forward operating agreement because we want to make sure that we clarify all this. I think people when they wrote this lease back, you know, 15, 20 years ago, didn't really contemplate the situation that we have today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that is really why we're proposing these types of things. But we clearly want to replace signage. We want to have good, very clear signage. And we're going to make that a priority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. On 1/2. In all fairness for the public, just like we have behind the diocese, your time is up so you can keep back up. Mrs. most will go to you can keep back up to 5 minutes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, just mongo. You have 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I completely agree this is a lease that this council would never approve. And then I'll also comment that often in our current lease agreements, we also approve a lease and an operating agreement at the same time under current.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is that accurate? I feel like I just read a two from four where we're approving a lease and an operating agreement simultaneously. Could you go into that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, that does happen from time to time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Great. So. A couple of things. The shared areas in this operating agreement, I would like to see an effort to utilize. As primary custody. I don't know any other words except for, like, divorce words, but we need primary custody of at least 50% of shared space.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if that means 100% of shared space 50% of the time, or every other Tuesday and every other weekend, whatever you work out. But. Shared again. I have a daughter. I try to teach that it doesn't always end up 5050, but sharing doesn't mean that you keep all the toys all the time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I'd love for there to be some understanding moved towards and the operating agreement that we should see in the next 60 days. I'm willing to work with someone on an animal ordinance for rabbits, but I don't want to hold up where we are today to make modifications on the rabbit side.'",
        "'speaker_10': '50%. Oh, CTAs. I want to talk about CTS. For those of you who aren't in the animal world, I know we have a lot of people here on short term rentals and other things. A commitment to adopt is a very serious thing and we need to have a process by which during the animal hold period for owner'",
        "'speaker_10': 'redemption, that means an animal is lost. It is brought into our shelter. There's an owner redemption period where we don't let other people adopt it out. We need to be able to have a commitment to adopt. And if someone signs up for that commitment to adopt, they have 24 hours from the date of which the animal becomes'",
        "'speaker_10': 'available before we even put it on the docket for SPCA or any other group. Quite honestly, I love our rescues, but the public needs that first opportunity. And where I come from, we have a very strong CTA policy.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're in Chameleon in the Notes section. You can have up to three CTAs. They're all called at the same time when the animal meets that requirement and or they can be present at 10 a.m. on the day that the animal becomes available and whichever one's there first gets to adopt whatever you want to work out that doesn't'",
        "'speaker_10': 'result in fistfights at the shelter. We need that. And there have been fistfights at the shelters around the region over puppies. Budget. Going back to budget, what you're looking at in the budget book is not that their budget has ever been cut.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's that in previous years, as the year goes on, when we know that there's a certain need and Parks and Rec might be able to underspend in an area, they allow animal care to overspend on a one time basis.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the budget from year to year has not gone down. The budget are the things that you have, the ongoing costs of staffing and food and things like that. So I just wanted to be clear on that and then I'll recue for additional comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's. Yes, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman Soprano. I see it. But he was.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Gear. I saw supernovas was up earlier, but I wanted to to ask the question one more time on the signage. So we have it has to be shared and agreed upon inside, but not outside.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We'll have to get you the details. I believe it's the premises that are under the lease. I don't have it in front of me what exact premises they're talking about. But the lease specifically says signage governed under the lease has to be jointly approved.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So when I was there, I saw many doors that were in the shared space that had sparkly names plastered on the doors and said sparkly stuff only in our shared spaces. And it's my understanding we didn't have a process to agree for that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So when we're talking about the menu, I want to make sure that we come back with what is the process that we approve, not only shared space signage, what is the process where we approve meeting space rooms, what's the process for putting our pets into the adoption place but that there is a process and that not one'",
        "'speaker_12': 'person can say no, we might need to use that tomorrow or next day. To is is I wanted to ask what happens if they do not sign the MCU and we find that in the lease there's nothing too egregious because it's not clear enough in the lease.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What happens if she says, no, we're not going to sign that? No, you. I might be a city attorney. Question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As everyone's mentioned, this would be a operating agreement. Operating agreement without an operating agreement or a memorandum of understanding is also an agreement. Right. So they could that is a distinct possibility that the SPC, LA would not execute that agreement and then we would revert back to the existing lease, which is the governing document for the property'",
        "'speaker_12': '. And when when does the word cease and desist come into play? I just had somebody ask and I had to make sure I asked.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it it probably wouldn't come into play with this lease. We probably send them a notice of violation of the lease under the lease and the then they would have a cure period, I believe is 30 days to cure whatever the violation is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if they are inappropriately locking out the city from shared space area, we would send them a notice and they would have 30 days to do that. Prior to doing that, I would hope that the director of Parks and Record and staff would have a conversation with the SPCA to try and resolve that short of involving the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city attorney's office and and enforcing the terms of the lease through the legal process. But that's certainly an option that we have.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Right. I just wanted that kind of mapped out for folks. My last part is around the 300 number. I don't think anybody in the city wants to deter people from rescuing animals. And it's my understanding that this is not saying that you cannot, you know, rescue animals and work with us at the 300 level, but that it's'",
        "'speaker_12': 'more regulating. Can you tease it out just a little bit more on the intent behind that 300 number?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. So in the presentation, you'll note that we are suggesting that the bank's banks team is going to do outreach to the rescue groups as well as to the public about the 300. To be clear, the 300 number is regulating nonprofit organizations that bring 300 animals or more from the outside and Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not adopting Long Beach animals outside of Long Beach. That's not the intent. The intent is to regulate nonprofit organizations that have higher numbers than 300. And we're going to have a discussion with the rescue groups and the public on whether that's the right number before it comes back to you so that it doesn't negatively impact those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rescue groups. And that's that's the intent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Councilmember, I think we would also ask for some flexibility in this ordinance. We would also request and we've seen this in other places where the director of Parks Rec, a marine, can request a waiver of the ordinance under certain circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if there was a rescue group that somehow was at 301 or whatever it is, that if there's a partnership, if things are working well, we're able to say, Yep, absolutely. If things are not working well, we're able to say, I'm sorry, the ordinance does not allow that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we are asking for some flexibility to recognize the effort of those groups that really do do very good work in the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's exactly what I was I was hoping to hear again. Guys, I think you've done a great job, Stacy. I look forward to many years of continuing to improve our shelter with you. So thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Contribution? No.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thanks to PRM for a great presentation. Thanks to all the speakers tonight and special thanks to those of you who reached out to our office prior to tonight's meeting. I was most struck by the comments about some of the behaviors out out at the Animal Care Services Center.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it was touched on here. Hostility in Stacy Mungo just mentioned, fistfights breaking up. I'm reminded of that famous line from the movie Dr. Strangelove. You can't fight in here. This is the war room. If you can't fight in the war room, I don't think you should be able to fight in a room where volunteers are trying'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to help cats and dogs. And I think you're trying to address that by the signage, internal signage within the facility explaining what the rules are. But I think based on one thing that Laura Selma said, that a lot of people are reluctant to come forward for fear of retaliation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think I have a friendly amendment that might address that. And that is I think we could set up, for lack of a better term, a separate portal where reports can be made anonymously as they see the behaviors or see violations that we can have some type of hotline.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if the if the maker of the motion would accept that, that's that's my amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think that would be great. I think having some kind of email address that allows people to anonymously make a report that can be looked into and given the proper timeliness, that would be very much appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if I could we think that's a great suggestion. I'd suggest that we use what we have in place, which is the city auditor's fraud hotline. It is completely anonymous. It has the ability to go directly to the auditor, and then she has a process to forward those things to us for investigation without any attribution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we will work with her on on getting that available if, if that meets the need.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Orson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. I'll be very short. I needed some clarification, first of all, to staff. I want to say a great report and to our our city team, great work just over the last ten years. The numbers speak for themselves.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are definitely headed in the right direction when it comes to euthanasia rates being reduced and adoption rates being increased. And I know that you guys don't share that credit alone. It is as a result of a lot of the great groups that are working in our city to work to make that happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so they are. Congratulations to everybody for the work so far. Thus far, we're not perfect, obviously, but I think we're definitely headed in the right direction. As a result, I wanted to add to the to the it's an emotion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's been a lot said about operating agreement and memorandum of understanding. And I want to get some clarification from city staff on what's the difference.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Legally they're probably no difference. The IMO you is is also a contract. The operating agreement would be a contract. You would have terms and conditions in both of the operating agreement and the IMO you that would hopefully clarify and add to the existing lease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's the intention here. Either one of those documents is capable of doing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And from city perspective, the reason for the change in terminology is just to communicate a little bit better. You know, there was some mistake, there is some confusion about memorandum of understanding. You know, sometimes that term is not well recognized outside of government speak.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So operating agreement is really our way of saying it's supposed to be very clear who does what, how are we going to operate it? The facility was a way to better communicate to the public.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So how long has SBC, L.A. been our partner? Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Since 98 is when the lease was established in 1998.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what were the terms and how are we operating today? How did how do we get to this point? I mean, how has there never been a sit down to agree on how. Dog food is dispensed. And what?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What areas are our city of a Long Beach versus SPCA, L.A.? I mean, has there been none of that whatsoever in the 30 years?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can't speak for the entire 30 years. But during my my being present there, we have been, you know, before Stacy with Ted Stevens, we have been bringing these issues up. And now they have pretty much come to a point where they're now much more serious with regards to changing behavior and ensuring that the the terms of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the existing agreements are enforced. And also more added detail is added to an operating agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And how many years are left on the existing lease agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The lease expires in July 2053.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that tells me that there's going to have to be some some significant work from staff to to work together with all of the stakeholders to try to find a way to co-exist and operate together. Well, I. And so, I mean, I do like I'm going to support what's on the floor here today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm I'm concerned that when, you know, you already have a lease agreement, there's not a whole lot of incentive to come to the table to an agreement if both parties are not willing to get there. Right. And so how we get them there is is is a concern of mine right now and to some of the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'tone around this issue. And to me, there's that there should be more and more collaboration moving forward that with that kind of a tone. So I want to support this. And then my last question is the I know the city auditor did a they did an audit of our animal care services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what authority, if any, does a city auditor have to to look at this lease? But also the the the operations of SPCA. Because it is on city site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that the other could look at the lease and the operations of our partner or speaker in this case under the lease, to see that both sides are operating as they would any other type of lease where we have an agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Queen Mary comes to mind right there. They're looking at the operations of our in that case, of our tenant. In this case, it would be looking at both the city and the SPCA.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or would you be open to a friendly amendment to asking the city auditor also take a look at. The lease as well as the operations of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Fine. So one pair price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just want to go back to my friendly, which was very specific language directing the city attorney's office to review the lease. Note the violations. Seek out weather modification is necessary or termination is warranted. My concern with talking about operating agreements and may use whatever term we want to use is that we currently have an existing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'contract that I'm concerned is not being followed. So what I don't want to do is have us enter into another agreement with someone who might be in violation of the first agreement. So I know Councilmember Mungo accepted my friendly, but I just want to make sure that doesn't get lost here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I get that we're already doing that. But this is a formal request from the Council for the City Attorney's Office to take a look at the lease to provide provide us with information on what violations exist. I will tell you sometimes when we in the past, when we've heard about the relationship there, it has not seemed that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'violations are as prevalent as they might be. And so I don't know if that's because we've had this long term partnership and we're trying to support the partnership. But a partnership, a real partnership only exists when both of the partners are respectfully participating in the partnership with a spirit of trust, mutual respect, all of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think that we have a legal partnership with this entity that should not be clouded by the term of the partnership, but rather by the terms of the lease. So I hope that my friendly was clear that I want to look at the terms of the lease.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can we can talk about operating agreements. But right now, I'm concerned that the first agreement we have in place isn't being followed. So I really hope that that message came through. I felt like I needed to reiterate it one more time because it's been a long conversation, and I'm happy to provide the city attorney with the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'specific language that I read into the record, or I'm sure the video is available to double check that. But that's that. That was my friendly. It was very specific.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Councilmember, thank you for that. If we can get a point of clarification that I understand that you want us to suspend any negotiations on a four operating agreement until that work is done or continue those discussions while we're doing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the second part of that is just the role of the city auditor. So those you know, we welcome the auditor. If there's if there's a role for her and the council wants to do that, it's just to be clear.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What is the attorney doing? What is staff doing and what is the city auditors?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. And I know Councilmember Mungo wants to speak on this, but what where my intent is that is that. The city manager hears very clearly that we're concerned that we have a lease that's not being followed in the manner that it was intended when it was entered upon, that that should be a priority for us to determine'",
        "'speaker_5': 'what provisions of the lease are being violated and to correct those those violations as soon as possible. We should not be entering into a new lease or new agreement. Sorry, not no lease, new agreement with someone who is already in violation of an agreement we have with them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would I think continuing the conversations is great. We can talk all day long, but we shouldn't put pen to paper on any agreement until we've determined.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whether the first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Agreement we have in place is already working or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. That's clear.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So just as a comment to reinforce, I'm responding to the friendly discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So in what you had originally asked in my response, I just wanted to clarify what I had stated. So what I had stated is I received a manila envelope. From no name that had a bunch of potential violations on it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's this does not have to it's from my vanilla folder did not have who it was from. I met with the city attorney, the city manager, and he wrote him what? And in those cases, we went line by line through it was not this thick.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So there may be additional violations in here that were not in the manila envelope provided to my office with no name on it. And we went line by line through every. I don't know, exhortation from the person who provided an anonymous folder of every potential violation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Many of those are in this folder that I received today, and many of them the city attorney looked into. And the statute of limitations has either already passed or they were notified at the time of our meeting. To the to SBC Ala.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they have 30 days to cure. However. In addition to that packet that I provided to the city manager, I'm happy to add any of the materials submitted by the community today to add to that, and I am supportive of the city attorney and the city auditor working together in addition to the in the light of the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'friendly amendment also provided by Councilman Austin. If she's agreeable because she's not here to agree. And I think that that's an important part. If she doesn't have the resources, I don't want to hold it up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Antoine Monger That makes sense that time is up and now we're going to move to Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is that agreeable, Miss Price? Of course. Okay, great. So we're all on the same page.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Pugh.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. And I want to thank Councilmember Price for for clarifying that. I agree and support that. And I just didn't expect I don't expect that that will take too long because we've already been doing that process, which is why I went into the conversation about the operating agreement, because our staff really does need to be supported'",
        "'speaker_12': 'in that process. So my one question that I have two quick things. When the SPCA takes a pet, they come over, they take a pet. We don't know if that pet gets adopted or euthanized. Is that correct? Thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the assumption is that the pet is placed. The SPCA takes animals from us that are extremely highly adoptable and so would not. Have a reason to take an animal that wasn't. There have been times where.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An animal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Maybe falls outside of their adoption program after they have taken it and they have returned it to the shelter.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. I wanted to ask if there was a process for that, just to make sure as we're going through the conversations with process and M.O., you if there was an opportunity to say if you guys take a pet that perhaps you can't adopt, that the first place would be our animal shelter, that it could come back to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'just because I know that that's been a question out there. And then I did want to just clarify, since we're having the conversation today so we don't have to have it again, it looks like in the lease that says any signs are not mutually agreed on, may be removed by the SPCA, by the city at the speaker's'",
        "'speaker_12': 'cost. And so any signs that we just don't agree on? There is a process in that lease. So I just echo that to make sure that we're not you know, we have our signage in the appropriate places so people can adopt from us and that there are signage in other places that might not be appropriate that we'",
        "'speaker_12': 'address that. And the last thing I'll say is that I, again, really proud. And the difference in between ten years ago and today and this is a difficult part, I think, for the SPCA, is that we used to be the facility that euthanized all the animals.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We were animal control. We were not designed to be an adoption facility. And what we're doing right now is we're changing the model to compassion phase. And so it's going to take time to figure out the space in the process and that they really understand that, too.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is that yeah, it might have always operated a different way, but we as a council are setting the tone to say we want to make sure that the city is participating in saving lives instead of euthanizing them. So, again, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's one.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mango. Thank you. I was going through my notes. One of the things I have here is I was contacted by a reporter last week and again today that they've had a public records request in on our animal outcomes for months.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I guess I have a question related to. What is the challenge with running a critical report from Chameleon to get the media the information that they're asking for?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Stacy Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There should be no challenge. If that is happening, I'm I'm going to guess that that is some sort of clerical error. Statistical data is readily available at a moment's notice and can be sent very, very quickly and easily.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it sounds like from talking to a reporter today that in December they requested the number of animals whose animal outcome was transferred to SPCA, and they're still waiting on that. Is there a reason why they cannot have that by Friday?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. There's no reason. Wonderful if you cannot find said public order requests. If you could just email the answer to the council, then we will make sure they get it. Okay. I think that will help. So just to kind of wrap up, thank you to the community for coming.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. For those of you who responded to our Facebook and actually did the sit down dialogs with us in advance of the meeting, I think we got a lot of things handled in advance of the meeting related to potential violations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'For those of you who are scared to come forward and. Put envelopes into my field office mailbox that we read and get everything. And we appreciate you. And I look forward to. If you have any other violations you're concerned about, please email the fraud hotline the city auditor immediately so that those can be handled as a part'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of this process. We'd like to move forward quickly, and we don't want to wait three weeks for more things and more things and more things to come up. And then please also be specific. Make sure that they have dates, make sure that they have the things that are necessary for them to either be notified or cured so'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that we can move forward. Thank you to my colleagues for all the time that all of us have spent in reading the many, many emails and better digging into and understanding. And thank you to my many colleagues who have visited the shelter over the last six months that may have not had another opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'll end with. With relation to the 300 animals. I would really like us to look at a monthly limit versus an annual limit because animals are seasonal and kitten season and all these. If you're talking about 300 animals, maybe you just want to limit it by 25 a month because then during the peak seasons it's easier'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to monitor. And then a rescue that gets an exception is on an exception on a month to month basis. You'll notice that that's something I do in the budget as well. I like monthly limits and I hope that my colleagues are in agreement with that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't hear any objections. So let's look at that to make sure it's a better. Thank you, everyone, for all of your input. And I hope that everyone will support this motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. It's a good package. We had three motions all do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a motion that's been extensively amended and that's on the floor to be voted on at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, could we come up with a vote? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'And before I'd like to make that motion, you know, I like to move forward, like saying that I'd like a motion to amend this item to reflect that the city would be responsible for the property tax as long as the city retains ownership of this building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I hope I can get a second on this motion. Thank you. Thank you very much. With that, you know, is there any public comment? He's no longer. The city owns the property. Yes. Is anybody? Come on. This idea.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You've already done the public comment, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then Mr. Councilwoman. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. I just had a this was the first I heard of it. So I'm just curious what the property taxes are estimated to be for this property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could I get that, please?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh yeah, council members. So at this point, because it's a government owned.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Property there, there hasn't been a property tax assessed. So that's at zero right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as long as we are going through the period of due diligence, there's obviously an early termination period where the city will retain full possession and operation of the site. There will be no property tax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That sounds good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, I would like to add, Mayor, just for clarification, there is a revenue and tax code section that while the city leases the property, the tenant may be responsible possessing any interest tax that the city can't cannot pay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there, there there may be we can work out if there were property taxes do. But on the possessor interest tax, it may be the obligation of the tenant.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the one I think you long as you have ownership of it. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. So I just it was the first that I had heard of that. I've obviously we've worked together for many years, and I don't think that the city does enough for our non-profits. I just want to make sure that we are all clear on on how much that is and looking at opportunities to support other non-profits as'",
        "'speaker_12': 'we go down the road. But I support this item and support that change. If staff could give us a two from four on what those expected costs will be over the next 510 years. I'd be great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's progress. That's right. Yes, right. Okay. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And Councilman the dance. Did you go? Oh, okay. I guess I'm confused. Possessive. Your interest is determined by the auditor comptroller and the Treasury tax collector and the county assessor. And so I. I don't know that I'm comfortable asking our city staff, but if you'd like me to connect you with the person that does that, there's actually'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a division of the assessor that I can connect you with and they can give you those estimates. But the estimates are based on several factors that are kind of outside the city's control. So you have my cell phone number.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Call me tomorrow and I'm happy to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We weren't aware of that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So because that's the interest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tax rate that somebody who's leasing the properties still get taxed on leasing a property. Correct. Okay. So we didn't.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Wait, let me connect you with the assessor's office, and they can explain the specifics that you would need to know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're looking to get a note from the assessor's office and not from the city department in the name of Cent, their charge for those taxes. Is that what we're.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Expecting to get?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm not sure what you expecting to get, but I can definitely connect you with the people that can help you figure bargains.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you some clarification on this, please?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I believe the the draft lease has the language in it that talks about the tenants responsibility for the possession interest tax, which is required under the revenue and tax code to be in there when we're leasing property, city owned property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then but I'm not sure at what time you would exercise your option or how this is going to work. But the possessor interest tax is the responsibility of the tenant at this time. I hear what the vice mayor is is recommending is that we somehow switch that liability to the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Until.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we'd have to have further negotiations on maybe the value of that is some sort of a rent credit or something. But I don't think you can they can't just pay the possessor interest tax on behalf of the tenant benefits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Yeah. So we're, we would definitely have to have more information about that, I think. My understanding it's where it's the way it's structured. So I think there is opportunity to negotiate on that. And so maybe it's part of our community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But my understanding is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's the way it's structured. So, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what motion you will that give them time to get more information and we could. Okay. So is that okay with you?'",

    "Ordinance on Short-Term Rentals Regulation.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we're going to move to item 23.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Item 23 is a report from Development Services recommendation to declare ordnance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to short term rentals. Read the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading and adopt a resolution to submit the ordinance amendments to the California Coastal Commission citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why could we? Are we ready? Okay, fine. Kind of spend quiet to please.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. Thank you. I would. So I'm the crazy lady that brought forward this item several years back. And the intense with bringing this item forward at that time was really to make sure that the city was being proactive and thoughtful about how short term rentals operated in our city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We know that we do have a housing crisis. We know that we are also a city, that tourism is growing. And we find ourselves really trying to make sure that we create a policy that is thoughtful and mindful of both of these.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Tonight, I know that there's going to be a lot of discussion behind the dias. I would like to hear from staff a clear report. I'd like to hear from community members. And I've got several motions that we'll be talking about back here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Some of the key items for me are making sure that we find the right number, making sure that we have enforcement that has teeth. Making sure that we have requirements on the platforms and that there's a process in place.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So with that, I'd like to hear from staff and yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Yes, we do have a fairly detailed staff report. As you have laid out. This has been a long process with a lot of community outreach and we had very well-attended community meetings with many engaged people on both sides of the issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have also we were at the council in 2019 and and really walk through a lot of the details that were coming out of that community process and got direction from council to basically come back with the ordinance and do all the environmental work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we brought that back to you in December, at which point the council asked us to do take a little bit more time, and that's why we're here tonight. And so with this, I will turn over the presentation to our Development Services Department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The presentation will be led by Charles Staver from Development Services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, members of council. This brief presentation is to highlight some of the key elements of the draft ordinance. Since our last discussion. Or some background. In 2017, the City Council requested a review of STR regulations and other municipalities and staff provided initial feedback and recommended hiring a consultant to do more thorough study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In 2017, we held several community outreach events and conducted an online survey. Did some case study research and presented our findings and recommendations for an ordinance which would allow for limited staffers in Long Beach. Following that discussion in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staff provided additional research on several topics at the request of council, developed a phased implementation plan, executed a voluntary tax collection agreement with Airbnb, prepared and circulated the secret documentation, met with host platforms and housing advocates, and ultimately drafted an ordinance regulating short term rentals for your consideration tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So here is a high level look at some of the key elements of the ordinance. It establishes a revocable city registration process, protects the housing stock by limiting the number of staffers citywide to 1% of housing stock promotes partnerships between the city and hosting platforms, improves safety, fosters good neighbor environments, and a registered store operator is allowed'",
        "'speaker_6': 'up to two non primary residence staffers with no limit on Unhosted stays and is also allowed up to 90 days. Unhosted stays in a primary residence. So a primary residence STR is defined as the unit where the host resides at least 275 nights per year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And during that time any guest stays are considered hosted and there is no limit on hosted stays that would only leave 90 days per year in which that unit would be unhosted. Now, since permanent Long Beach residency is not required to operate an str, an operator is not required to host in their primary residence and may choose'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to operate only a non primary residence. STR It's important to note that this slide represents the maximum number of stars allowed per operator, but the majority of STR operators in Long Beach actually only operate one unit. So just as an example, if I live in Long Beach for six months of the year and wanted to rent that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'unit the remaining six months as a short term rental unhosted that would be allowed as a non primary residence str. Now this slide show is what we had intended to accomplish with the ordinance by allowing stores and accessory dwelling units, which was in line with the majority of community feedback.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But before we get too attached. Effective January 1st, 2020. New State Law Assembly bills 68 and 81 prohibit short term rentals and accessory dwelling units. So this is new information to us. This is our new reality. This law does not affect duplexes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in this slide, as an example, if the operator resides in either one of the duplex units, which would be the bottom right, they would still be able to operate the other unit as an STR. So for multifamily developments, the number of units that can be operated as a non primary residence star has been limited to avoid'",
        "'speaker_6': 'situations like ghost hotels, where entire apartment buildings essentially become de facto hotels. So for example, in a multi-family dwelling unit with 2 to 10 units, the city would allow up to one non primary residence STR or 11 to 50 units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We would allow up to 10% or 51 to 100 units. We would allow up to 12%. And for 101 or more units, the city would allow up to 15% of the units to be operated as a non primary str.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And also an apartment owner or homeowners association can notify the city that stars are not allowed in their buildings. And in that situation, the city would not approve any SDR registrations in that development. So this screen is just a visual representation of the previous slide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The darker blue units would be representing the non primary units that we would allow as short term rentals. Petition to prohibit Unhosted staffers throughout the community outreach process. There was a push for including some sort of neighborhood based opt out process to prohibit Unhosted staffers in certain neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Although this is not a common provision in other cities, some Long Beach residents presented compelling arguments for including this option. The way it would work is at least two thirds of the property owners must sign a petition to prohibit Unhosted stays.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If approved, the city would provide notice of a restriction to all residential property owners in the affected census tract, and the restriction would remain, in effect uncontested for the first three years, at which point the restriction could be lifted by a similar two thirds petition process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'City registration and annual fee will be required. A city issued registration number valid for one year would be renewed on an annual basis. The city registration number must be included in all advertisements and listings, and a citywide registration cap of 1% of the city's housing stock would be allowed as non primary residence staffers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The size of the city's housing stock is based on demographic reports posted on the California Department of Finance website and updated annually. As of January 2019. The housing stock of Long Beach was 177,378 housing units. So the city would only issue STR registrations for up to 773 units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In September of 2019, the registration fee was set at $250 per registration per year for the current fiscal year. Here are a list of some basic regulations, such as the transient occupancy tax applies. Occupancy will be limited to two guests per bedroom, plus two with a maximum of ten staffers will be prohibited and restricted affordable housing units'",
        "'speaker_6': ', dormitories and 80 youths. A landlord consent form required if unit is subject to a rental agreement. SDR limited event permit. This would be a new permit for the city. It would allow hosts to accommodate guests in excess of the ten person maximum for up to 624 hour periods per year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Most would be required to notify all neighbors ten days in advance of the events and outdoor quiet hours from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. would still apply. Lessons learned from other cities and municipalities that have established STR regulations is that in order for the program to be successful, you really do need the cooperation of the hosting platforms'",
        "'speaker_6': ', particularly for removing listings that have not registered or have had their registrations revoked. So the hosting platform responsibilities include hosting platforms cannot complete any booking transactions for an STR if notified by the city that a valid ACR registration number has not been issued to the operator.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Platforms shall remove any listings upon notification from the city and the requirement to provide some pretty basic information on their bookings reported on a monthly basis. In addition to working with the hosting platforms, enforcement of the regulations is key to a successful program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Violations will be subject to a $1,000 fine per day, except a 30 day warning period would be provided for advertising a store without a valid registration upon issuance of three fines, the ACR registration may be revoked. Violations include, but are not limited to failure of the local contact to take action to a complaint within one hour.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Completing a booking transaction without a valid, valid city issued registration number. Violations of STR maximum occupancy conduct or activity that constitute a public nuisance. And the ordinance also establishes a mechanism to revoke registrations of individual bad actors. These are some common themes we've been hearing lately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The residents continue to voice concerns over party houses, and the way this ordinance addresses that is establishing the maximum occupancy restriction and the creation of the new STR limited event permit, property owner and consent and liability. The verification of property owner consent would be dealt with in an administrative process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Part of the implementation program and some hosting platforms have expressed resistance to data sharing language in the ordinance, and we believe that the language is consistent with the recent court rulings and stand by it. And some requested language changes to strengthen platform accountability.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Kind of the opposite of the previous one. And thus we believe that the existing language is legally robust and they recommend leaving it. To operate within the adopted fiscal year, 20 budget staff was tasked with developing a delayed or phased implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That plan looks like this. The ordinance takes effect 181 days after adoption, and the initial registration period begins then during the 181 day program. Program materials will be developed and enforcement begins 180 days after the initial registration period and one year after enforcement begins.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staff will report back to council with data on program operations, and at that time we can make changes as needed. So next steps pending council decision tonight would be to adopt an ordinance amending Title 21 of the Limited Municipal Code segment, the local Coastal Program Amendments to California Coastal Commission for approval.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Develop implementation guidelines with input from stakeholders. This concludes our presentation. We are happy to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mrs. Janine. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I've already said what I want to say before public comment, but I think I'm somewhat surprised that you want to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Make any comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure, I'm anxious to hear from the public tonight as well. I represent, obviously part of the city that is a very popular area for home sharing platforms and home sharing opportunities. And so I know I have a lot of residents here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You don't all have to speak. I want you. You're welcome to. But can I? Can the third district residents stand up so we can get a sense of who's here from the third district? Okay. So let me just tell you that in the six years I've been on council, I've never had this many residents be interested in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'coming to a council meeting. So thank you for being here. You may be seated, but I do want to share that as a result of the input you all have provided me on all aspects of this issue, I have some concerns regarding scars.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I raised those initially, and I'm grateful that staff was able to incorporate some of the amendments that I proposed originally when this came forth. And I expect that in collaboration with my colleague, Council Member Pearce will be able to hopefully get to a place where quality of life impacts housing stock and the ability to home share are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'all viewed in the totality and we come to a resolution that will hopefully meet our goals and needs with all of those categories.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when I remove the sign, we have over 80 speakers. So we're going to kind of cut this down to one minute if it's okay with my colleagues. One minute, please. You know my colleagues. 30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could we do that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Can we do 90 for the first ten? Just a minute is hard. Let's just very technically ask.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's vote on it. You guys want to do a minute? I would. Please raise your hand. I do want to do a minute. Okay. Yeah. One, two, three, four. But l. Minute or three.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It was proposing 90 seconds for the first ten and a minute after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I asked one how many would like to do? One minute, please raise your hand. One, two, three, four, five. Okay, we have a majority vote. So now would you please call the names?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have the first five line up at the podium. When coming up to the podium, please state your name for the record. Jeremy Arnold Tung. Q. Jeremy and as Jim Samuel and Victor Sanchez. Jeremy Arnell. Thank you, Jerry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as Jim Samuel and Victor Sanchez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Jeremy Arnold, Unitarian Universalist Church member and resident of District one. There are many problems with the ordinance as proposed as it's as I see it, and it's sort of hard to know where to begin. But I'm here to express a deep commitment to a 500 unit cap is incredibly important if we're going to protect our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'affordable housing stock here in Long Beach. And with 30 seconds left, I'd just like to to offer, you know, the example of New Orleans, where I lived before I moved here to Long Beach rules that they went into effect on December 1st, limited short term rentals in residential areas to owner occupied properties only in place, caps on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rentals in commercial and mixed use buildings and a ban them outright in most of the French Quarter in the entire Garden District. So Long Beach and we should be leading on responsible tourism. It should be leading on housing.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And if you find yourself by yourself, I want you have say I said one minute, you have 54 seconds. You can leave that other to someone else, except you can yell or swim in 3 seconds to someone else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. My name is Janice and I've been a resident of Long Beach in the third district for over 30 years. And I support the short term rentals and the vacation rentals in this whole process that we've taken to get to this point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I've read the proposed ordinance in detail, and I would like to make one point that I'm strongly against the opt out ban through census tract petition process. I think it's a very challenging to enforce and it pits neighbors against each other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then I would submit, where do you stop that? Other ordinances could then say, I don't like this, let's do this. And then you've got the community itself ruling instead of the council in the mayor. And so with that, thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Host owner, I oppose the opt out provision as it pits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neighbors against neighbors. People living in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A particular sense of track should not have the ability to regulate other homeowners. Sharing my property as a short term rental will bring more tax dollars to the city. This is with the transit resident occupancy tax people spending money in local restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Businesses and entertainment venues such as the Queen Mary Cream of the Pacific. Just to name a few. Please vote no on the opt out portion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Victor Sanchez of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in a Healthy Community. This item, if it's voted the way that it is, it would put financial interests of short term rentals over that of long term tenants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we urge you not to do that. I want to focus on three things. One, the total units a host should be able to put on to the short term rental side should be no more than two one primary, one non primary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's hard to believe that someone who owns three properties will still need to make additional income on the side to make ends meet, especially when they can have long term tenants in those units and still make a fair return.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Two We need to have a hard cap of 500 for non primary units. Non primary units are what impact the housing market. Most in percentage is dangerous because it legislates an annual increase. If we assume that the city of Long Beach will build more housing, which it must.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And three we want a reasonable and accessible opt out mechanism for neighborhoods. 50% plus one to property owners in a given census tract is reasonable when you take into consideration the thousands of property owners that exist in one census tract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if a community wants to change that in 2 to 3 years, they should be able to because there should also be a 180 day rolling petitioning period. Please do not vote to cannibalize existing housing stock, especially after we voted down a bond that would have built more affordable housing here in the city of one.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'In April of last year, we entered into a tax collection agreement, and in the short eight months since that agreement took effect, we have remitted to nearly $2 million in new taxes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Is it possible, Mr. Vice Mayor, that we can ask the audience to be respectful of all speakers? I don't appreciate the hissing. Everyone deserves a right to speak here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Could you guys please follow those lines of what is, of course, out of total respect? Please, you guys. We asked you back. Thank you. Go ahead. So you have another minute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. So, as of April 2019, we have remitted in the eight months since through November of last year, we have remitted nearly $2 million in new taxes to the city of Long Beach, which can be used for incredibly important public services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our model is also something that empowers local Long Beach residents. Hosts keep 97% of the proceeds and the 93% of our hosts direct guests that visit Long Beach to local small businesses helping to grow that tax base as well.'",

Today, our region is at a crucial turning point that will either see the increasing numbers of residents priced out of their'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Second of all, neighborhoods should be allowed to opt out at a 50 plus one amount. And third. This is not about sharing primary residences. This is about corporations who are buying up Long Beach housing and hurting our housing stock.'",

We have to support the right of homeowners to make a reasonable profit from their owner occupied properties, but prevent large scale conversion of commercial rental properties to residential units.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Protect our neighborhoods from becoming destinations for tourists who have no investment in our community culture. And I would like to say that. Remember how much you hesitated to even consider. A bond to provide affordable housing. Two weeks ago.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Not exactly, not what we were looking for, but we would like to have the flexibility to do either long term or short term rentals. I hear the good arguments about housing stock. You have a reasonable protection in the bill that I heard that I heard earlier against the corporate mass ownership.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's good. I and essentially, I think a reasonable STR ordinance that allows a peer to peer economy, such as we see in cars and in the gig economy and jobs, is important. Thank you. I'm doing. Can I get those 30 seconds on?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is that. I came from a sixth district resident. I grew up in 90806 zip code where the average income is $20,000. The needs of my community are much different than 90803, where the average income is over $120,000.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I think for areas such as mine, there should be some kind of means cap, there should be some kind of median income cap so that if the area is has a certain lower income, then there should be a shorter amount of rentals available for for starters, an issue that I have is that I think that maybe there's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm okay with people renting out the duplex of their home, their primary home. But I think it's a bit excessive to have so many extra properties to be doing the short term rentals. So I hope this is made stronger.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We heard the speaker tonight talking about over 1500 units taken off the market by Airbnb right now. This is unacceptable. And people are sleeping on the streets right outside of this building in our parks, around the community. I understand that people have investments tied up in this, but honestly, I don't care.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Long Beach is in a housing and homelessness crisis. Two weeks ago, this council failed to act to end homelessness with homes through a local affordable housing funding measure. Tonight, Council once again has the opportunity to act to alleviate the housing crisis and prevent the loss of long term housing units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Don't waste this opportunity to do the right thing. Specifically, we're asking for three things. First, two total units, one primary, one non primary. Don't put profit over people, especially when corporate property owners are buying properties for the sole purpose of placing them on short term rental sites.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second, a hard cap of five 500 non primary units city wide. Any more than that short term units will any more short term units than that will diminish our housing stock every single year and push vulnerable families out of their homes and onto the streets.'",

So we've had three years of public meetings and workshops and what have we found out that people overwhelmingly are supportive of long term residents gaining a little extra income by hosting guests as long as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there are rules and the host is responsible. So no optional ban on Unhosted staffers through the petition process. 99.9 99% of hosts are responsible citizens. They care about their properties, hosting help seniors pay property taxes to stay in the neighborhoods they love.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it helps millennials get their foot in the door to afford their first property. So noise and nuisance complaints.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach is behind on our affordable housing goals. We need to focus on creating more affordable housing instead of allowing our housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Stock to disappear to short term rentals. Most short term rentals in Long Beach are unhosted or entire homes. This is not home sharing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This depletes our housing stock and puts pressure on tenants already.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vulnerable to a tough rental market.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The ordinance, as drafted, allows for one host to have up to.'",

        "'speaker_1': '2 total units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is a fair compromise. Community members should also have an option to determine whether or not they want a short term rental in their neighborhood. Many of us signed a lease or bought property to live in a home with other members of our community, not to live next to a near legal de facto hotel and facing additional hardships'",

Short Term Rental Alliance. Tonight, I speak on behalf of our members to say that we stand in support of short term rental stakeholders in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know from our experiences that short term rentals provide tourism revenue deep, deeper into our local neighborhoods. Every neighborhood should be allowed the opportunity to have short term rentals in their neighborhood. I personally have offered short term rental stays in Huntington Beach since 2015.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of these stays were from relatives of my neighbors. It seems that grandparents want to stay within walking distance of their children and grandchildren. Every neighborhood in Long Beach should have the opportunity to have short term rentals in their neighborhood.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Hello. My name is Josie. So I am here on behalf of Unite Here Local 11. The incorporation of certain short term rentals ordinance for our city must be done with intention, caution and scrutiny. Government policies around short term rentals should not take.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry, I should not make it easy for people from outside our community to come to Long Beach, take affordable housing away from the workers in Long Beach and rent it to tourists just passing through. We are limiting the amount of houses people have, leaving many people homeless.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I urge Council to consider the well-documented impacts of short term rentals have on workers in our city and adopt an ordinance that softens the impact of short term rentals than it has on our families and our cities and our workers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I carelessly here. I want to speak in terms of if you do pass this tonight, I would like to see very active code enforcement and a kind of a three strikes law. If an Airbnb has a location that violates the ordinance three times, they should lose their license.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Secondly, if when I've looked at the pros and cons on this, it does bring business into the city and offers homeowners and property owners additional funds. It brings them there to tax. But on the negative side, removing housing from the rental market frightens me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With the state legislation that's coming forward and demanding additional housing out of us. So I'm more on the pros and cons side than the pro side. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. And Cantrell. I remember when this was Granny.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Flats and this sounded reasonable. Put a little house on your property and let Granny live there. And then it became an Airbnb. Rent it out so you can get a little extra money. But the original law that you passed said the owner had to live on the property.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now you're allowing an owner of three properties and he only has to be on one of them, not a 90 days of the year. As I understand it, he doesn't even have to be there at all. The purpose of having someone on the property is to be able to make sure the noise element is is followed because'",

The proposed ordinance as drafted is a lose lose proposition for the residents of Long Beach, causing neighborhood degradation and is acknowledged in the staff report severe adverse consequences and the availability of affordable housing. One of the most troubling items is the proposal to allow investors to buy multiple properties to operate as short term'",
        "'speaker_3': 'rentals 365 days a year in effect, and operating unregulated hotels anywhere in our city. The problems are compounded by the unprecedented and frankly, stunning provision that would allow large scale parties and events at these homes and residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No other town in California does such. Even more troubling is that every one of the investor owned short term rental properties would otherwise be available as long term rentals to local residents. This Council should also be aware that the proposed ordinance is in sharp contrast to the rules adopted in most other California cities, which prohibit or restrict'",
        "'speaker_3': 'non owner occupied short term rentals. I urge the Council to have the opportunity to review those rules as well as the impact on housing before making ruling here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Council Members. Ellen Crawford. I support Sharon housing the housing hosted chair, but strongly oppose the ordinance as written. With this ordinance we are flying in the face of what our neighboring communities are doing. In contrast to what the woman up here is saying, stars are banned in Huntington Beach and stars are banned in SEAL Beach'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Stars are severely limited in Santa monica and stars are banned in Manhattan Beach. I have an example from Laguna Beach on. Just read you really quickly. This is what Laguna Beach said three months ago. Visitors who can escalate the demand for city services create adverse impacts in residential areas.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Good evening, city council members. My name is Johanna Cunningham and I'm the CEO for the National Short Term Rental. I am here to speak against the opt out provision. I do believe that it does pit neighbor against neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We already have that coming forward. I am a little confused, though. I do have to say that I don't see short term rentals being the word short term, taking off housing for long term residents. Many of the owners that I know are providing short term.'",

Nearly two thirds opposed the regions. They opposed as the we are a densely packed community with as little as six feet between houses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We leave our windows open and noise from rooftop decks carries and creates an adverse quality of life. We are also a parking impacted neighborhood and when SDR renters come in and bring two or three cars with them, it simply exacerbates a problem that we live with every day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's doubled in the summer. I think allowing the neighborhood to exercise the opt out provision and restrict operations to those that are hosted is very important.

        "'speaker_12': 'is really to protect housing but have a Long Beach model. And so one thing I do want to remind folks is a lot of the people that spoke tonight talked about what it meant for them to have their own unit.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The Long Beach ordinance, as written right now, allows for unlimited nights for a primary resident. And that's something that a lot of cities don't have. And so I want to applaud the council for really seeing that that hosts that live in our communities are our neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And we've got to know a lot of them. A lot of them are seniors or people that are maybe taking care of somebody in their home and that the city has done something that other cities haven't done. And so I wanted to keep that in the back of everyone's mind.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Staff I'm going to ask some questions, if you could try to answer them kind of quickly just because it takes up my time too. Why were business licenses removed from the requirement? Killing me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This license removed from the requirement because of the small number of units that we are going to allow SDR operators to operate. Currently, people that do rentals, it starts at four units, so it would have to go back to the voters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. That.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And there was a residency requirement for additional units and that has been removed as well. Can you explain that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I'll take that one. The reason we removed that is we didn't feel it would could withstand a legal challenge because they are property owners, whether they live in the city or not, so that they pay taxes like the property owners that do live in the city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we felt that would be not fair.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. And the reason I ask that question, because when we had this item in front of us last time, we had said that we wanted you to be a property owner in the city of Long Beach to be able to have an additional unit that wasn't your primary.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Now that that's not true, I think that that has an effect on where we end up as a council with the number of non primary. I don't know what that number is yet. But I just wanted to point that out for the council that that at least was where I was at last time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There seems to be some misunderstanding on requirement of what? Is it a requirement that everybody pay to yacht to the city or only those that are entered into an agreement with the city?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Everybody is required to pay if the ordinance passes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, great. And for those people that might not put their short term rental on a platform like Airbnb or Expedia, how do we expect that we'll collect that Totti?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, typically through an enforcement process, it's generally fairly easy to find out who is renting properties on a short term basis. And when we found that out, if it wasn't on a platform, we'd track that down, go after the person to collect it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It'd be an enforcement process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Could the city, you know, if we can turn to an agreement with with platforms, could the city, say, encourage everybody that doesn't start in the city to listen on a certified platform?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We'd have to do a little bit more research on that and see what other cities are doing. I think we probably could do something like that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Seems like it's for the platforms that are working with us and providing us with Totti and as was mentioned, one point something million already this year seems like it would save staff time. A lot of process. If we require those stars to be on any platform.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I don't care which platform but one that we know we're collecting Totti from. So I look forward to maybe hearing some more about that down the road. Getting to the issue of, let's see, of the number in the caps.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So one thing that I think was also missed from the last time when we had this discussion was my intention with making sure that we weren't putting additional short term rental units on the market. If our housing stock was not healthy.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And what's known as a healthy housing stock is that we've got about 8% housing vacancy. Two years ago, I think the vacancy was a much lower number. The staff have an idea of what our housing vacancy number is now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's roughly six and a half percent, 6.7%.'",
        "'speaker_12': '7%. And the reason why that that's important is because we know when the housing market gets crunched that rents can go up. And we have what happened in 2017, which was a big turnover.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me, that. Yes, you can cue back up if you like to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Look at 17 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now the second year of the motion. Can I yield 2 minutes, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I'm just looking at those two rows. I see.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So the screen up there and the screen over here is different. So this one still says, I've got 30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, you got 30 seconds, got 30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_12': '2 minutes and 30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You don't have to use the whole 2 minutes. I can use that, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, my gosh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. So I wanted to have a little bit of that context. I will have some other things to mention. I'm not sure if I can read all my changes and in 2 minutes all my motions, but I will begin.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Was I done? I'm like, I guess the one other part I wanted to mention was not only our housing vacancy, but the where our hotels are at. And so I appreciate that the hotels who love me so much are here advocating for something tonight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But from my conversations with the CVB, this morning is on any weekend that we have something big like the Grand Prix, we're at 100% capacity. And so I wanted to ask if down the road not tonight, but if down the road there could be some conversations around increasing whatever number we come up with tonight for a very'",
        "'speaker_12': ', very, very special event so that we're not losing out on top, but an opportunity that might arise. And I don't know what that is yet, but I, I wanted to ask Steph if that was an option for you to explore.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Down the road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can certainly investigate that. Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I have 2 minutes. With all of that said, very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have some extra minutes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, I'll stop them. I'm going to let Suzy talk, and we'll go from there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm going to I'm going to keep it simple because I know everyone on the council probably wants to add something to this. First of all, thanks for everyone. Thanks to everyone who came out. It is indeed a very unique collaboration effort, and I'm pleased to see it because we honestly don't see that enough.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The biggest concern for me is that short term rentals have been the Wild West in the city for a long time, and they're illegal and it's impossible to enforce them because the residents have to be the the evidence gatherers that's putting neighbors against each other.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. They're out there taking photos of violations and things and it's very difficult to enforce it. So for me, whatever provisions we come up with tonight and I'm going to queue up again. We need to have a strong enforcement mechanism because if we don't have a strong enforcement mechanism, it doesn't matter what rules we come up with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'here. We can come up with rules all day long, but if we're not enforcing them, then, then that's a problem. The number one concern that I've heard from my residents is your vacation rental unhosted non primary residence that's being rented out all year long and there's no vested interest by the property owner to care for the use'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and enjoyment of the property of their neighbors. And so to me, that's what we want to limit, and that's where the opt out for me makes sense. What I'd like to do is right now the proposed opt out in the provision is two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thirds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of voters in the census tract. I'd like to reduce that to 50% plus one. However, however, I would like to ensure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That the people who are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Circulating the petitions are property owners. Because what I don't want is petition gatherers to be paid to infiltrate neighborhoods, to get them to get the number of signatures they need for the petitions, because I don't think that's going to help your use and enjoyment of your neighborhood either.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if it's and I want the city clerk to be involved in determining who the signature gatherers are, who's petitioning to ensure that their property owners in that census track. So that's very, very important to me. That's that's my number one concern in regards to what my residents have reached out to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm in favor right now as the ordinance is currently written. It allows for somewhere around 1700 of these vacation rentals in the city of Long Beach. I think that number is absurd. I'd like to limit that number. I want to hear from my colleagues on what they think that number should be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think 1700 at this time is absurd. So I'd like to hear from my colleagues on what they think about that. The other thing that I want to talk about is on the prohibition option. So multifamily units, buildings where the property owner gets on the prohibition list, they don't want their tenants to sublet and serve as'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a short term rental, while the property owner should not be fined if the platform is posting that location as an as a site to be rented when they're on the city's prohibition list. So I really want to work on what we can do about that if the property owner is doing everything they can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. You can queue up again. So Mango.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I want to appreciate everyone who came down tonight. I know not all of you have come to a city council meeting before, so you should know that we've imposed rules upon ourselves to limit ourselves to 5 minutes and then recue for the same reason that we want to hear all of you, which is why we'",
        "'speaker_10': 'reduced down to one minute so everyone could stay in here, everyone's opinions and the final vote. I think it is absolutely absurd to use a census track as the determining factor. I spoke against this at the last meeting.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some census tracts have a couple hundred people in it. Other census tracts have 3800 homes. And it would be absolutely impossible for a community that is made up of I'm sorry, a census track that is made up of multiple neighborhoods that have completely different vibes and feels to be the determinant of your ability to have a piece'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of housing which is across a major street away. I mean, literally, some of these housing tracts go across Studebaker. It's ridiculous. So I pulled an example. My neighbor who lives on Val Verde just moved to Naples. And so I pulled up an example.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So. Naples is housing track 5775.01. It is consistent of 1788 homes in that housing track. Of that 1788 homes, the voter district that overlays which remember there can be 1 to 3 voters in a household. Makes up two housing tracts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm sorry, two census tracts. And there are only 1200 registered voters. I mean, so your barrier to actually banning a as a bad landlord is very difficult. So I would like to have a discussion around is it the 300 homes closest to the short term rental or something like that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We kind of talked about it at the last meeting. I drew pictures for development services about my opinion and why, and I asked questions in advance to get this housing census tract. But I don't know that anyone here would think it's reasonable to gather signatures from.'",
        "'speaker_10': '1000. It's almost 2000 households to ban a house. And on top of that, I don't know about you, but when I was running for office, there may be two yard signs, two people running for mayor in the same household.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if you only get one vote per household and your vote is split, how does that even work? I just don't think the process is well thought out. And so for that reason, I'm I petition slide eight. Also, we've requested numerous times that all the slides are numbered so people can follow along and, and follow up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if we could just make sure that that happens. So slide eight. I just I can't agree to census tracts. It seems unreasonable. And Cantrell, you said give it to the third district. Don't give it to me. Your census tract has 864 homes in it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's no way, you know, half of those people or that they would know if your neighbor was a bad landlord. I have concerns about tenants forging paperwork to use their rental property as an Airbnb. So if I'm a landlord and I have a tenant and that tenant wants to use it as an Airbnb, I would love to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'have some kind of mechanism where a landlord can just mail in somewhere and say, I don't want any of my units ever to be available as an Airbnb so that if their tenant wants to violate the rules, there's some kind of barrier to forging documentation and so on, because that has happened extensively from what I hear.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I love the idea of a incentive for weekends that are Grand Prix or certain conferences that sell out the whole city. Heck, my husband and I might leave and go stay in Carson for a week when the Olympics is here and rent out our house for some exorbitant amount of money and pay our mortgage for a couple'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of weeks so that our kid can be in swim lessons or whatever she wants to be. And so something like that I think is amazing idea. The last thing I want to say is we talk about limiting the number to 1700.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Without a legitimate process in place. There are 1300 in the city. So if we wanted to limit the number by housing track, I could see something like that where you're not overpopulated in any particular community, but I would prefer it be my neighborhood and not my housing track because I don't believe people across the major street have'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the same feel and lifestyle as others. Thank you. And I yield my 47 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mrs. Index.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, colleagues. This is a very, very important subject. And yes, thank.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You to everyone who.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has come out here in support. And and, you know, just being here makes a big difference. It's a very difficult decision for us upon the dias to make a decision this big just by ourselves. So please know that your participation tonight and reaching out to all of our offices is very important because we really want to do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you justice. With that being said, I, I just feel that, you know, the 1% is outrageous. It's too to way too much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Enforce something like this. I think that, you know, being from a district where affordable housing is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Impacted in a big way, I think that, you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Know, one thing that I would like to do is actually make an amendment to the motion. I want to make sure that that we don't overdo it and be and that. Sorry about that. And I want to make my amendment so that we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to say this slowly so that the total number of non primary residence for short term rentals. Ah that our issued ah, 500 or less. I'm sorry. 500 at a camp. An hour issued by the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. That was a.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Woman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, fine. Mm.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But as of this point, I think Councilman Councilwoman Pierce indicated she was going to make a motion when she queues up again. So as of right now, unless somebody has adopted the motion, the recommended action, we really don't have a motion on the floor to amend.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So. It could be a friendly amendment to somebody else's motion. Or if you wanted to make a standalone motion, that would be perfectly fine too. But as of now, we don't really have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll make it friendly so that we can discuss that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that it, Mrs. Devine?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know my time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see. Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, that's. It gives me. It gives me 7 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seven.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm all kidding. I'm not going to take that long, actually, because I see that the cast members, Pearson Price, have recused. And I know they have a lot of things to say or continue to say. I want to go ahead and keep it short.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The only the only thing with me about about this whole issue is the fact that, you know, we are a coastal city and we have a lot of Airbnb housing that takes place along the coast. And one of the issues that I see up and down when I as a member of the Coastal Commission, is this battle'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going on with the cities that the want to have Airbnb or want to get their total tragic occupancy tax. And I don't want to use a short term whether or not you understand what I mean. But the thing is, is that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's all about access and access to the beach. And our access to the beach here is it's an area in district three, district two. And maybe a sliver of this one. So those are those are the ones that I'm concerned about in terms of what ever plan we come up with that that we keep in mind that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there are going to be people who want access to those homes because they've never seen the beach before or they want to experience Long Beach. So my question in this sense is, is there or has there been a study or maybe it's coming where we know what those rates are?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is it a bifurcated rate where we have one in four coastal zones and one's more inland outside of the coastal zone in Long Beach? Do you answer that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm not sure what you're referring to when you're referring to a rate. You mean a rental rate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Retail rate, like how much Airbnb homes go for or a. A rental along the coast is old versus both versus inland.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think we have data on the actual rental costs that are bifurcated by the coastal as opposed to the location. We do have some data.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But not broken out in that manner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My concern would be that making sure that. If we are going to have a plan here in terms of how many we're going to have, whether it's a thousand or 500 or 1% or have a percentage point, I want to make sure that whatever we come up with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At least half of that or a good number of that. That along the coast, along the coastal zone excuse me, along the coastal zone are affordable. Because that's one of the major reasons why cities up and down the coast are are are struggling with this because there's there's that there are there are neighborhoods or areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, the Del Mar. Del Mar is a very expensive place to be. And there's nothing there. They would be affordable alone. They are more. Yet you can come to Long Beach. I have an experience and it would be a lot more if not experience have an opportunity to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. That's tr that would be provide a good experience for families that there have been there before. So I will just throw that out there because I think, you know, for you, especially in the District three, that's going to be that's that's a that's a big concern.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know it is for for me in the sense that, you know, if I if a family of four wants to come to the beach in Long Beach and they see that there's an extra available pretty close to the beach or on the beach itself that they want I would want them to have that good experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and want to make sure it's affordable. So all that to say is that I want to make sure that where I would come up with, whether it's my poor kid or not and I don't know whether we need to barricade it at that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We provide continued access to a to the beach. And I yield my 50 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And this is worse.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Councilman Turanga.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Count towards my time, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I guess my only response is I haven't seen any ordinance up and down the state that actually attempts to regulate the affordability of units that are put on the market. What I have seen, and you would know better than I from your experience on the Coastal Commission, is that the Coastal Commission will not approve a short term'",
        "'speaker_13': 'rental ordinance if there is some outright prohibition against allowing them in the coastal zone. And the Coastal Commission, as you pointed out, in wants to encourage that kind of use. But what the Coastal Commission has been approving are restrictions that restrict it to hosted only and it seems like the Coastal Commission has been okay with that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But I haven't seen an affordability component in the ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. In terms of hosted. But in there that element of affordability as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's one, right? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. Thank you for answering my my questions earlier. And thank you to the conversation so far. And I would like to make a motion now and hear from my colleagues on where they're at with it. There are some.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Quick little things and then I'm going to actually read the ordinances as we went over earlier today. Mr. Mayes. I want to make sure that it's clear that the total is a requirement and not an option. I'd like to create a certification for platforms that pay TOT and work with the city on enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that we can list that and have host work with those platforms. I would like staff, whatever number we come up with today. And those in the audience know that these last four days have been probably the hardest four days of my term on council.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's been very tough. I would like us to get to a place where we have a cap today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In in light of how this item came forward, that staff monitor the housing vacancy rate and when the housing vacancy rate reaches 9%, that staff agenda is an item in front of this council to discuss if we make a change to the cap.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This way. The item that's been in front of us for the last two years where we've been talking about a percent, can come back for a full discussion. But for me, when the 1% came up, I didn't register that 1% with 1700 units.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that's something that I cannot in any way as a housing advocate support. And so I'm trying to find us a place where we can get a cap today. 500 is on the floor right now. See where we get.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But that staff be the one to actually agenda, is it not a two from four. And that if that were to be supported by this council, that it'd be the same time every year that we revisit that housing vacancy.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If it's every January or every march, that there's a process in place to have that discussion. Now I'm going to get into the more specifics here. On Section 5.77, it should read. The SDR operator shall not operate more than one primary residence ACR in more than one non primary residence stars in the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Section 577030 before. This is the total number of primary residents. Hold on to yes, this is the total number of non primary residents. I'd still like to hear from my colleagues on where they're comfortable. Item or. It's 577050.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Unhosted stays in a str shall be limited to 90 days per year. All stays in a non primary residence shall be presumed to be unhosted. I know we've had lots of debate over definitions, and I wanted to make that clear.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is a significant change that I want to hear from my colleagues as well. Hosting platforms. This is 5770708. Hosting platforms shall not process or complete any booking transactions for stars unless the ACR has a valid current ACR registration number issued by the city to the operator.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We would also like to list the date that that permit is valid on the host platform. I'd like to. I think that these things are the following that I'm going to talk about are are assumed in the ordinance but not teased out.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Hosting platform shall not process or complete any booking transactions that would exceed the number of days in section 577050. We talked about that today. I am comfortable with Councilmember Price's comments around allowing the clerk and the process of 50% plus one support that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm not sure if we don't have a census track how we are able to get there. I think based on all my conversations with city staff, it has to be a census track. And honestly, like if you get four neighbors at 4000 homes, they can they can figure out a way to get it if it's something that'",
        "'speaker_12': 'is is a priority for them. So I support your comments on that one. Enforcement. So we know that in a lot of cities we have a discussion about we finally have regulated, but enforcement is lacking and we're really struggling.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I want to make sure that there's no gray area here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, you'll have to queue up again.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. I'm sure my council colleagues would like me to continue and I can stop talking for the rest of the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you have to queue up again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I wanted to clarify one thing about the opt out provision, and that is the opt out provision should only apply to non primary unhosted. So the vacation rentals. So if there are residents who are home sharing, if it's your primary residence, the opt out is not to pet you against your next door neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The opt out is to prevent location rentals coming to the neighborhood. If the neighborhood wants to petition for that. The opt out provision is supposed to be the intent behind it is to allow neighborhoods and neighbors to have a voice in this process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so reducing the threshold of how many signatures they need to get makes it a meaningful voice because the two thirds number in a census track is nearly impossible to achieve, whereas the 50 plus one is a much more realistic number.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we have safeguards in place to ensure that it's property owners, it's those who have property values at stake and long term vested interests in the property. That will be the ones that will be able to circulate petitions and get those signatures.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That addresses that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Excuse me, Susie, can I stop for just 1/2? Can I address the vice mayor? Vice Mayor, I know we have the time limits in place and we have them in place for a good reason. But I don't think we ever contemplated that we would stop someone from Make in the middle of a motion.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the reason I say that it's going to be impossible for the city clerk to follow it. I'm having a hard time following it. So I feel like we should let the maker of the motion finish her motion, even if it goes over the time limit.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then we can impose the time limit on further discussion so that we have one cohesive motion that people can understand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're the city attorney, so I think that's a good idea. Thank you. Okay, good.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Mr. Mays, should I yield my time to Councilmember Pearce?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah. I don't know if it's so much yielding time. I think we should just let Councilwoman Pierce finish your motion without regard to time constraint within reason, and then just impose it as we go through the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Did you make a note of my comments, though?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I yeah, I think so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Listen, part of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Plus you have 2 minutes and 46 seconds left.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, I have until I finished my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mrs. Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I was talking about enforcement. 577090. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in chapter 1.3 to the fines shall be 1000 for each violation. Each separate day in which a violation exists shall be considered a separate violation. Section 577.090. If three fines have been issued against a host, so I'd like to remove the word STR and replace it with'",
        "'speaker_12': 'a host within a 12 month period. Blah, blah, blah. The rest of that piece. 577090 should read any person. Or host. Hosting platform or SDR operator convicted of violating any provision of that of the. The city may issue and serve administrative subpoenas again to any person, any host hosting platform or SFR operator as necessary to obtain a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'specific information. The same thing for section 577090j. Any person, any host hosting platform or ACR operator. I know this is assumed, but I want to make sure it's clear. It's unlawful to be a host unless the responsibilities of 577.070 are not fully complied with.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I know it's implied, but want to make sure it's clear noncompliance with any stated responsibility under section 577.07 will result in a violation fee of $1,000 per day. Per violation. Ladies and gentlemen, that is my motion. I do support the low.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The lower number. I look forward to hearing from my council colleagues again, reminding us that we have unlimited amounts on hosted stays. But understanding, you know, this has been a long conversation. So I'll come back up in a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And who else do we need a second of that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm seconded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, fine. This is Bryce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I did it. Okay, so in addition to the opt out lowering the threshold that I already articulated, I'm hoping my colleague is amenable to that change. I would also like to request that under section 5.77.070 hosting platform responsibilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe that it should be a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Responsibility of the platform to remove any multifamily property owners who have requested to be on the prohibition list. And I believe if the property owner has exercised due diligence to place themselves on that list, they should not be fined and the platform should get a warning that it is not in compliance with the city's regulations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'd like to add that as as a friendly as well. In addition, in terms of the number right now, the ordinance as proposed allows for 1700, roughly 1700 non primary short term rentals. And I know Councilwoman Zendejas suggested that maybe that limit be 500 as opposed to the percentage that's proposed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I take to heart the comments by Councilmember Ranga because I do represent the coast and I know how important it is to have access to the coast and how important that is for the Coastal Commission. In fact, every project in my district we talk about access to the coast and allowing for access to the coast.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my to to be meaningfully compliant with that, my recommendation would be that we, we, we kind of find a happy medium and allow for a thousand, no more than a thousand as opposed to the 1700 or so that would currently be allowed no more than a thousand non primary stars.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that we're meeting in the middle in terms of Coastal Commission's interests and access, because this is going to have to be a process that we're going to have to be compliant on many levels with in terms of access to the coast.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So but I'd love to hear from my colleagues on that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Before we go any further, I want to. You did not make a substitute motion. You were making, I think, a friendly amendment to Councilwoman Pearson's motion in Councilwoman. Councilwoman Pierce, do you accept those three changes as a friendly amendment?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I accept them. I'd like to hear from my colleagues on the number, though. So I'm not accepting a thousand yet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm price. Is that it?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's it for me. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to an.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. First, I want to acknowledge our staff and everybody that has been involved in getting us to this point over the last few years. It's been a long, painstaking policymaking process, which I think we should respect when we are making policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We should take our time and get it right. So I want to, you know, shout out to the stakeholders who everybody who was involved in this, the hotels, the unions, the host. And we heard from community tonight. There's very few nights that we actually hear from all of the stakeholders in in a process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm seeking to get to a balanced and thoughtful policy. And as we get there, I mean, I think I can support much of what has been proposed. But I am really interested before we start talking about the number and putting caps on a number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to hear from staff in terms of what it's going to cost to administer the program, because I don't want to be upside down there either.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So those are really good questions. I would like to throw out some data to help the council kind of with this this hard policy decision of whether it's 500 or 1000 or somewhere in between. We looked at data from 2010 and 2015 about how many units have just been historically used for seasonal and recreational use, where'",
        "'speaker_7': 'people are leaving them vacant because they're snowbirds or they're traveling or others. That number has been consistently about 1000, so that is what is currently not being really put on the housing stock. It's been about a thousand. We also heard through for hundreds of people throughout this process who owned cars who have come to our community meeting'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So I'm going to guess that number is probably been in the 3 to 4 to almost 500 of actual people who have engaged in this process. And the enforcement is a tough one because right now I think Councilmember Price mentioned it is illegal and we have hundreds and hundreds of these.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we know we have around 800 to 900 on hosted. And the point of the ordinance is to try to get a regulatory system that the city can actually enforce. So the lower that number gets, the harder it is for us to enforce because there's going to be more in the black market.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So a number like 500 is going to be harder for us to get compliance if there's already eight or 900 that are out there. So I can I'll have Linda talk about the enforcement that we have, but I did want to throw that out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That number is probably, in staff's opinion, somewhere in between the 508,000 and in there getting closer to what we have so that we can have meaningful enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I heard in public. Oh, was there. No. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please. In terms of enforcement, I think that in the initial proposal for this ordinance and in the last budget, the city council did approve two budgeted positions specifically for enforcement. So we would have staff on board to essentially enforce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Design and enforce the ordinance, as we've.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Discussed it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if we were to to cap and it sounds like it sounds like we're going to be okay but if we would have put a cap that would miss price or councilmember prices her friendly amendment and a thousand would that get us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Will we be able to to administer this program with the resources that that it would generate?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. And I presume you're speaking from a cost perspective, because the registration fees essentially are what we use to fund those staff positions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we would enforce the 500 or 1000. I think the amount of compliance that you would get would be higher than at the higher number. So with a for the same amount of staff, we would have to go to more houses and do more compliance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If the number was lower to 500, the higher up that number goes, we would have more compliance or you would add more staff, which, you know, right now we're not budgeted for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that I'm clear tonight, our action tonight does regulate stars no matter what direction we take. And if we weren't to take an action tonight, we would just have this ongoing proliferation of seizures in our city with unregulated and unaccountable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. Got it. So. That's it. I'm I'm in support of what's on the floor. I think a thousand is a reasonable number because I think we need to enforce and account for what is already there. Right. And there was a number that was also thrown out in quotes, I mean, from public comment that I want to just'",
        "'speaker_6': 'follow up on in terms of what is actually generated in stories for the city of Long Beach or what has been, because I'm understanding that there's already been some revenue generated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. So there's been approximately since we started collecting it in past in April, approximately 1.8, $4 million in total generated. That's being split 50% between the general fund and between the SRP.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'S&P and why the S&P?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Did I say that wrong?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Todd ordinance works at the voters it or that is on the books is that half of our total goes into special advertising and promotions, half goes into the general fund. So that's not something we can change in this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in light of and I am sensitive to the to the comments about taking away existing housing and and obviously our need to build more housing. Is there any flexibility in the TLT to be able to set aside or dedicate moneys toward housing or affordable housing?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's a policy choice of the council. There is some ability to do that, I would believe, as the revenue source grows. We would encourage you to look at that along with all of your other needs. If you remember about two years ago when we were facing some service cuts, the council wanted us to look at revenue'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And so we put I'm going to estimate the number. I think it was about 750,000 in the general fund as our estimate, and we're right on that number, are actually a little bit higher as more dollars come in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, that really should be something. You look at the budget, should it go to housing, should it go to preserve services? You should go for enhanced services. But that would be a policy decision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we're making policy tonight, so I'm okay with making a decision in that regard. I am concerned also just questioning. So since April, we've collected $1.8 million. Right. And that's less than a year. On how many hosts or stars were were.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually contributing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So right now the top collection is limited to those hosted through Airbnb. We have a voluntary collection agreement with them. I don't have an exact number on the number of hosts that are paying the total. I'd have to work with business license staff to try and get that number, and we'd possibly have to go to Airbnb as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's just Airbnb. There are other platforms that are still operating in the city that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, we are actually in the process of working with HomeAway to enter into a voluntary collection agreement as well. They're the they're the two biggest right now in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Well, I'm going to again, I think 1000 is a is a reasonable number. But I'd also like to hear from my colleagues as well in terms of how, you know, you'd like to proceed with with the TLT, if that's I don't know that it should be dedicated just as happy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think in light of what we've heard, there's a lot of sensitivities around housing stock, our ability to to generate an income to to to to develop more affordable housing. I think this is a source that we need to look at as a as an option as well.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Excuse me. Excuse me, Councilman Austin, I just want to clarify one thing Tom said. The way we read the current tax structure is the only money that would be in play for dedicating to a housing purpose would be the 6% that's not dedicated in the ordinance to the SRP.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If we took money that's already dedicated tax that was passed before Prop 218 and tried to re reconvert that to a different area, we have a problem.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to make a friendly amendment to use that 6%. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Remember we can use it. Always use that we already have the ability to do anything with as far as a general fund expense.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And just add on to that. One of the reasons we do encourage you strongly to look at that as part of the budget discussion is that's currently supporting general fund services, the money that we have. So we wouldn't want to create a whole tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you could give us a direction tonight or put it somewhere, we would need to come back then with reductions somewhere else in the budget. So we expect this funding source to grow over time, especially as we bring on HomeAway and other platforms.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that that be we strongly encourage you to look at that as part of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Looking at my budget oversight committee chair, she's mouthing all kinds of things to me right now. But I do recall that the SAP fund has a very significant reserve and it's a healthy fund. I think we could it would be the moral thing to do for the council to look at appropriating more money for housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely. Huh?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Huh?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you know? Fine. Thank you, Councilman Ellison. You know, I think listen to all these. I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight, because this is the kind of conversation we should have all over the city, because the fact that the crisis that we're in and the city we were talking about, you know, I don't think'",
        "'speaker_0': 'anyone should be denied when especially when your homeowners tell you how you should or should not, when you're asked what you should do with it or being able to rent it out, you know, form it out, that's your house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But as far as homeless and the housing that we have, you are sitting watching that we in any extra money that we get. I'm just hoping all of you feel the same way that all of us feel is that we must put it back into that situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So while I know that most of these short term rentals are in other districts, as a district with high, I am a district with high rental population and I'm a firm believer that we need to find a balance that allows the market to compete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But also, I did not want to displace our residents. You know, in my district we are building housing at a rapid rate. And I want to ensure that this city is also increasing the housing stock, not just even in and out to open up for the market too much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we also need to preserve the character of our neighborhood. We need an oversight to ensure that we're not allowing party houses to become a nuisance. But lastly, I also need to ensure that our hospitality industry is not diminishing with these short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I'm hearing tonight, everyone is for what you should be for, because the fact that you are homeowners, you work your life out to get what you are today. And for our individuals for affordable housing, we're going to have to look at that and we look at it very hard and we know we have a problem and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we're going to have to be able to work with that problem to make sure that we in the city of Long Beach are not one of those who said we forgot about affordable housing because we are very, very serious about that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you home and I want to thank every and every one of you who are very considerate and compassion. But we're trying to do for the city of Long Beach. So beautiful city. I love it most of my life.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Probably all my life. But what I've seen, I love it and I hope we continue to do the right thing by residents, especially by affordable housing. And thank you guys very much. I'm going to give this to Mrs. Mongo and that feeling any time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because that. Yield your time to her. Councilman. Councilwoman in Diaz. Amelia, my time to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I don't need too much time. I just have a couple questions. Thank you, Councilmember Austin, for that recommendation of maybe having that 6% go to affordable housing. As a affordable housing advocate, I think that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wanted to know, is that something that realistically can be implemented?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then just procedurally that issue we can't decide tonight hasn't been agenda ized at all. That is usually something you would typically do as part of the budget process. It could be expedited. It could go to the Budget Oversight Committee for a recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I maybe didn't make myself clear before, but what I was trying to say is there's a total basically of 12%. Six of it currently must go to the special advertising and promotion fund. So the only other revenue is the other 6% that is currently earmarked for anything that the council wants to put it to towards the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'general fund. So it's that 6% we're talking about, we need to agenda. Is that for another evening for discussion of how that goes. But that money could. Or a percentage of that 6% certainly could go into some form of affordable housing if the council wanted to make that policy decision.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And what I'd suggest as staff is what you're asking us to come back with some information. I'd like to come back with you about what's already in the budget, what is the projection, how much is going into general fund versus SRP?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then that will help you and look at our budget context that will help you make some decisions when we get to that point for budgeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I would like to I am very interested to see on how that would look. So if you guys can please do that, that would be great. Another question and just procedurally.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you could make that as a friendly that, I'll make sure that it gets into the motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I would like to make that as a friendly. Thank you. And also, you know, with considering that, I still think that something.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Way too much. Obviously, I would prefer because being an affordable housing advocate and in the first district again where we have a big like it's been said over and over again in the in the first district especially, we have a big affordable crisis, affordable housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would I don't support the 1000. I think that, you know, I could I could see why maybe 500 would be too too much of a drastic move for us right now, even though that's where I want it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't know that I can have the support for that. So I moved that. At least we do. Maybe now let's not do any more than seven 750. As a family. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Hmm. Okay, before we go any further, Councilwoman Pierce, are you acceptable of those two friendly amendments? One has to do with bringing back information on the budgeting process for the TOT tax. And the other is to reduce your thousand cap to a 500.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'A sorry to a 77. 750 would be the friendly. Okay, so that's what we're sitting at. 750.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is an admission they are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's 750. Just to be clear, we're talking about 750 UNHOSTED unit agents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Limit the mix.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Of non primary residents. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, procedurally, but that also had to be seconded by the second. There are the motion would. So it's you know.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're rolling with friendlies today. I know we don't always.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But procedure, that's all we need.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We need to know that the second of the motion is fine with it as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I mean, if.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or from my other colleagues on that, because I think that this five minute limitation, everything is kind of piecemeal right now. So I'd love to hear from everybody before we land on a number.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, Mrs. Diaz. Yes. Thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mongo. So let me help with Mr. Mays. Mr. Austin. Councilman Austin and Councilwoman Zendejas item. As chair of Budget Oversight, what I'd like to see, and I think would be helpful in the discussion related to affordable housing. When Councilmember Austin talked about the ACP funds and the surplus that we have that that was a voter, it would'",
        "'speaker_10': 'have to go to the voters. But we just had a discussion about housing. So what I'd like to do is, as a friendly agenda is at the February 11th EOC meeting, a discussion about. Affordable housing. Receiving a percentage of the revenue from short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Would you be open to that as a friendly? And then I can make sure that report comes back that has all the details related to what the process would be, how much it would be separating it out by hotels versus if you want to do SDR only, or if you want to do the full taxation amount, what'",
        "'speaker_10': 'those numbers would be, we have those from a previous BOC meeting.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You're talking about total funds for fairly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Housing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. I mean, I think that the I agree with staff that it needs to be done in the budget process. So I don't think it's something we can skip ahead to. I mean, especially after. Me reallocating funds last time, how upset some people were.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So, I mean, I think it makes sense for that to come back through the budget process, whatever time you want to take on the B or C to explore that and go for it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. As long as. Okay. And then I think one of the challenges for us in the fifth District is we do have some amazing Airbnb landlords. We met this weekend with one of our neighborhood associations, the ranchos.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They have some amazing, unique homes. But if we put the cap at 700, there are currently 1300 participants. Participating without a law. And those individuals who are not participating because they're waiting for a law won't have a chance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I think one of the things we might want to consider is similar to how we did spreading out dispensaries. It would be great if we could spread out the stores. So they're not all concentrated in downtown or they're not all concentrated in the shore.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Ms.. Tatum. We have three enforcement areas. For development services, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Those generally.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correspond to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The police report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Police districts as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Wonderful. Well, police. Previous police districts before we added South Division back. Great. So that means that there are three areas of the city. And so my proposal would be. Until housing stock reaches. Councilman Pierce, can you remind me what you wanted it to be?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Each 8%. Until housing stock reaches 8%, that we limit the number of short term rentals. 2.6%. That is less than the 1%. It comes in somewhere around, I think, 950. However, you would limit the number in any district.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So in any development services district to no more than. 500. So that means that. That means that in part of the second, the third, the fourth and the fifth between the four of us, the East Division, there would be no more than 500.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It doesn't increase the limit of the whole city above the 950. But it also means that. North Long Beach, who has very few, if any at all right now, would potentially be able to have someone who say runs out to a student September through June.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They'd be able to do their short term rental in the summer. Right now, they would not be able to. Anyone who is not currently in the platform or aware of this discussion has no chance of participating. Well, there's currently, according to Ms..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Tatum's discussion with me earlier, 1300 people participating in the process today. And if we take it down to 750 or 1000, that means that of the people who are participating today. A third of them won't be able to participate legally.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So to answer if I accept this one, is that no one's operating legally right now. And so the idea that we would grandfather in or give people that are currently acting illegally, which seems to me like was part of the conversation, I think I have struggled with this so much the last four days.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm good with the cap. I cannot support a thousand and I'm good with coming back with the percent discussion. When our housing stock reaches 8%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm trying to not reward people who are currently participating. I'm trying to reward the people that are not participating.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The comment that you said that there's no way that people that are currently participating.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No I'm saying the people who are not participating because it's not legal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mhm.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Are not going to have a chance to participate because.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Currently that's not true. Because what's going to happen is city staff could you answer the question of how we would give permits to two operators or to host.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's going to depend on how the how we set out what that number is going to be. And I think if we're going to set a number around 500 or 750, a low limit lower than who we have currently operating in the city, we're going to probably have to end up doing it by lottery.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it ends up being fair to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So is there a reason why we wouldn't do a first come, first serve?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because how are we going to know, you know, if we have already? So in terms of the 1300s that are operating about. 890 or so our non primary, the other ones are hosted. So let's say that we have this number above and everybody comes on the same day.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'How, how are we going to really determine which is that first one, you know, if. That's my problem. I'm not sure if we are going to have to step back and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Really look at this issue. And I was trying to get that lottery to be more neighborhood based, right? So like in the ranchos, if there was a limit that they wouldn't have more than and I didn't want to get too complicated.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't want to say, okay, the ranchos is 1400 homes. No more than 1% of the ranchos can be used. It just got to be such a linear level. That was too complicated. So I tried to stay at the top level, which is enforcement districts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the reason I thought enforcement districts made sense is development services is going to be doing the enforcement. And so if we wanted to say, well, allow a thousand units and no more than 33% in any enforcement district, that helps, too, because there are going to be districts that are never going to reach that maximum.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They're are just areas that aren't as popular. So it kind of limits it in a way that also helps with housing. I was just trying to come up with a solution so that we don't have I mean, here we are again, fistfights in the lobby because there are currently almost 900 and those are the ones we know'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of. And then I'd like also to talk about something that I have not seen covered here. I want to know how we ban. Platforms that don't abide by the rules. If you are a platform and you don't abide by the rules, I want to ban you and give you a two year probation or whatever it is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But if we have a neighbor who has been put on notice that they cannot host and that. Platform continues to post their unit that platforms should be banned from our city. And otherwise I don't know how we continue to enforce it becomes too expensive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is your wish, that should probably be included in the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Motion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'd like a friendly to have the staff come back with some kind of process for ensuring that when platforms do not obey our ordinance and participate, that there is a probation and banning process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I'm supportive of that part.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't know how we get to the other part. I'm just throwing stuff out there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I've as I said, I've really struggled with this the last several days. And and the thing that I know that I'm comfortable with is a low number and exploring a percentage at a later date. And. You know, I've done a lot of work on this over the last almost three years and.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I know that we're not going to get to a place where everybody agrees, but when we're struggling on housing, questions like the bond last week, it makes sense to me that we're protecting our housing stock. I would like to get to a lower number.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So what if we propose half a percent? That would be 850.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Like I hear from my.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Colleagues, there's 890 in the city. That means only 40 of them would be. Theoretically not that those should get priority. I almost feel like the people who are not on a platform right now should get priority. But I don't know how to do that either.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or if you could get a letter of support from every neighbor that touches your property.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So with that, we've got a couple other folks queued up. I'll do one more round of that and then see what I can accept.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I just use me.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Councilwoman Pierce, before we move on to another subject, I want to. I was hoping I could get some clarity when you first mentioned the percentage of rental housing stock that you are concerned with, the number you gave us was 9%, and then that over time morphed into 8%.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I don't know if you missed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The housing the healthy housing vacancy stock from all the housing advocates. And I believe the city said it, too, is 8%. Okay. I do not want to chip in to that 8%. So maybe you can come back when the housing market is looking at like it's 8%.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I had said nine because I thought if we started exploring a percentage at nine that it would make sure we protected that 8% and didn't dip into it with stars. So that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A little bit.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It makes a little bit sense, except your motion was at nine nine. And I want to make sure. Are we.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'd like to keep it at nine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So my friendly is to be at a half a percent until housing stock reaches 9%. And then it would come back to the council agenda used by the staff to potentially go up to 1%, which means it doesn't automatically go up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I definitely want to make sure it doesn't automatically go up. I would like to ask staff I've heard four different numbers and this will help me get to a place with you. I've heard four different numbers on how many non primary units we've have.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Where does that data come from?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This was data that was put together by a host compliance. When we initially started this, the study. When was that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'When was that? Yeah, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It was March of 2018.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My question is, more than that, we have a data set, and I know that there's another data set that other people have talked about. And perhaps whenever we're looking at this data, we could make sure we're comparing, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Whether I don't know what the other platform is that people have used to compare data, I know that it's difficult to get. The second part is. I lost my thought. I'm really trying to to get to a place where I'm comfortable tonight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Having the percentage go up. I want to make sure that it's it's a process that this council has to go through again. The percent is still an issue, a challenge. And I I'll give one more round to hear from my colleagues and then and then see where we're at.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And my last question is, you made a change, I think, to limit all vacation rentals in the entire city to 90 days. So. In my neighborhood. I have a neighbor who lives here part year and they live in Utah part of the year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So they wouldn't be able to rent out their home anymore for part of the year when they're gone. And so is there any flexibility in allowing people who use it as their primary residence?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So when.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Rent it, when they're.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If it's their primary residence, they get 90 days currently in the ordinance. The goal was to make sure that we're not having big companies come in. I don't know if they're if staff wants to talk about another process that might be able to help somebody that lives here half time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the problem with that is not in your side, but the staff determined a new a new made up rule of what a primary residence is. It has no legal or taxation standing. And so they determined out of their analysis, 275 days make something a primary residence.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's means that you go out of town for maybe the summer. But that's not the experience of people who take care of family out of state and all those.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think it's the majority of experience. And when we start trying to govern for every half of a percent of a population, then we get in a sticky place.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would just argue and again, against development services, no disrespect, I appreciate the work that you did. In my talking with platforms, I think that the average number of people for a non primary residence and again the definition of non primary is completely it shouldn't be named that but.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The number of days they extend to their property does not align with what development services staff are saying. That's all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am going to ensure Bruno.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I'd like to follow up on the 90 day rule. Consider for at least the east side. Think of the north neighborhood north of Cal State, Long Beach, north of Atherton, between Olivetti and Bellflower. So our stories are, I would say, primarily student housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So classes started today at Cal State Long Beach, and they'll end on May eight. And that, I think is 108 days. So if there's nothing magical about the 90 days, you could extend it to, say, 120 days and accommodate student housing for a semester.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A little different than the folks giving up their house for the summer. You could actually accommodate student housing this way. And then I just want to get in the weeds a little bit on the petition issue. As I said, we don't have a lot of good experience in the fourth year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a lot of experience with petitions, and it has to do with preferential parking districts. Every street that dead ends into Atherton from Palo Verde to Bellflower, is a preferential parking district street. Every one of those streets had to have a petition signed by the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what we found through trial and error, and this was at the recommendation of public works, is do this by mail. A lot of speakers here warned about pitting neighbor against neighbor of you send neighbors out with a petition.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You have two problems. You're welcoming arguments. And also you might have a sales job on behalf of the person circulating the petition. We found very few neutral petition carriers in preferential parking. So I guess maybe since we're in the mode of friendly amendments, if we're talking about petitions, I would make a friendly amendment that this be done'",
        "'speaker_8': 'by mail. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fine. And are you going to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to go with these emotions. We're going to wait to everyone finish The Apprentice, because we've got about nine of them. And when we go see the attorneys, we're just going to continue until we make the final motions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right. I don't think we're there yet. I'm not sure if if I understood. Counsel man super, super, nice, friendly amendment. It is to require that a petition be circulated via email right then door to door. So, Councilwoman Pierce, is that something that you can embrace?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So it would require a petition to go out via mail rather than a door to door solicitation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think I'm okay with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You've got to think a little bit because it's the first time I've heard it. Okay. I'll. I'll speak at the very end and reconfirm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to minimize.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's an interesting concept because it doesn't require the residents to circulate the petition door to door and get themselves in a confrontational situation. I like it. I'm wondering, is there a way that we can validate the signatures and, you know, make sure that the the property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Address matches up with the property owner that's on the signature and all of that. Is there some sort of verification or maybe an affirmation that can be included in the petition from the person who signs it?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So typically we would probably on a going forward basis, if this were to pass as part of the implementing regulations, we would probably draft a form of a petition that would include an affirmation swearing under penalty of perjury.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As I understood the main motion part of what Councilwoman Pierce wants is for the city clerk's office to take the responsibility for verifying the signatures. They're well versed in doing that. I assume they can do that in this case.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. I think that actually would work out a lot better for the residents as well, because they don't have to put themselves in a situation where they're having those uncomfortable conversations. I like it to the extent that that matters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I like it. I did want to also add.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember, I hate to interrupt, but we should bring back to you some of the cost of mailing as well. That currently is when we do preferential parking that's passed on to the people who are doing it. It's normally a pretty small area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we're talking of of a larger area, we should get you that information so that you have it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that would be important, but I would like it to be included in the ordinance. We can discuss it when we do, when it comes back to us and we have to vote on it. But I think that the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Organizations that want to circulate the petition can bear the cost of that depending on what it is. But I think the cost of mailing is, is, is probably manageable. But I am interested in seeing that now. Right now, the ordinance as proposed says the timing of the opt out petition process is 180 days after.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't have the language in front of me, but after the law is adopted, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. But.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Including Coastal Commission. It's 180 days after Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_13': '180 days after coastal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So laws adopted approved by coastal 180 days after. Is the statute of limitations in terms of when you can bring up circulate a petition? I think that's problematic because if you look about look at this and look at generations to come, you know, maybe the neighborhood is okay with the vacation rentals in their home today, but'",
        "'speaker_5': 'maybe future generations aren't. So what I would like to do is add a provision that allows for residents to file.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A, quote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Request for consideration to circulate petition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'After the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Timeline has expired. So if the timeline has expired, they can petition development services for a request for consideration to circulate petition. If that was permitted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The threshold would be two thirds of the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Property owners in the tract, not 50 plus one, and they would have to get signatures gathered and submitted within 60 days. So it allows for the neighborhood to continue to have an interest in circulating a petition in their neighborhood, but requires them to petition development services for the opportunity to do so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It raises the threshold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that there are protections in there to ensure that there's enough outreach conducted on the law, since the law won't be fresh as it will be 180 days out.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So as I understand, that proposal is in essence, there will there will always be an opt out provision, if you would opt out within the first 180 days with 50% plus one anytime after that, you could opt out with the census tract.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Two thirds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And with a request to enter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With a request to develop an observation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess that was a question to me. Add the proposed ordinance and I can tell you what page it's on. It says that the 180 days are after it's approved by Coastal Commission. So right now, as the ordinance is written, you have 180 days from the date, whatever date that is, that Coastal Commission approves it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right now, as it's written, there would be no more opportunity to petition. So ten years from now, a neighborhood couldn't petition for an opt out. This is saying that even once that statutory period has run, you can apply for consideration to circulate a petition.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So just for clarification, the way it's currently written there is and correct me if I'm wrong, but there is an opt out provision after three years. So if they were off or if they were. If the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If if an area had actually opted out, then three years later people would come back and it could be repealed. So the onus is on the people that want to repeal it to circulate a petition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's for those that have already opted out. Correct. Not for a fresh opt out petition. I would like opportunities for fresh opt out petitions as homes change, generations change, characters change, etc..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This woman appears to accept that as a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I guess my one question is on the. Mike is on the two thirds versus 50%. So originally you're okay with 50%, but not for the latter period. I mean, it would make sense to make some consistency. So if you could make it 50% plus one, then I would be comfortable with it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure, I'm the owner and I'm open to it. The only reason I was trying to do that is to distinguish petitions filed in the initial petition hearing from those filed after the petition period. And so it's placing upon the petitioners an additional burden because they've fallen outside of the petition period.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm happy to. I mean, if we're going to just make a 50 plus one, then why even have a termination period?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, I mean, I think that that was some discussion around having it always be available, but not wanting it to be all the time. You know, if it was 180 days rolling, then you would be able to maybe every 180 days have an option, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I don't I don't like the two thirds number. I feel like that is difficult. So. Okay. And so we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can make it 50% plus one for the petition. But I think there should be a petition process because even look.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm good with the process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Yeah. The property owners who are choosing to rent their house out as a vacation rental and going through the city process to get licensed and following the rules, also have rights that we need to honor and respect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they need to be able to have some sort of notice of when their restrictions on their property are going to change and their opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'As I've said before, this was the one area that I, I was really trying to focus on the caps and the other areas. So this is where I dug in. But it just makes sense to me if we're going have 50% that it stayed consistent, if that's where we're at.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So. So now the the I guess the accepted friendly is that at any time a neighborhood could opt out at any time with 50% plus one. So whether so we would. Right now the way it's written is they would have to choose to opt out within 180 days after Coastal Commission approval.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But if we remove that restriction, they would be able to opt out at any time with 50% plus one is that I just want make sure that's understand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that's where Councilmember Pearce is comfortable.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. And comfortable with the mail piece as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Still have to petition if it's outside of that window.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. So the only. Okay. So. So the only difference is, after 180 days, they would have to request permission from development services to circulate a petition. But they wouldn't have to do that in the first hundred and 80 days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me. No, we don't have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Company. I'm. I made a friendly. It was not accepted, so it was accepted in a different form. So I'm really not sure where we're at. I want the property owner to be able to have some notice that there's going to be petitions circulated about his or her property and to have some understanding of when that might come'",
        "'speaker_5': 'so that it's not in perpetuity. And so I, I assume that happens. Putting forth an appeal process would allow them to put forth the effort, but would have a different standard than the initial statutory period. But I'm open to hearing ideas and thoughts because maybe someone else has a better pathway for us to get there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. So we're not there on that particular friendly yet.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. And just thanks, everybody, for going through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This process with us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, fine. Councilman, your anger.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. The the excuse me. If I missed part of the conversation, I had to take a bio break. Yeah, of. In regards to the discussion that we had earlier, I didn't hear any more about the number versus the percentage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then there was a discussion again about reintroducing the percentage and forget the number. So where are we with that? Is it is it is it a number or is it a percentage? What are we looking for?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't think that we've settled on anything. There's been a lot of discussion. We've talked about 950, seven 5500, a half a percent, a 4%. So that's still up for consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. In terms of the current discussion that we had just finished right now. Just wondering if. We're still looking at census tracts when we're looking at opting out or we're looking at there was a. We can't decide that one either.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I am missing nothing. Right? I'll. I'll come back later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got Councilwoman Cindy us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Question was answered already. Sorry. Up if I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So from my observations and just to quote our city attorney, I don't think we're there yet. And. In the SEC for the sake of time. And I don't know if we're going to get there tonight either. It just sounds like there's a lot of a lot of open ended items still here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, Counsel, we can we can just queue up and keep showing up over and over again. We have to land on something. Right. And I understand, Councilmember Pearce, you are you know, you said you don't you don't feel good about certain things that have been proposed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm really appealing to us all to find some compromise here. I think the original plan from staff was 1700, which was was obviously not a number that that I'm hearing that there's consensus on a not another number was thrown out in a thousand because that's 1% and there's no real consensus here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not hearing that. Then I heard a half a percent and still there's no consensus on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I think I mean, we have to land somewhere and I will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't want to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My district, there's not I'm not hearing a whole lot of rumblings from my constituents around this particular issue. I recognize that this is an issue that impacts our downtown and our coastal communities. And so I'm giving a lot of deference this evening to my colleagues who represent those those communities that are most impacted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we have to get somewhere. And I guess I'm just I'm appealing to you guys to figure it out. You sit next to each other, you're talking to each other. And again, you know, our time is limited. And so I'm not going to take up my 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm just going to say that that I was willing to go with 1%. I'm willing to go with 5%. I want to move this issue so that we can can have some clarity for for many stakeholders that have come out here this evening to advocate for one position or another.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, thanks. Thank you. I know no one. I knew that like we go into tomorrow on this, but it looks like that's what we're going to do. So I'm going to take this back to. This is mango. We are going to get emotional and eventually we.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think if possible, I'm okay. Right. So to kind of wrap in Councilman Price's comments. Councilman Pearce proposed that every year this comes back to the council. And so what I would request is that 180 days resets every year at the time that it comes back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So let's say and the staff will know more if we land on something. Soon. Meaning tonight? When would this come back? As an ordinance to be adopted? And when would that go into place?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's a lot of changes. I know a lot of changes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I mean, we would try to get it back within a month and there's going to be a lot of drafting to to get it in order. But.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we're talking February would be a potential first reading. March would be a second reading. It would implement in June, July.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Technically June or July. But honestly, this involves the coastal zone and wouldn't become effective in the coastal zone. And typically we don't like the bifurcates. So I see it a year in front of the Coastal Commission before we had a finalized ordinance and I would not be surprised if the Coastal Commission sent us back some of their'",
        "'speaker_13': 'own changes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay, so let's start with this. I propose that we target implementation of October one. The reason this is significant is it is also the beginning of the budget year. So if we do decide to siphon off a percentage of funding in a way to something or the other, that means that every year on October one, that licensing'",
        "'speaker_10': 'period resets. And if we change from 1000 to 500, we'll be able to reset the budget at a coordinated time so we can change the amount we expect to receive in total. So my friendly would be that. The ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hopefully implement on October one or if any other date in future years. It come back to council by July 1st for consideration of the housing stock, for adjustments of availability that we start with. I'm just going to put it out there because it sounded like people had a kind of consensus around 1,006%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. No, no. I see two no's, but I don't see any other noes besides the 2%, the two one. So if I have to. Okay, I'll make a substitute motion. My substitute motion is and I know this is hard, but I think we can get consensus here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm really trying to work within the framework you started. I'm open to going down to half a percent, if that makes you feel better. Which is. 850. Don't make a substitute. Okay, so here's my. I want to land like l we got to land on something.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do have s here is my district. Not nearly as many as the two of you, but I have had very heated conversations about these. So resets every year brought back to council with the housing stock in July.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That we start with point a half a percent. Half a percent is 850. Which is less than a thousand, which is way less than 1700. It's half of 1700 until the housing stock is 9%, at which time there would be a recommendation to consider increasing it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that there's importance behind the housing advocates. The less units you have in the market, the less amount. If we really get to move forward with putting the money into affordable housing, the less money there is for the affordable housing side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I think that's something to also consider, right? And then that the ballot process start with a petition that opens every year in July. And is mailed to the situs address. That's the landlord's on record address at the assessor's office of the 100 closest residences.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the reason I say this is right now we have a process in development services that both you and I have tried to work on that costs people $5,000 for a permit to get something done because they have to mail to 1000 feet of the permit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I am 100% supportive of the mail idea. But I also think it's really important that we not make it so expensive that neighborhoods can't afford to start the process. And so I was I'm open to the 300 closest residents.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm open to 100 closest residents. When you call the assessor's office, you give an address, they draw a circle around it, and they send you an Excel file that has the address, the situs address of everyone that is in that GIS mapping zone, and it costs like $29.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that would solve the problem of people who don't live in your neighborhood making decisions for you. Because my census tracts are large and some of the ones in downtown are extremely large. So that would be my friendly counsel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And can I just add that it will be a lot more practical? Is the radius around the that the the area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's what I just said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You said the 100 nearest. Did you mean a radius.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well it would be a radius, yes. But the challenge is the radius around one unit in Councilman Pearce's district is going to be way more units than in mine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not if we're talking about you have 38. The way we do it right now, it's a radius around the property, right? It's a distance radius. Not it doesn't consider the number of units. It's however many, many units are within that radius.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And respectfully, the assessor's office can draw a radius and when it hits 300 units or properties, they can push pause. X. Hartline is the guy who does it. Yeah, I'm just saying because otherwise if you take one property in Councilwoman Pearce's district, she could theoretically have 3000 mailers.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if you want to ban an STR in second district in census tract and I have the exact census tract, it will cost someone thousands of dollars to do that mailing. It would just be prohibitive. And I was just trying to be respectful to people who have a bad neighbor that's a bad landlord.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So or I'm also open to a substitute motion to bring this back in two weeks where staff do an idea of all the things they've heard tonight and bring it back again. But I also want to be respectful of the people who are here for the pool and all the other items tonight too.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Councilman Mongo The radius mailing works very well with projects that we have coming before us because we draw the radius from the project itself. But here, I don't know where you'd start drawing the radius. In other words, would it be the person who had the idea to institute a potential ban?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Would you draw the 300 the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'House you'd like to ban? Well, you want to just ban a whole neighborhood without a bad landlord.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, yeah, that's what we're that's what we've been talking about, that that whole neighborhoods, even though they may not even have a urban or a role, could. Could petition to opt out of this entire process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that is not what I discussed at this dais when this came last time. So just as the heads up that I made a friendly or discussed this other alternative, and I'm shocked that it didn't make it into the ordinance because when I was trying to talk with staff about how do you have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good landlords. And then 3800 people who they don't know get to tell them they can't have it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Even though they have a point of order.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's my time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So and you're but a few minutes over. And so I waited for two months and that's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The chair's decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is so true. Now we're going to move on.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I also have the ability to do point of order maximum.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And first.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I would like to call a question and see where we're at. Okay. So I am going to you know, yes, 1700 was what was on the table before. But we've had somebody here make a motion for a thousand and we've had someone make a motion for 500.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I would like to make a motion. All the things that I read earlier, the small changes, and to include a max cap at 750. With the male opt out. Census tracts. With 50% plus one. And I accept the the petitioning annually from my other two council colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That seems like that's where the support is. And I want to I know that this has taken a long time, but I needed to hear from my counsel colleagues before making a final motion. So that is my motion.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Can I get a second?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've already second in the motion and I'm okay. Or is this a brand new motion?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I was the motion we did earlier, plus what we just talked about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So I'm the second of that motion. I accept that. I do ask staff to if you could please clarify what you believe the opt out provision means in light of the amendments, because I wanted to make sure that that was clear for our residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think when we envision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The opt out provision, it wasn't based around a bad actor, it was just neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Having a sense of whether or not the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Neighborhood collectively wanted to have non hosted or non primary actors in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was not at all based upon a problem property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was just the concept. Do we want them and do we want to support them or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do we not? And non primary ACR would be in layperson's terms, a vacation rental where the owner is not living there. It's being rented out up to 365 days a year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. 19 is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For the non primary, nine primaries, not 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I made that motion earlier.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. She wants to make it 90 for everyone. I tried to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I must have missed that. I thought it was vacation homes could go. I'm talking about non primary vacation rentals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As the ordinance is written, that's how it is.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I called it hosted Unhosted. That unhosted be.'",
        "'speaker_3': '90 days across the board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, I can't support that. I'm sorry. I must have missed that. I can't support that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Point of order here. There's a motion that I see here that was not seconded. Does that motion die? Yeah. There's not there's not a motive. There's nothing here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right. Right now that Councilwoman Price has made a motion. Councilwoman Pierce has seconded the motion. There's been a number of friends. Sorry. Councilwoman Pierce has made the motion. Councilman, Woman Price has seconded the motion. There have been a number of friendlies, some of which have been accepted, some of which have not been accepted.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'One of the first notes I took from Councilwoman Pierce's motion was that there would be a 90 day max across the city for Unhosted rentals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now. The other part.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She called for the question. We didn't vote out of question. She went on and made another motion. No, added to it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Look, I know I don't think she made another motion. I think she was revising her motion to reflect the comments of the other council members so that we could at least land on whatever the magic number is for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we can.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The total number of short term rentals that we would have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the better way of putting it would have been instead of saying kind of question you say, I want to amend my motion.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I wanted to amend my motion to add that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We keep.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The comments. Yeah, that's fine. It's been a long discussion. We've talked about a lot of issues. I want to. I do want a vote, which is why I said call the question, because I would like to take a vote and see where we're at with 750.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'With the changes that I made to the 90 days and with. That being able to be petitioned annually. So the things that we talked about.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I want to be clear on the petition. So. Any time after this has been implemented, this ordinance has been implemented. Anyone within a census tract could start the process on an annual basis to opt out. So yes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Are we still having a first opt out period? In other words, are they required to opt out with? It's currently written that they are required to opt out within 180 days initially and we could keep that. And then on an annual basis, people could choose to initiate that process.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Is that what you're intending?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think that that's the intent of on some price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. So the initial period, they have 180 days to opt out. That would re trigger every calendar year after that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Correct. Call the question. Just have the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vote. I. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is that okay? Can you make exceptions up to this point?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm not sure if Councilwoman Mongo because I can't see the board if she got a second for her motion. Daryl gave her a second. So, yes, there is room for a substitute. Substitute. And Councilwoman Pryce indicated that she's going to make a substitute substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yet the proposed ordinance, I'm going to request that the 1%, which is roughly 1700, be amended to 1000 maximum non primary rentals and that that number can change is subject to change based on the vacancy rates of the city, which shall be reported to council on an annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My motion also requests that. The opt out provision that is included in the proposed ordinance be changed to reflect a threshold of 50% plus one instead of two thirds of the property owners within the census tracts to be petitioned by mail option.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cost of that will go to the census tract and will be reported back by council at the next meeting. My motion is that the platform. Be expected to remove the name of anyone that's on the prohibition list from their site and that they be expected to work with city staff to update that list on a regular basis'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as determined by development services to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Appropriate. Let me just look at some of my other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, she's looking at that. I have another parliamentary question here. There are some aspects of the substitute substitute motion that I like and others that I don't. We break it up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We vote on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Piece by piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we break up, for example, though, break out the 1000. More on that. Break out the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's how we did the friendlies the other day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The. Without a doubt. About. Yeah, about 50 plus one. I like that. But you see, there's one motion there that I don't like. So if I wanted to write the baby with the bathwater, I'd rather use throughout the bathwater and keep the baby.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hmm. That's a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, what? I mean, that's up to you. I mean, I would work better with that if we go down a list. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. But I need further clarification on your motion, because I want to make sure your motion is rather compact, which I like. But are you are that's the totality of your motion, right? So there were a bunch of friendlies and things that cause that were in relationship to Councilwoman Pierce's motion.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's not part of yours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I want to make sure that the opt out is specific to non primary. Properties. So Unhosted whatever we want to call it, the vacation rentals.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So so your motion is in essence to adopt the staff's recommendation as reflected in the draft ordinance, except for the basically two points that you just raised.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. As to that. Yes. So if if so, basically, my motion has two components, the number of properties that can be available for rental as a short term rental and the opt out provision. So that's my substitute substitute.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd like to keep it as simple as possible if if the city attorney's is amenable to it, I'd like to take those two items and take them as separate votes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You could make a motion to divide the question and also was willing to divide the question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I make a motion to divide the question.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With that, I make a motion to reduce the staff's recommendation of 1% of housing stock, which would be roughly 1700. I'd like to reduce that number to 1000. Non primary short term rentals cap.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we ready to vote on it? Yes, I.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So is there a there's there is second to that. Okay. Mongo is second to that. So all we're voting on now is the cap. And the motion is to approve a cap with a limit of 1000. Nine primary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's the motion. Look got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You can discuss it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, but you will get the vote. Can you discuss it now? Yes. Do we vote?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You can discuss it before you vote.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm in support of this item of seconding it. While I would prefer 0.6%, which is a thousand units, so that as we add units to the market, more becomes available. Would you be open 2.6%, which is approximately 1000?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's between 950 and 1020. I don't know the exact number.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd like the numerical cap at 1000 to try to get. I'll still.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. Okay. Mrs. Occupy's peers actually got it. Well, I was on the speaker's list.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I see that I have a real hard time with a thousand considering I just made a motion for 750. So let's, let's vote on a thousand, and we're just gonna have to go through this process, guys.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. The vote on whether or not to accept 1000 is the cap. Yes or no?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I'd like to make a motion that the opt out provision that's listed in the staff's recommendation have a lowered threshold to allow for 50% plus one of the census tract of property owners, and that the property owners have the opportunity to circulate the petition on an annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This cache all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That concludes this item, basically. And we will bring back an ordinance as soon as we can.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah. And that included I clarified with Councilwoman Pryce that that her motion included the staff recommendation. Save for those two items that we voted on separately.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I. Okay. You got me, guys, because I thought that we had passed out being able to vote on different things and there were some administrative things that I wanted to get in. I understand the support wasn't there for the for the 90 days, but it would be a courtesy if I could read back and have voted'",
        "'speaker_12': 'on the other items that that are about enforcement. We've been doing this for a long time today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would I mean, I have no objection to that. But to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can do that, can we?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To be fair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think there was an agreement for the 750 that you were recommending. But then we got tied up on the opt out process and it got very confusing. So the substitute substitute was an effort to try to simplify matters and narrow the issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If council colleagues want to open that up and look at other issues, I'm happy to do so. But I think we were we had a lot of agreement until we got into some disagreement at the end and the conversation wasn't moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I would hate for one minute to throw off a lot of work that was done previously. And I was not clear that that this part was not going to be part of that vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, because that's not.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The way this will come back for a new first reading. So there would be an opportunity if the new first reading to further tweak the ordinance from a minor. I mean, you know, you have to pass it, but you could make minor tweaks to it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Certainly if you wanted to accomplish what you're suggesting, Councilwoman Pearce, someone would have to make a motion to rescind the action we just took and opened it all back up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just wanted to be quick, so I'm going to make a motion so I at least so we don't have to wait an order.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can we follow the speaker's list?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Motion for reconsider place.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Several speakers list. Can she does you have to queue for that or no.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'No, but it would have to be somebody that voted in the. I guess you did vote in the majority. Did you vote for this? Yeah. You didn't vote for the first part. So it has to be somebody that voted for it to make a motion to reconsider.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Make a motion to reconsider to allow Council member Pearce to put the items that she feels are important into this record.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay, so do we have a second for that motion? Yes. All right. So we have a second now. Let's take a vote on the motion to reconsider. Yes or no?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Comes membership in our. Watching carries.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was the second year of the motion where reconsidering.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So now. I'd like to make a motion. I will read this as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Point of order. It's a substitute. Substitute, so I think it's friendly. And we could still play for Kate.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct. Yeah. This would be a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is mainly administrative things that that we talked about earlier. We'll leave out the 90 days. So I would like to add and I read these sections earlier, so I'll try to go fast under section 70, a hosting platforms shall not process or complete any booking transactions for any ACR unless the ACR has a valid current registration'",
        "'speaker_12': 'issued by the city to the operator. Hosting platforms are required to list the SDR registration number and the date that that that permit does expire. Hosting platforms shall not process or complete any booking transactions that would exceed the number of days in Section five zero partitioning ten Section 90.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'D.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If three fines have been issued against an STR. We want to replace the word STR with a host. Section 90. And Section 90 F, I and J. I'd like to replace the words any person with any person, any host platform or SDR operator in all three of those.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's unlawful to host unless the responsibilities of seven zero are not fully complied with. And those are the changes that I would like to have a vote on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But friendly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I accept them as well, but I would like to be able to speak through the speakers list. It's up to you to.'",

And I don't want people to think that because they weren't the maker of the motion, that there's not a lot of recognition and support for the way that the policy was was brought forward.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. I want to first support. Prosecutor Halbert and all the great work he does. And I appreciate you and I appreciate the work you do. And I even had great hesitation last week with making the option for the city auditor to bring forward her amendment to the floor without going through Budget Oversight Committee.'",
        "'speaker_10': '$295,000 is a considerable amount of money, and I appreciate that you have budget savings. And I among our council and a huge advocate for those that save should get to eat a part of their savings. However, at a time when we're facing potential budget shortfalls and we've had hundreds of animal advocates here who can't hire a $40,000'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a year, part time person to clean animal cages when our be safe programs in the summer cost. $30,000. This could be ten of those programs. I would really appreciate my council colleagues supporting sending this to Budget Oversight Committee.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It would not be a long process. The Budget Oversight Committee meets February 11th, and I would be happy to put this on the agenda. But I think it's important for us to do it as a part of a process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think it's important for us to make allocations at this level with a global picture, not just with a single part of mind. Furthermore, I support homeless programs and homeless services. We do have a percentage of a specific kind of funding for those types of programs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is general fund money that could be used for park programs, animal programs, library hours on Sunday and things like that. And so I think that it is important to take a step back further. When I asked Mr. Halbert if it was going out through a contract or any of those things, he was talking about potentially adding'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a staff member. And it's really hard when our animal control staff make minimum wage and we don't have enough of them to clean cages to make this independent decision for $300,000. So if my colleagues would be supportive of my motion is to send this to Budget Oversight Committee to be agenda ISED for the February 11th meeting.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Madam Chair, with all due respect, I mean, I understand where you want to go with this. How do you envision this this working out? It goes to the Budget Oversight Committee and then comes back to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this money is from prior year savings. Mr. Modica, would you be able to tell me if we took this act tonight versus February 11th, when that money becomes available and in which fiscal year?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that when you put me on the spot, it's probably in the next 30 days or 40 days. We're normally closing at the end of February. I think this request is to do that when we close and it's just you're doing it a little early.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we do have that kind of time available. So what I envision is for us to discuss the priorities. We have a budget meeting that has some discussions from staff on the shortfalls for next year and the potential risks and areas that we have to consider.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that this should be discussed as a part of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the city prosecutors department had a $591,000 fine, 19 savings in their requesting $295,525. I'm sure during that B or C meeting, we will be discussing how to potentially allocate the balance. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So? Currently, the staff bring forward a set of recommendations for mid-year. Typically, if a department head does not get their money back, it becomes available for divide by nine in the next year. We made some allocations based on savings and so we already put together a list of what would be funded with this money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I think it's important for us to make a decision and I will speak on my vote. Last week it was with great hesitation that we made that, and I in hindsight, wish I had not been supportive of that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I share the same concerns as Councilman Orson. I understand what Councilman Mongo is saying, but frankly, I think we should start off with congratulations to you for ending the year with a budget surplus as high as you did and not scrambling at the last minute to figure out how to spend every single penny of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'money that was allotted to you and instead telling us honestly what you actually need to help us combat homelessness in the city of Long Beach. I think the fact that you're asking for less than a half or about a half of that is is frankly something you should be rewarded for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do not want to. This is a this money was allocated to your department as a department head to be able to make a determination of how best you want to use that money. You ended up with a budget surplus.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want to encourage our department heads to do that and not feel that they might risk losing that money if they come out with a surplus as opposed to a deficit. So I am wholeheartedly in support of approving your request this evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and I think the diversion programs that you've been involved in in the city have been extraordinary. They have commanded attention from throughout the nation, and they have come in at a very responsible cost in terms of I know how much these programs cost.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Frankly, I'm shocked that you're able to do as much as you do with the budget that you have as a person who does your profession on a daily basis. So I would urge my colleagues to support this item if we're going to have a change of policy regarding surplus having to come to posse first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not opposed to that either, but I don't think we should do it without giving notice to the department heads, because if that's the direction we're going to go, I guarantee you will have less surpluses throughout every department next year.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Ago, so I think it's important to note, Ms.. Price, that Councilwoman Price, that the policy is that they do not get to carry it over. We have made an exception for Prosecutor Halbert for two years and we've only made an exception for city auditor out one year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This was the first time it caught me off guard. I have a lot of questions about it, but the policy of the city is that this is not allowed and that is why it's coming to council because it is an exception.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At which time last year I made similar comments that we really need a process specifically. There are programs on contingency Sunday library hours, be safe programs and other things that right now Grace is bringing to our February 10th 11th meeting a list of here's the priorities and here's how much money is being rolled over.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so we're only going to be able to fund A through F. And so I think that the council should get to know what that is when making the decision. And we made an exception for Prosecutor Halbert last year and the year before two times.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we made an exception for councilman I'm sorry, a prosecutor, city auditor. O'DOWD One time. But I also believe that we we have a bigger discussion that we started, which is the vacancies. We have department heads who come to us on a consistent basis and say, I need seven staff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And to your point, both Ms.. Pearce and Pryce, there are staff vacancies in development services that each year happen, and each year they ask for more staff, and each year they have a budget savings because they don't fill the staff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now part of that is because of the process and the specific challenges that we have in civil service. But we need to get to the bottom of whether or not these departments are appropriately staffed. And Council of Prosecutor Halbert would not have been able to use this money and spend it last minute on printer cartridges or whatever'",
        "'speaker_10': 'he could, because from what I understand, this is a one off funds. It was salary and employee benefit funding that was available. And from what I had in my very short discussion with him earlier today, a few moments ago, he would be using this money for another staff member for this program, which if he stopped at the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'same level he was staffed out last year, he would have the ability to do that anyway. And so. And I don't know what percentage of his total budget is, $300,000. But coming in 1% above or below, it absolutely should be rewarded.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we should have a program that does that. But if we had other departments come forward in my discussions with Mr. Modica, if we had other departments come forward and do the same thing, we would be in a world of hurt and we're already in a position where we cannot fund.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What we've approved to finish this year. And so for those reasons, I implore everyone to support the motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you very much. My comment on this and my perspective, I don't think Dan would even come to us that this wasn't necessary, whether it's for a staff member or whatever it was, and especially at this time of night, you know, because one thing I do know, if you don't use it, you lose it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Doug, I think what you're going to use it for is totally acceptable for us. And I'm concerned and I will totally support you tonight on this item. Thank you. Mrs. Cindy has. You know. Okay.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'All of that is still completely possible because he was so prudent to bring forward the items so early.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We hear from him.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of course.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Very briefly and I apologize. I thought this was going to be your fastest item tonight. I didn't know it was going to be the longest. I do believe this is the fifth or sixth year that the council has allowed my budget savings to be reallocated to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It started, I know, when Councilmember DeLong was on the Budget Oversight Committee. So I do believe there has been a precedent in my office. So I wanted to mention that the second thing is the innovative programs that our office has really is a reflection of a partnership between the council and my office, because I could not have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'started these programs without having the budget savings from previous years reallocated so that we can do creative things that we didn't think of in the current year. So we start programs. We look for grant funding. The biggest reason that I have this much savings are really two reasons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My office has been very aggressive in getting grant funding everywhere we can to bring money into the city of Long Beach. And the second thing is, when we have a vacancy, we delay filling that vacancy as long as we can in order to generate savings, knowing that that savings will help us to fund the next program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to thank you. And I do take to heart all of the comments. And Ms.. Mungo's comments will be taken to heart and I will bring it. Earlier, I was asked to hold off. John GROSS asked me to hold off until January.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was ready to make this request earlier. I would have been happy to bring it to Bossi in October. I was asked to wait till January and then I was asked to cut it in half. This is the first time I've asked for half of the budget savings to be carried over because it was such a large'",
        "'speaker_2': 'amount, because the city is in such a financial situation that it's needed. So I was more than happy to do that. But I do appreciate the partnership. I do appreciate the programs we have are a result of your allowing me to do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I thank you for that. And next year I'll bring it to BMC right away and get this input as soon as possible. But I do want to thank you again for considering it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you and thank you, Doug, for for all that information. I did want to hear from you. I also wanted to thank you for all your hard work that you do. And I will be supporting this. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think we have that tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would just say to the council that. I appreciate that Prosecutor Halbert has had savings, but if every year he has savings, then potentially he has enough money in the budget to do the program. But I don't know that because I don't have enough information at this time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's all. But I really appreciate it. And I do think the program is important. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. So it's no public comment is that we.'",

So the major entitlements that we're looking for are a general plan amendment, zoning code, amendment, zone change, local coastal program amendment, modification to site plan review and a local coastal development permit. So back in 2017, this council in a in a pretty long hearing about 5 hours, heard the project and gave us some direction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also heard some concerns from both the council and the Coastal Commission. And so those included looking at increased recreational components, increasing our connection to disadvantaged communities, addressing sea level rise, addressing height concerns, providing a robust alternatives analysis, providing a parking analysis, and lowering the overall project cost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're going to go through each one of those. Some terms, the recreational components. We heard loud and clear from the council. You'd like this to be not only able to host competitive events and have, you know, lap swimming for everyone, but also to really focus on youth and recreational components.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've added a number of components, including zip lines up in the top left vortex pool, which is in the bottom left is an example of that fun elements like splash pads and water features for kids and some small slides and some cascading features to really increase the recreational component.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'year storm. And so coastal commission under the previous pool, it was designed so that the water in that year would, in those major storms, touch the facility and then recede. And Coastal Commission felt that that was still an impact for sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In this new design, we have designed it so that that water does not touch the facility. So essentially we are completely out of sea level rise from the facility. And we believe that will satisfy that requirement. We also had a major height reduction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're proposing making this an outdoor facility rather than an indoor facility. The original building height was 60 feet. The prior design, which is what you saw in 2017, had a maximum height of 78 feet. The new improved design is what we're calling it has a building height of 35 feet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So a significant reduction. There are a couple of areas where we have higher than 65 and we have the sale element that you can see this is a neat kind of shade structure and also brings that aquatics theme to the to the pool.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so the max of that is 60 feet, which is the top of the mast and the lights, which is equal to the original building height. And the top of the shade canopy is 49 feet. You can see the dotted outline with the old pool was not even the prior design.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so this is a significant improvement from a from a coastal view, shared perspective. We also look significantly at other alternatives. Those were considered in the air, which also went through a lawsuit to which the city was successful in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We looked at Harry Bridges Memorial Park. We looked at the Queen Mary, and we focused a lot on the elephant lot and convention center. And all alternative sites were determined to be inferior to the Belmont as Belmont Pool.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We then went through a process with council to give additional information about our our turn alternatives analysis. In particular the elephant lot and really spend some additional time on it. We're able to show in that analysis that the elephant lot is actually inferior to the Belmont site in the in the revised design in that we would not'",
        "'speaker_7': 'have sea level rise impact at the Belmont pool site, but we would have sea level rise impact in that same scenario at the elephant lot. We'd also have to do additional parking. We'd have to build a parking structure in order to accommodate that for at a significant cost and probably in excess of $50 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's also leasehold issues. We also looked at environmental data and saw that from an air quality perspective for swimmers that are outside, it's superior to be at the Belmont Pool site and a number of other factors. We looked at parking analysis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are currently 1116 spaces at the prior facility under the new facility, with all the parking improvements that we've made. We would have an increase. 1152. The old Belmont Pool had a parking demand of 834 spaces because it had significantly more seating.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed facility demand is 614 spaces, so we are well within you know, we have almost double the amount of parking that we would need and well within actually lower than the previous the previous pool. We also did some additional design modifications.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We went out to our stakeholder advisory committee and talked to them about the project. That's been the committee that the council asked us to really engage with as throughout this process and not talk about some of that in a second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've also engaged with the 2028 Olympics Committee, and they are highly interested in having diving at that facility. We believe everything that we've done in our design has been consistent with what we heard in 2017 from the city council as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so here's the picture of the outdoor facility. This used to be an indoor covered pool. This now you can see the bubble was removed significantly lower in height and still a very elegant structure. This is the overhead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you can see that the push to the left was suggesting suggesting that that pool remained. That's the current temporary pool. We would enhance it with some additional buildings and some decking and make it a more of a permanent structure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then you can see the the pools on the right. We've maintained all of our water bodies. So we haven't lost any major water bodies. We are looking to relocate the beach concession. That was a beach concession outside of the facility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Given all the improvements we've done to concession stands along the beach, we don't need it outside anymore. We don't need that one anymore. We recommend bringing that indoors for a year into the facility for a better experience. We also are designing this pool to be Olympic dove ready, which would include the ability to have 10,000 temporary seats'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that could be constructed. And while there's no commitment from the L.A. 28 Olympics, they are very, very interested in having this as a as a potential to consider. And we would create that to them to Olympic standards. We have also increased open space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The original facility had 18 118,000 square feet of open space. The prior design that you had approved in 2017 increased that to 127,000 square feet of open space. The improved design increased that even more to 141,000 square feet of open space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if you look at green space compared to the original facility, it is more than or nearly doubled. In terms of the increased green space. Increased spectator seating. The original design had 1250 seats. That was important to the proponents of the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've actually now increased it to 1555 seats at the main pool and 310 seats at the existing Murtha pool. This is a picture of the support building. There will still be a building on site that is covered, but that really is for locker rooms and for, you know, maintenance equipment and offices.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's a much sleeker design. And so I do want to talk a little bit about cost. So part of the main factor here is that cost escalation has grown since 2014. When we first approved the programing design was $103 million programmatic budget, which over time the cost estimates came in around 145 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was not a realistic project. We have 61 and a half million set aside for the project. And so, you know, we we believe with all these scope changes, we can address the concerns, make it a better project, make it more, you know, in line with cost of commission and council, maintain the bodies of water and also'",
        "'speaker_7': 'reduce the cost to 85 million. We have a lot of public comments. We have over 100 written comments since the public hearing was published for the Planning Commission. All comments received have been provided to you. They relate some of them relate to noise, and I did want to cover that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We actually have less outdoor seating than the previous pool. We also have a glass perimeter wall that is going to be covering the entire facility, which will help with noise. It will be closing at 10 p.m., which will help with noise as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It will have below daytime exterior noise levels and we'll also use directional speech. So noise, you know, has been studied in the air is not an issue. There is one thing that is still being kind of looked at is this concept of a 25 meter wide pool versus 25 yards.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The original design was 25 yards. The stakeholders have requested an increase to 25 meters. We've looked at that and done some additional outreach. We included that in the ER addendum and looking for some direction on that. The costs might be up to a 1.5 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're hoping that can be significantly brought down as we look at some other options and design. And that's currently within the $85 million ballpark range. And so for next steps, we are asking for your approval tonight. We then we originally, when we put this presentation together, had a goal of really trying to get this on the February'",
        "'speaker_7': '2020 Agenda for Coastal Commission because it's here in Long Beach. When you if you approve this tonight, the Coastal Commission will have everything they need to consider that. From a timing perspective, they're telling us they may need a little bit more time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we would ask for the the next immediately available local meeting to be heard here in Long Beach. That will probably be sometime in April or May. We would then do final design and permitting in winter 2021 and get the pool built by winter 2023.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so in conclusion, positive findings can be made for all the required entitlements. The E.R. addendum with the previously certified ETR satisfies fully the sequel compliance. We recommend that you approve the entitlement package and accept the IIR addendum, and this is the list of all the recommendations that we're making to you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There in your packet. I won't read them all in the interest of time. And that concludes stuff's presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And with that, we will start out with the. It's a package. We started with.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'A vice mayor. We have four appellants listed in the order on the agenda would be first appellant Jeff Miller with up to 10 minutes allocated for his appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Would you please come forward to. All right. No problem. So would you please come up to the front? Okay. All right, fine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yes. I do have a PowerPoint presentation if we can bring that up. Seven years ago, the city failed to heed legitimate concerns about sea level rise, flooding, seismic and liquefaction at this location. So ignoring other alternative sites, the city pool planning began giving little regard over costs or Coastal Act limitations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the past six years, this area has been a grassy park with mature trees. A passive park is the correct usage for this geological location. So Saga, more plans, more wasted dollars to appease a special interest group began.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a flood zone. You won't be able to reach the building because it's sitting on an island. This site will require grid work of 80 foot deep pylons in the sand where groundwater is at six foot. These are significant negative impacts to prevent the beach from disappearing completely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city has been backfilling the beach, calling it sand nourishment as worn by the city's own climate change report. Coastal areas should be planning managed retreat. Putting this facility on a plinth with retaining wall or doing sand enhancement is considering armoring which will eventually resolve and acceleration of our beaches.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Coastal Commission will not allow these types of remediation or build up of infrastructure. Long Beach public officials warn coastal homeowners of rising water from climate change will eventually flood their neighborhoods. Yet at the same time, Long Beach promotes plans for a massive pool complex.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ignoring their own advice. Here we are tonight with the latest rendition that has never seen public outreach. This plan has even more flaws. East Ocean Boulevard has already been narrowed. Plans intend to remove East the Living Plaza. Note In this slide, the residential size cul de sac loop in the center with a 31 foot turning radius.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is also the area for handicapped parking. This traffic plan could not possibly be feasible for the Olympics. This is inadequate for traffic management. Here's another missing reality check. Then an avenue East Ocean Boulevard pool entrance is not used only for personal vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's used by oversize vehicles daily. See the earth movers on extended semis, massive beach sweepers, first responders, police, fire and paramedics. Note paramedics are regularly at the pool. Diving areas and children's rec areas have propensity for accidents. So with inclusion of these areas in the pool, plans will require more paramedic visits to the pool.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many cities have closed diving areas because of accidents, lawsuits and liabilities. More oversize vehicles at this intersection include busses, the pool, chemical supply trucks, and there are delivery trucks to the businesses on East Olympic Plaza. You will see military exercise vehicles on the beach, including hovercrafts and Humvees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city claims they will require special traffic control at special events, but this has not been the case. Light and noise are huge negative impacts with a ruthless pool plan. The old and closed Belmont pool contain the noise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Noise complaints from the old closed pool were from illegal skateboarders on the Front Concrete Plaza. This new pool design is a skateboarders delight with the lure of ripping on the concrete stairs, plinth and ramps. The majority of the new noise is from the Open Air Belmont temporary pool from water polo whistles, air horns and P.A. systems.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the operational noise can be so easily abated, why was this not done at the temporary pool? Why did the city not record dust measurements at this pool to full analyze neighborhood impact? These noise violates municipal noise codes as per the city's municipal noise code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Areas near schools, hospitals, so on are considered noise sensitive zones. This pool is right next to a preschool. The oversize towering light poles at the temporary pool saturate residential night neighborhood nightly. These towering lights are twice as tall as the street lights.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Competitive swimming and diving require higher illumination than recreational pools, creating increased light glare clearance aboard the highest diving tower must be 16 feet, five inches. How can the Dove Tower be covered and stay within zoning height register restrictions?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is blatantly false to say there will be no negative light. Noise or traffic impacts with this plan. The EIA addendum states that traffic volume will double due to two large pools. This is without even counting the impact of the new recreational features and frequent special events.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But what makes this plan especially egregious is the city intends on operating this facility 350 days a year from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. at night. This pool is five times larger. It is the size of a football stadium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cleaning the pool will go on long after the pool closing time of 10 p.m., leaving the lights on. Phasing PA speakers away from the residential is not a successful soundproofing plan. Noise from the beach. Events in the temple invade the neighborhood now regardless of speaker direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not only have the residents been subject to noise and light intrusion with the open temporary pool, the noise, lights, traffic and chemicals have decimated the protected wildlife habitat at Bennett and Ocean Boulevard. Fractured open space does not make a park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Coastal Commission considers this open space, free or low cost coastal recreation area, even with large subsidies that taxpayers will be burdened with. These will be charged to use the aquatic center. If you have walked the Belmont Pier, you are fully aware of seagulls perching, pecking and pooping the seagulls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for creating this design, contributing to their activity, and adding places for their target practicing. A pool is not a coastal dependent but with towering light poles is planned exceeds height restrictions. Move it to the elephant lot instead of manipulating zoning heights to squeeze it into a residential neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No parks and rec pools should be built for a weeks long Olympics event. The Olympics are a terrible investment and a huge risk. This past June, a presentation was given to a select group. I was part of this group.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Originally, I was part of the city designated pool advisory committee, but somehow I was not invited to this meeting in June. In this presentation was text about Olympic diving. The slide you've seen was taken at that presentation. Also in this presentation on page 17, a page titled Probable Path Forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It states reduce height by creating an outdoor pool with option to cover later. This is called segmentation or piece mealing, and it's illegal. Another missing design consideration in this pool plan is allocation for a first aid room. Recommended pool guidelines suggest a swimming pool with a surface water surface area in excess of 4000 square feet shall have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a readily accessible room designated and equipped for emergency care. The room shall have a cat sink telephone, including first aid kits and long spine boards with ties and collar and blankets for potential triage spaces for victims who need to be moved away from on lockers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where is the allocation for this first aid room? This is especially necessary with a diving area and a children's recreation area. Despite significant geological, environmental, financial obstacles. With this project in this location, city will not consider another location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The old pool building was demolished because it is on unstable ground. So how preposterous to build in the same location. Where will the money come from? Taxes. Bonds. Grants are sold off like the City Hall is a privately financed P3 project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With shrinking budgets. Are you going to allow general funds to be siphoned off to float a pool? These proposed plans are new build and they need a new IIR. No pool on the beach. I request my retain remaining time for rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next week, the. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vice mayor and council members. I'm Jeff Miller. I ask you to postpone or vote no on all of the items of this hearing? The second attempt to build the BBC. The first attempt three years ago ended when the Coastal Commission found fault with the proposal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The immediate problem is that you and the public have not been given all the information needed to make an informed decision. There are two significant gaps in information. First, the details of the second version of the BBC have been fully known only since they were presented at the Planning Commission meeting of December 19, 2019, just a month'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ago. Even then, the materials presented did not include some relevant data, such as the design renderings separate from the plan drawings, which you just saw in the presentation tonight. Some public comments were also omitted from the documents. I believe those items are still missing from what has been presented to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And second, the city has not answered the significant questions about this project. 22 of them asked by the Coastal Commission. Their approval of the project will not even begin to be considered until these questions have been satisfactorily answered.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This project seems to be shrouded in secrecy. The second version of the design has been produced and presented with almost no publicity and with no public outreach. Not one public meeting was held to present this design ahead of the December 19 Planning Commission meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Even though it has been touted as a citywide facility. The last public outreach meeting was in April 2016, and that was for the first version of the project, a totally different design. There was a secret presentation of this latest design to the BBA stakeholder committee last summer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From the beginning, there has been only one resident representative on that committee. That representative was intentionally excluded from that meeting. The proceedings of that meeting were not made public. This is not a citywide representation. The signage at the Belmont Park where the project would be built is incorrect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The four large billboards four feet tall by eight feet wide, are the illustrations and description of the four year old project. There is no picture or description of the current project. This new project was never presented to the city's own Marine Advisory Commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This commission meets monthly and is tasked with advising council on quote matters regarding city policies pertaining to marinas, beaches, waterways and near-shore areas, unquote. They had no meeting in December, but they did have one in January. This project has been portrayed as a replacement of an old pool.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is not. It's a new project, far greater in size and impact. It would be a replacement of a natural beach and park containing grass and mature trees, which have been enjoyed for the public by the public for six years now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is the baseline. A new E-R and approval process are required. It is not accurate or acceptable to claim. The second attempt is merely a revision of the first BBC, which was presented three years ago. At that time, two council members acknowledged it was a new project, not a replacement, and voted no.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now is that it is a different new project. The presentation at the Planning Commission meeting in December was basically a stealth action. It was scheduled at an extremely busy time for everyone in the middle of holiday activities guaranteed to minimize public awareness and participation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The meeting was announced, then canceled, then confusingly reinstated. The documents, images and exhibits presented at that meeting were not made available to the public until three days before the meeting. These included the air addendum of 865 pages. I challenge anyone to be able to even read, much less understand and prepare a response to all of the documents'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in three days. The ER addendum contains significant errors of fact. Here is only one example in the section describing traffic impacts. Quote The project site and surrounding area have not been further developed or altered since the 2016 certified air was prepared.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is no information in the administrative record or otherwise available that indicates that there are substantial changes in circumstances pertaining to transportation and traffic that would require major changes to the 2016 certified air, unquote. That is blatantly false.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since 2016, Ocean Boulevard in that area has been reduced from four lanes to two. The Olympics, now renamed Iconix Fitness Business, has opened with a large demand on parking. The beach in that area has undergone a large increase in usage in those intervening years by volleyball players, dog walkers, pedestrians, bicyclists and others.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also adding to parking and traffic demand. Changing the zoning to accommodate the extreme height of the structures, including the floodlight poles, is nothing but a trick. To mask this inappropriate height. And there's the question of money. The stated costs of this project have been nebulous.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The cost of additional design work has not been addressed. The operational and maintenance costs have not been detailed. And the Tidelands Fund. Money set aside is not really available if you want the city to be prepared for the 2028 Olympics.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The pier is the viewing site for the sailing events and it needs costly upgrades. And finally, there is sea level rise and increasing damaging storm surges. The sea can't be held back. Long Beach should be leading the effort to deal intelligently with sea level rise, not creating a problem for itself by proposing a new building on the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sand. The Coastal Commission will not look kindly on the attempt to ignore this problem and instead put an expensive facility on the sand vulnerable to an uncertain future. Please start now to plan and commit the funds to renovate the pier for the 2028 Olympics.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That will be something to be remembered for building a first class venue for the Olympic sailing events. Not the costly mistake of pursuing a flawed proposal. Please postpone this item or vote no. Don't approve this project now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seems to be a little bit longer. I hope you can hear me. Good evening, Vice Mayor Andrews. Council members, or is it? Good morning? I think not. But anyway. My name is Melinda Cotton. My husband and I have lived in Belmont Shore for more than 35 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're fortunate to live just a few blocks from the beach and have walked and bicycled the states. The city's enviable Long Beach the entire time. As temperatures rise, we see more and more people flocking to the beach to enjoy the bike and pedestrian paths soccer and volleyball, Rosie's dog beach, the surf and just playing in the sand'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and making sand castles since the old Belmont pool was demolished six years ago. Olympic Park Plaza Park has shined as a beautiful beachfront jewel with family picnics and group parties, people walking their dogs, young people partying and having improper, improper and impromptu soccer games on the nearby sandy beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The L.A. 28 Olympics Committee has liked the area so much, they've chosen the waters off the Belmont Pier for the Olympics competitive sailing events. This artist rendition of the sailing venue is telling for. When you look closely at the beachfront, you'll see in the Olympics picture no Belmont Pool complex.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The existing green treed Olympic Plaza Park is still there. The L.A. 28 official website shows swimming and diving events taking place at USC's baseball stadium. It's called Dado Field in downtown L.A., where they'll put in a large temporary pool, which you see in the artist's rendition and diving facilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The L.A. 28 game does have water polo water polo events in Long Beach. The site, a large temporary pool and stadium to be built in the elephant lot next to the convention center where other kinds of events will take place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is the same site the Coastal Commission and many others have strongly recommended for the BBC. Doesn't that tell you the elephant lot is the best place for a permanent new complex? That is, if the city can afford it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An expensive $85 million pool and diving complex is not needed in Belmont Shore. We already have and have had for six years an Olympic sized temporary pool that is slated to become permanent. It serves recreational swimmers and water polo players, provides lessons, aerobics and more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One must ask, does the third district need additional public pools and special diving facilities when only two other council districts in the city have public pools leaving six districts without? And that $85 million price tag that we heard talk about earlier, that $85 million price tag just for the BBC is daunting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The NY 20 city budget shows in the red less than $54 million set aside for the BBC complex that's out of the beaches and marinas $89 million total capital improvement fund shown in blue. And the funds set aside so far are at least 32 million less than the current pool estimate, with no information as to where those'",
        "'speaker_3': 'extra millions will come from. The Title IX Capital Improvement Fund also expects less than $3 million in new money this year and in years to come. And that's also in blue on that chart. Think of just a few of the titles unfunded needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know the crumbling Naples Sea still need for more repair phases. Phase two, which is now going on, is costing $15 million. That indicates another roughly $60 million for phase three through six. Again, unfunded. Public Works also says there's no money to rebuild.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 90 year old lifeguard headquarters on the beach or to appear on the council in 2015, recognized the elderly 1930 structure, needed rehab or replacement, paid for a study and architects. But no idea when that might happen. The junior lifeguard building did get approved and apparently will go under construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But don't we need a really up to date lifeguard headquarters building and marine safety and public safety by 2028 when we have the competition off the Belmont Pier. Yet the city has promised the 2028 Olympics Committee it will rebuild the Belmont Pier for the sailing competitions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it, too, is listed in the budget as an unfunded, unfunded, high priority. And the pier needs serious help, which was highlighted in 2017 when a storm to docks off the end of the pier landing on the beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, three years later, the pier still hasn't been fixed. The Marine Advisory Commission asked why at this month's meeting in early January and was told bids to replace the docks were coming in at two and a half million dollars and the city has only $900,000 in insurance available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were told, again, lack of funds is the key. And then there's continued climate change, sea level rise and global warming to plan for. The League of Women Voters held its sixth annual climate symposium at the Aquarium of the Pacific last Sunday with scientists detailing the seriousness of SLR, especially when combined with king tides, storm surge and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wave action which plagued the peninsula regularly. And on my street in Park Avenue, we have heavy rainstorms flooding the street and our garage. The Aquarium of the Pacific titled It's October Climate Change Event Coping with Sea Level Rise with a focus on Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As we all mature and peninsula. And as you see, this deluge is already happening in front of my house. I know this LV Post article from just a year ago, only last January, with floods inundating the Olympic Plaza dry where the Belmont Beach and Aquatics Center is to be built.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is this really smart? Shouldn't we be spending our limited tidelands and other funds on the critical needs noted above, rather than spending $8,085 million on an aquatic complex on the beach 100 feet from the surf? I think a lot of us would think the answer was no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them and thank you for your time. And if there's time left over, I might have comments after the report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. My name is Jim Hines. I'm a 30 year resident of Long Beach and a taxpayer. And this is my first process in the city council. So bear with me. But I hereby request, respectfully request that the City Council reject this application of the Belmont Beach and Aquatic Center as the item is presently written.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From a taxpayer perspective, I believe better analysis is the other stakeholders and other speakers have said is the make a sound decision is ordered is required to make a sound decision. Analysis should examine the city latest redesign relative to the days overall city investment needs, the strategic criteria, associated risk and funding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A comprehensive risk assessment should be made sure in best, most likely and worst case scenarios not just the initial investment, but also importantly, the operating support and maintenance costs. Question How likely will the center be completed in 85 million?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, is that not to exceed cost or is it a 5050 chance that the cost will be there? And who will who will bear the brunt of the overruns? What are the major concern? Risks, contingencies and associated costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From a finance standpoint, I'd like to see an S-curve. Taxpayers should be informed of the project risks relative to their requirements needs, not just wants. Ground rules and assumptions against total nonrecurring and reoccurring costs. Financial should also be reported both for public and private financial commitments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That far along, you should be getting the commitments and their likelihood firm upfront commitments should be obtained for the initial investment. But as well for the operating revenues before going forward. Olympic requirements seem to be the driving factor for the 85 million.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The question is, is what are the firm city commitments for the Olympics? You need to nail those down. Otherwise the requirements are a wish list or a want list. Well, relative to weather, what is needed? For example, we should know whether the Olympic cost drivers, the number and size of the pool, the driving force, the diving facilities'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we talked about, the associated costs and commitments. It seems that a few wants are driving a lot of the cost. Although vocal, the reality is a 50 meter pool, etc. is only used for competitive purposes and that only represents about 5% of the total population.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So from that, you know, other similar aquatic facilities without diving seem to cost anything about 15 to $30 million. And we know that UFC, you know, just spent $8 million to renovate their facility up there, too, with diving facilities, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that should be nailed down relative to who's doing what, when associated with the cost of this effort. Um. We hear a lot from the competitive swimming community, but where is their financial commitments? Taxpayers. With all that, the taxpayer shouldn't be the point and the burden that satisfy the special interests.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also were the swimming requirements coordinated and integrated with our local public school systems. To date, there seems to be little. Long Beach taxpayers are already paying for a $28 million Olympic sized pool for the Long Beach City College.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Long Beach tax payers are already, you know, are also paying, you know, 3 billion for Major K and major E for school upgrades and repairs and include new pools and pool upgrades. Cambria, Ohio, for example, has a new $12 million pool, reportedly because there's no public pools nearby.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Wear them or any of the Long Beach Unified School District, Long Beach C College or Cal State, Long Beach financial commitments to the pool. That lack of coordination doesn't and does not inspire taxpayer confidence. Up to 80% of the like the Aquatic Center Lysate because it's typically tied up in operation maintenance and support expenses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What is the project? Operating life with its probable operating maintenance and support cost. Is there a list of operating maintenance and support concerns or risk? What are the reserves? Is an operating and maintenance risk assessment being performed or the operating commitments he's made with the swimming, private, public and private organizations?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My understanding in Sacramento is when organizations stepped up to pay 70% of the operating costs or 70,000 per year of the operating costs, where's the commitments from these people that, you know, from these organizations are want these special requirements?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Which one of this according to the also according to the capital improvement process, you know, public works, financial management. Any possible end user department should have quantified anticipated name cost route for each council so they can have a detail and understand the costs and risk against future allocated budgets and to make an informed decision and such as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that being done. My personal benchmarking shows that cities with aquatic centers experienced net operating losses, some substantial rip up to billions of dollars. Again, council members and taxpayers need to understand the driving cost requirements and get a detailed breakdown of the probable operating costs, room routes, revenues and cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The taxpayer's concern is that the city does have a reputation of neglecting infrastructure. Look at our streets, sidewalks, public facilities with liability. Debt is up to 2.3 billion. And we're going to add new, new infrastructure on top of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What about the Queen Mary? The city has established criteria for capital improvements. Question is, does the aquatic center meet them? Does Aquatic Center address any city health, safety or legal concerns and mandates? Does the Aquatic Center prolong the life of the city asset or in minimizing future costs?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Repair costs? Can't be prolonged anymore. We need to reassess the needs to the to the current environment and the constraints. Is the aquatic center in the is long range strategic plan. Is there a city long strategic plan? Does the Aquatic Center secure will be able to secure future funds through programing, planning or grant eligibility versus its cause'",
        "'speaker_4': '? In summary, I asked, is the current needs and priority of the proposed Belmont Beach and Aquatic Center serve the average Long Beach taxpayer, especially, especially with the $2.3 billion liability and infrastructure. I then encourage careful consideration of the City Council regarding the financial realities of the proposed Belmont Beach and Aquatic Center project and in its existing requirements'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as they now stand. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I would like to take the opportunity to make a couple of comments in rebuttal. Obviously, there's a number of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want to do public first or rebuttal?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. Mr. Vice Mayor, it's appropriate to do public comment now and then. City staff, since they have the burden of proof, would have the opportunity to provide a rebuttal to anything that's been said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. So any public comment on this item? Would you please come forward?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have Khadijah Cager, Mel Nutter, Joseph. Griever and Joseph Slim and Anna Christiansen. Terry's daughter, Kim or O'Shay calls Lee and Cantrell, Lucy Johnson, Joe Weinstein, Katie Roll, Dr. Preston Smith, Dave Sugar and Keith Mason.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm in this. Can I clarify the amount of time that you're giving to the public speakers this evening? Agenda item, it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Over ten people, so we're kind of down. And their place. Seconds. You can go whenever you feel. Thank you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good morning. My name is Gordana Cager, and I'm an appellant on this pool to the Coastal Commission. My comments were filed earlier this week via email, and as most of you know, I am opposed to this pool. I'm so very grateful to those of you on the dais, along with your staff who were willing to meet with'",
        "'speaker_9': 'me this week. Thank you for listening, and thank you for listening to our concerns about this pool. There are so many unanswered questions that it's absolutely irresponsible to make a decision this evening. So I urge your no vote.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Coastal Commission has serious concerns and questions on this pool. City staff, I understand, has responded to the December 6th incomplete letter with a response this afternoon. Have you seen that information? You must have that information before making an informed decision.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And exactly how many public meetings were held in Long Beach about this project? Zero. One private meeting was held with the pool stakeholders in June of 2019. I urge you to consider the comments of Councilman Oranga, Coastal Commissioner Urunga, who pointed out significant issues on the first design in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This revised pool has not changed those issues. We will see you at the Coastal Commission. It will not be in February. It will not be in May. Maybe this year. Thank you for your time and please vote no.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm Bill Netter, and I'm here representing Gordana Cage, who.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appealed your.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Approval of a local.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Coastal development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Permit to the Coastal Commission back in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because the coastal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are because the city waived the time to hear the appeal, that appeal is still pending, and it's unclear what the city's position is relative to that pending appeal. But regardless, the proposed finding that the current proposed local coastal development permit is consistent with your certified LCP or local coastal program is false.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The fact that the staff proposes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seek certification of an amendment to the current LCP is proof that the city staff knows that that proposed finding is untrue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if you look.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the comments I made before the Planning Commission, I expanded upon that. The staff reports that the changes made to the project since 2017 could have been made in response to public input. That is not entirely accurate. The only public exposure to the proposed changes occurred at the Planning Commission hearing in December.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and have pointed out and I have a few other things to say, but I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my name's Joe Giaever, and I live in a third district. So, yeah, Mr. Mercola, for kind of an important piece out of the timeline there, and that's those appeals. So the several appeals from local residents were combined with a couple of appeals by the coastal commissioners, and those appeals are still pending.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not clear to me whether the city has ever informed the commission that you've got a new project on the same property and that old clip should probably be just rescinded and start over again. But despite all that. The revised pool has definitely been made smaller just to make it cheaper, I guess, but it doesn't resolve the issues'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in those appeals. So I don't know who the stakeholder advisory committee is, but it clearly doesn't include the appellants or probably the most important stakeholders, at least from a dispute resolution perspective. So two of the issues kind of go together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The idea of alternative sites for this pool and the and the prohibition on protective devices from sea level rise. So in the first of all, the the elephant line was considered. Last go round and eliminated because it was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I said, thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Much. She's okay. Um. Oh, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyway, I'm next by speakers, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was going to say good evening, but I think somebody was right when they said good morning. Thank you for your time and your stamina to stay awake and pay attention to these these comments. And we greatly appreciate your efforts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Kim O'Shay. I work for Southern California Swimming. Our offices are over in San Pedro and we represent over 20,000 swimmers who participate in competitive swimming across this area all the way over to Vegas. And our swimmers love to come to Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They love Long Beach. They love the history here. They love their experiences. Hopefully, many of you were able to look at some emails that you received earlier today from Olympians who participated in meets throughout history here in Belmont and phenomenal, phenomenal memories, sentimental value and success as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we're not only talking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About Olympic swimmers. Yes, it's a special interest group and we're very much into the competitive side of things. But we also want to applaud you for looking at cradle to grave programing for your community. Absolutely. To look at putting little kids into swim lessons to make them safer around the water because we are a beachfront community all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the way up through programing for senior citizens that want to lap, swim and stay healthy. So it's cradle to grave programing and it's a beautiful community service. We thank you for your time and we greatly appreciate your attention to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we would vote for a recommend voting for approval to uphold the Planning Commission's recommendation. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks, Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good morning. Dave Shukla, Third District. I both my brother and I were on the swim team at Long Beach Poly and from 1996 through 2002, we participated in the Moonlight Swim finals at the Belmont Pool. After his injury, after he became disabled, he did two years of physical therapy at the Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's an important institution. Having a city pool, a flagship institution, is important nonetheless. I. I oppose the project even as revised when it was approved in 2013. In February of 2013, that was the first City Council meeting I went to as an adult, and there were hundreds of people here in the afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Through the evening. The offshore clinics was here, but not here next door, but they were in the city council chambers and they were engaged. It's the dead of night. What are we doing? What are you doing tonight? The appellants are going to start.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whatever merits you think their arguments have. They are going to continue. And the one issue that I have specifically with this project is that. It's a built structure that's going to last 60 to 80 years. Sea level rise is something that we're increasingly learning is coming sooner and faster and harder than we expected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It would be a horrible symbol for the city to take tidelands funds and not think of how the lifecycle of those funds has been used and what that flagship actually works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Terry Stoddard. I'm the general chairman for Southern California Swimming. And as Kim has mentioned, I'm here representing over 20,000 registered athletes, 800 coaches and over 150 clubs and 250 officials that have been through the process of using Belmont's pool in the past.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Myself, I swear on my last national championship there and 15 years later I was able to win a national championship as a team. But more importantly, as my daughters then were able to compete in a massive championship and also for their their college and a four year school.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the whole process went through. And now, as my grandkids are beginning to learn how to swim at age six, four and ten months, they're looking for facilities like this. But my players applause an iconic. Pool that goes straight to the memories of learning to swim, have the opportunity for competition on weekends, but have the ability to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have fitness throughout the time. Eight people die from drowning every day. Having this in a coastal community is going to give us the opportunity to avoid that, and it's going to be able to reach out not to only the communities of Long Beach, but the surrounding communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We urge you to continue your support of revitalizing this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Could you please call the next speakers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Joseph Silverman. Anna Christianson. Corey Leslie. And Cantrell. Lucy Johnson. Joe Weinstein. Katie Roe. Dr. Preston Smith. Keith Mason.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please come.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, please. Come on. Other names as you call, as you please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Coming up, Joseph slamming Anna Kristiansen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the name of the bride.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. Fine. Thank you. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if she wants it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, we can't do that, too.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think keep doing it that last time on the clock. You have Lieberman's points. I'm not going to reread them. Okay. But I am also speaking for Lieberman, the BBC. Move it or lose it. Build it downtown on the elephant lot or some other location where more residents, especially low income people of color, are likely to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'use it. How and where we build our municipal pools reflects a pattern, reveals a pattern of race and class prejudice. Olympic sized pools in the wealthy, white, south east corner and too small. Jim Crow, I'm quoting a gentleman who wrote about contested waters, the history of swimming pools in low income neighborhoods for people of color.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'BBC. Both boosters, as you see here tonight, invoke nostalgia, insisting that our former Belmont Power will be rebuilt in the same location while also demanding to make it bigger and better. And we know that 16 of those 17 stakeholders are either representing sports teams or for profit businesses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A state of the art facility for competitive and for profit owners will not reverse the high risk of drowning faced by the majority of youth in Long Beach. We are a 70 plus percent minority community nationwide. 40% of white youth and 60 to 70% of youth of color do not learn to swim and are more likely to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'drown. All residents are expected to share the $85 million cost some will be paying with their lives and the communities. Prioritize public health, safety and recreation. Let's plan accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I am cautiously and I'm opposed to this agenda item. I have no issue with building a pool and but I do have objections to the location and specifically with the risk associated with that location and also with the cost.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The risk once again, is the sea level rise and placement on the sand where liquefaction and earthquakes can cause another a loss of our of our pool. There's also poor public access in that location. It's way over in the corner of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're using precious tidelands funds that in and of themselves will not cover the scaled back design that is lacking a roof and will very obviously be a money pit for maintenance. And now about the cost. Why is it that Torrance can produce a public swimming facility for $15 million?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Santa monica built a pool on the beach in 2009 for 27.5 million. With the additional listed amenities a rec room, the swimming pool, a splash pad, beach volleyball, tennis courts, soccer fields, canopies, a cafe, rentals for paddleboards all that for 27.5 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Why are we paying 87 or 85? Whatever it is? Less than a third of the price of the Belmont Pool is how they did it in Santa monica. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Salmon. Why Skip doing that? Good morning. In control. And I agree with everything that's been said. I'm asking you to either vote no or postpone this. I'm speaking for carp. I we sent you a letter. I want to reiterate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You're being asked to approve an addendum for the Environmental Impact Report that was approved for a completely different site plan and location. Removing the roof from the previous pool. Adding a kids fan zone. Moving the project, taking out a park and public ride away are all significant changes to the original site plan and EIA are the additional'",
        "'speaker_9': 'impacts of noise, light, traffic and parking have not been adequately studied nor mitigated. The city manager tells you there's no problem, but there's not been any studies. The new project must have a new IIR. Carp has never opposed a pool.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have opposed the location. And this location is flawed. The elephant lot. There's no proof that it has in greater danger from sea level rise than the current location. I would like to see a study that shows this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. I'm Joe Weinstein, and I sent you the other letter from Karp. What's at stake is not merely making the right decision about a pool.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You've been presented you've been presented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A project which proposes to spend at least four times much as much as is necessary to produce a full fledged aquatic center. Karp supports the idea of a multipurpose aquatic center. We don't support the proposed squander. These proposals would have us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. Thanks to the choice of the absurd choice. Based solely on nostalgia, but needless and foolish and almost about the worst possible sight. Belmont Park has a beach. Thanks to this, you have a recipe for squander. And you think this is just about a pool project about aquatics?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I'm afraid not. These proposals will damage not only city finances, but the public career of every official that votes for them. Because you declared a fiscal emergency and you want a permanent sales tax. And when you approve these proposals for squander, you are sending a very clear message that people are going to continue to reiterate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Namely, you want the tax revenue in order to squander it. Squander is not okay even if you get other sources of revenue, because think of a philanthropist as a philanthropist, want to enable you to make you have to spend more in order to get less.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's essentially the message you'd be sending to a philanthropist. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is Lucy Johnson still here? Katie Role. Dr. Preston Smith. And Keith Mason.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Dr. Preston Smith. I admire your your ability to take this. I have a difficulty opposing the pool since I was a swimmer in high school at USC. But I've also spent 45 years studying the beach and its processes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for that reason, I have two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Reasons why I oppose it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One is the costs. The money should be set aside for use of protecting property. We already have problems in Naples and the peninsula. We need we need to protect the property that we do have. One thing that hasn't been mentioned is in 1939, we had a hurricane caused by warm water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have warming water and much more of a chance of hurricane men. If we look at history, will see that this area was under water in the thirties and then there's a sea wall running along the back of the of the parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You also had storms in the late thirties. We have signs of erosion now. And I have a letter from demonstration to the Army Corps of Engineers stating that we had. 114 feet of the recession in during a two hour, two month period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for all the reasons, I think it's a very dangerous place to put the pool. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Doctor. Next we go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Keith Mason. I live in the third district on the I regularly use the temporary pool that's there. I'd like to see something done with the pool in that area. I don't know that we need to pools. I don't know that $80 million is the right amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it certainly would be nice to have something in that area that was used a lot today, and I think it would be a real detriment to the community to not do something like that. So with only 30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I came yesterday to the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next week. You?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is Lucy Johnson still here? Carrie Row. That's the end of our speaker's list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think, you know, the answer comes from the Council on Price. Is that it, or what do we know?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We have this as an opportunity for a short rebuttal, if necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a time when energy just.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there anyone who like I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, we would like to provide some brief rebuttal. Those were a lot of comments. There's needless to say, there's a number of things that we disagree with. I will focus on the the large ones and do the mostly in chronological order.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So forgive me for this being a little disjointed. There was a comment about that there no access for fire lanes or oversize vehicles. The facilities for were designed with fire lanes and the ability to turn around any type of oversize vehicles that are necessary.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was a comment about that. We need to armor the building that is not correct or that sand replenishment is required and that is armoring. That is also not correct. We had originally contemplated sand replenishment but with the new design, since we aren't impacted by sea level at all because we moved out of the sea level plane'",
        "'speaker_7': 'as requested by coastal, that is not required. There were a number of comments about how the information was shared. I do want to point out that when we were first contemplating a redesign back in June, we of 2019, we created our stakeholder committee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We brought them to. I'm sorry. Didn't create them. We reactivated them and brought them together and shared information about the project we did at that time. Take a little bit different approach because on that stakeholder committee was also an individual and others who had sued the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so because of that legal action, we actually did still provide the information. We just did it in a different forum. So they got phone calls from me and we shared the same information. We just did it in two different forums.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also then provided information before we came to Planning Commission on December 3rd and writing so that everybody had the new design. The discussion back in June was high level concepts, and then we provided a new design on the 13th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then went to Planning Commission on the 19th. That was a major public meeting. You have the public meeting today where there's additional input for everyone to be here. And it's well attended, obviously. And we also have an opportunity, a coastal commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there was a comment that we are proposing a cover that is not correct. That was an initial part of a discussion with the stakeholders and could we may be consider recover. We did not put that in after getting some stakeholder input.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The project will be designed so that we could add one in the future, but that would be a completely separate project going through all the separate entitlements and separate air if future councils ever want to do that. There was a question about the notice of incomplete application from the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They did send us 22 different questions about our response that we submitted back in, I believe, November. We have submitted to that as of today. We'd be happy to share that with anyone who wants to see it. It's a seven page response.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Frankly, doesn't affect what we're doing here tonight because that's addressing a different jurisdictions issues. They're different than than the ones that we have here tonight. But we can certainly make that available to anyone who wants it. Do you want to respond to the cost as that has been brought up?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When we talk about $85 million, that is a total budget figure and it's actually pretty comprehensive. It's kind of soup to nuts on the project. It even includes the cost of demolition of the facility of the old one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we wanted to provide the council on our fiscal policies, not just the construction cost, but the full cost of the entire project, including soft costs, design costs and the demolition. And so whenever we talk about that 85 million, that's what's included there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I did want to clarify that. So when you're comparing this to other projects, a lot of times that you'll read about it in the paper, that'll be the construction cost of the facility. Our construction cost is significantly less than $85 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was a comment that we had promised the Olympic Committee to rebuild the pier. That is incorrect. There isn't you. Yeah. They're not asking us to rebuild the premier and the pier. That is a separate project that we're visioning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that is not a requirement. We also had been asked about maintenance and operating costs, as have been estimated. We started that when the council first entertained this project back in 2014. We got permission to move ahead knowing that there were maintenance and operating costs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Frankly, this project has gone through so many different changes. That is all going to be updated after we get an entitlement and then the council will make a decision whether you want to move forward. Once you have the entitlements, that's one thing you still are going to make a decision whether you want to fund this project or'",
        "'speaker_7': 'move forward. And our fiscal policies say we're going to go through all of the costs, both capital and operating and maintenance when you make that decision. There was also comments that we should not be spending city taxpayer dollars on this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to remind everybody, this is not the general fund. These are not your property tax dollars or sales tax dollars that go to this project. These are specific funds funded in the Tidelands, funded mostly out of transfer from the Port of Long Beach and oil operating dollars that are funding this project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oil dollars and dollars from oil recovery. These are not tax dollars in the in the normal sense of the word. And then finally, there was a question about the appeals and what the status of those are. We are in constant communication with the Coastal Commission staff on this project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's been that way since we first proposed this project. We have talked to them about staying our appeal so that we could go through this process. All of those appeals will be heard at the same time. You know, Coast to Wall is holding everything so that at the meeting that they are planning to have, everything will be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'discussed. Everyone will have a chance to come. We expect that to be very, very well attended. If you'll notice, there were not a lot of supporters here, and they all are. A lot of them went home and then let the council member talk to that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But also they all know that, you know, everyone's going to come out and really talk about this at the Coastal Commission because that really is the the final body making the final decision. So if I turn to staff today, miss anything critical.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think correct to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Factual items in the record. In Ms.. Miller's presentation, there was a comment that this was somehow inconsistent with the city's climate action plan. The city is working on a climate action plan, but there is no draft, much less any adopted plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's no way for this to be inconsistent with that. And there were multiple references to the Olympic Games. Just to clarify what's in front of the council. No agreement what the Olympics is in front of the council at this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is the land use entitlements that are in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Front of you for the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Permanent structures at the site. Any temporary activities for the Olympics would be subject to a separate item that would come in front of this council. And those items are exempt from sequel under a different section of law at square guidelines 15272.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that, there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Were many items brought up, but just to correct those items on the record.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we have our full team here. We have anything from our environmental consultants to our project delivery team to our project manager, and we are available to answer any of your questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Price, would you like to? I'm sorry about that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin. So I want to thank everyone for staying, especially the appellants and the public that came out to speak. I know it's been a late night and I really appreciate the fact that everyone stayed and I appreciate everyone's input.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to thank staff for working very hard on this project for as long as they have. It's great to see how far this project has come. It's taken us a long time to get to this point, and I think we've had a lot of investment from our city council in educating themselves about the project and learning'",
        "'speaker_5': 'about it and really understanding the issues. We've heard input from residents city wide on how the project can best be possible and has. We've included lots of amazing amenities as a result of comments directly from my council colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The last time this item was before us. Whether it's a competitive swimmer, toddlers or seniors, the amount of recreational activities and opportunities to use the space has been enhanced as a result of this redesign. So I think staff are taking to heart the comments made by my council colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The last time this item came forward. This will be truly a pool that anyone can enjoy and it will increase access to the coastal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Area for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Residents throughout the city. I think that the changes that have been made to the facility make it less intrusive and more feasible for us to construct, which I appreciate. The height has been greatly reduced, which I know was a concern of some of my colleagues, and the design changes have reoriented the property to reduce the impacts on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the beach. I will say, and I have said this over and over again, this pool has been designed with sea level rise in mind when we're talking about sea level. I am far more concerned about the hundreds of homes and the thousands of people who live around this facility whose homes have not been designed for sea level'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Rise like this property has. Are this the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Proposed design has? We did have a large group earlier today, if I may inquire of staff, how many letters of support and opposition we received.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I received a total of nearly 300 comments. I believe approximately 250 were in support and we've had the remainder were in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you for that. And I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The folks who took the time to write letters, because I know I knew tonight was going to be a very long night. And in the past, we've had a lot of youth who are interested in swimming attend the meeting tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And with the SDR item, I knew that the earliest we would get to them would be 10 p.m., so I'm glad that they didn't come for that. We talk a lot about I know the opponents talk a lot about the best use of tidelands moneys and I have talked with some of them in the past for the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'beach path, for example. Some felt that that was a waste of tidelands money. And I understand that. And while I appreciate those concerns, I don't share them. I believe that engaging our coastal spaces and activating them has been a positive benefit for the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm very, very much looking forward to continuing to do that. I would love to have swimming pools in every district in the city. I really would. And if the decision today was whether or not we're going to fund a pool with $85 million of general fund dollars, I probably would not be supporting that project because our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'biggest projects right now and from a citywide level are our street infrastructure, our public safety. And if we had $85 million of general fund moneys to play with, I think building a pool would not be anybody's top priority.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are using money that's restricted in terms of where it can be used. And I think that it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The void of the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pool is felt by many. I heard the opponents speak tonight about the use of that property, but I will say from the residents who live around that facility, the businesses who operate businesses right around that facility, that the void of the pool is felt very strongly every day, while on occasion you might see families picnicking in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'area. We often do see also encampments, a lot of areas that are not maintained and a lot of non activation of the space that has deteriorated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The general use of that space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that's I think when we talk about pools throughout the city, the only pool on the east side of Long Beach is a temporary one. In Belmont Shore, we have no permanent pools. And the east side of Long Beach, we do have two public pools, but they are located in exactly the areas that some of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'opponents suggested.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We built.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Additional pools. And so I'm all in favor of building more pools. But in terms of this project, I ask for my colleagues support and I do want to commend staff because they've been working very closely with Coastal Commission staff to get us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And will there be changes and modifications made along the way? Absolutely. But staff has worked and earnestly with Coastal Commission to try to get to a place where we have some meeting of the minds. And I want to thank our staff, our entire staff for the excellent work that they've done and for allowing me to carry on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this project that was really started by my predecessor and Assemblyman O'Donnell and Councilwoman Lowenthal, who were all very supportive of this. And I carry the torch forward on their behalf as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Suber No.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I wanted to cover a point. Tom McCann actually covered it, but a few speakers did bring it up and that was about the 2017 appeal and their questions. Would that be rescinded? Would it be dismissed without prejudice?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think Tom could explain that. That will be addressed by the Coastal Commission along with everything else. So it's kind of an aggregate of of both appeals. I think that. The other point that Tom Marcum made was that this is not the final decision on this in terms of the council in the funding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Mr. Murdoch, if you could just repeat what you said in that point, I think it's important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So before we can even get to that funding decision, you have to have an entitled project. So you're one part of that coastal commission will make a decision on the on the final entitlements. You may have to come back and actually tweak things depending on what they're what their actions were.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But then, more importantly, you would need to give us direction on should we move forward with, you know, getting to 100% construction drawings, bidding the project and then ultimately deciding on whether or not we should fund the project and actually start the construction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there are still several steps ahead of the council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I'll be short. Looking at the hour, I. I was, I think, one of the one or two council members here in 2014 when this first came before us. I can remember the meeting like yesterday. I can remember my mindset going into that meeting, but then also being influenced by a lot of people who who utilize'",
        "'speaker_6': 'our pools and what the Belmont pool really and understanding what the Belmont Pool really meant to so many people in this city and not just in the third district, but from for those across the city. Recently had a an experience where we had our niece's staying with us during the Christmas holiday and they stayed about a week'",
        "'speaker_6': '. One is a competitive swimmer at the University of Pacific. The other is going to be a water polo sensation in Long Beach State next year. But during their time with us, they were looking for a place to work out because they're competitive athletes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They needed to to work out. And so I gave them my car keys and said, go down to the Belmont pool, you can the temporary pool. And they loved it. There was a perfect experience for them. And so I think we sometimes take for granted the resources that we provide and can provide as a city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this I got to say, I'm really delighted to see the cost of this project scaled down significantly. And I think that that has that can't be overlooked. You know, you go from a $140 million project to an $85 million project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's the direction I want to see. Because when we first. This project was first proposed, I think it was a $60 million project. Then it started escalating up the other way. And so I commend staff and everybody involved for getting us to a place that, yeah, 80 million plus is expensive, but it's, it's way more reasonable than'",
        "'speaker_6': 'where we were headed. And so and the design changes I think are are definitely consistent and reasonable as well. I did have a question regarding just the little nuance of detail, 25 yards versus 25 meters. Can you explain that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So while most of us with a calculator realize that's not very much distance, it means a whole lot to the poor community. So certain groups swim 25 yards, you know, and this is just the width of the pool.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's 50 meters. Is the is the normal size of the pool. It allows you to do more collegiate type of practice on the 25 yards width, 25 meters is a little bit longer. And that is what is considered a fully Olympic pool.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So not many people swim 25 meters, but it allows more water polo to be done with floating goals, which is important to the water and community, water polo community. And it allows you to have what's called a fast core.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's a little bit of distance, but it does make a big difference to the to the swimming community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate that. That note of clarification. Again, I want to thank everybody who's been involved in this. What we're voting on tonight is moving this to the Coastal Commission. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. I will be supportive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fine. Thank you. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes? I forgot to ask that staff make a change in the design that we change it from a 25 yard with to a 25 meter width pool and that we we consider that change as part of our design element.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. So we're considering that to be part of the motion. And we've done all the environmental study to allow that it's included in the air and we've done some additional outreach and staff is very comfortable with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you for the direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm so impressed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. I want to thank the appellants that showed up today and the community members that have been involved in this process. And 2017 I issued my concerns on this item was not here, but issued a lengthy letter that I know was submitted as well, and the Coastal Commission had access to that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My concerns are voiced. I have some questions that I'd like to ask and understanding that this is putting it to the Coastal Commission. With this design, obviously support a smaller design. My first question is around the Climate Action Adaptation Plan, and it was stated by staff that we have not yet adopted one.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My gut reaction. And I and I know that the votes aren't there for tonight, but my gut reaction is to say we should we should stop considering a poll until we have a climate adaptation plan. But I know that that's not where we're going to end up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But that's that's my gut response. Could staff walk through for me two pieces? One is, what is the timing on the cap and two out of Thailand funds? And I know we're not talking about funding it today, but just so we know as we're moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Are there things in the cap that are proposed right now that Thailand funds could be used for to protect against sea level rise and some of the other issues that that are a priority for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Perez. So we're about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A little under a year out of completing the Climate Action and adaptation plan for this city site. Then we'll go to the Coastal Commission. Average turnaround for items at the Coastal Commission right now is in excess of a year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we're talking, you know, 24 months before being fully complete, the hold up on the Climate Action Plan has nothing to do with sort of this topic of sea level rise. That has to do with the greenhouse gas reduction side and finding sufficient greenhouse gas reductions for the city within the city's existing fiscal and logistical constraints.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. I don't want to go too far astray and end up in brown at all. But we can, you know, provide you an update on the Climate Action Plan under a separate cover, but its completion is not imminent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'll answer the Tidelands questions of all of our projects in the city, the ones that get the most scrutiny from a climate perspective and sea level rise perspective and all of those things are the projects in the coast that is pretty clear set out by the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They expect that, they ask for that. We look at every single adaptation there and the main idea is retreat. So wherever you can, they're not looking to armor or prevent sea level rise. They're looking to basically get out of the way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's exactly what we're doing with this project. We have retreated completely out of the 2100 sea level rise projection, and we do that with just about every project along the coast. We look at climate impacts.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I can't believe for 24 months out of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having a cap.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We had a presentation like a year ago. I know this is not the agenda item, but I am just. Really surprised because I thought from my conversations with development services that we were looking at this early in this year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I am I'm very surprised that we're two years out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We and to clarify, we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do expect to have a TFP to you in the next 30 or so days. On the cap.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are within a major milestone of, as I said, completing our local adoption over the next 12 months. But it does have to go to the Coastal Commission and to our great frustration. But nonetheless it's taking in excess of a year for the Coastal Commission to process our items.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's heartbreaking. I feel like climate change, like we always say it should be, it is the ultimate crisis and yet it takes us so, so long to go through this process. So, I mean, there are some things that we can talk about at a later date that I want to tease out necessarily.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I'm very interested in looking at even proposed items in the coast that are geared towards protecting our environment and thinking about climate change and thinking about how we offset supporting the poor while being able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Can we also really invest in some of these focus on climate change? Because we've done a lot on tourism already, I think all of the nodes. And so this is just a public way for us to start that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I know that you guys mentioned it. The cost has come down. Any additional fundraising that is being looked at now that the cost is lower or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So there are two main aspects that we'll be looking for for those funding. One, we do want to approach the Olympics Committee. We're a ways away from actually getting a commitment on Olympic diving to this point. All of the facilities that they've looked at, there really aren't any additional cost to the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This would be one where we are creating a facility where one does not currently exist. So we think there's a good opportunity to talk to them about funding. We are also looking at doing some fundraising and some marketing and sponsorship.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a big asset. It's going to be right in the Olympic area in 2028 and we believe there is some potential for some tasteful sponsorship of a naming rights for the facility, and then we would look at any other ways to close the gap.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's a much more manageable gap to close than before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So would you like to keep up again?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just have one quick thing, but yeah, I can queue up again. That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now you go ahead if you have one quick go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'On the you mentioned naming rights. I just want to make sure that the staff brings forward a agenda item about how we do naming rights before we get to that point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, that would be for council approval. We did a exercise about a year and a half ago where we just understood the feasibility of it. Before anything really gets done, the council will have to adapt that and blessed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to be nearing the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I see nobody else queued up so I could to make it short because it is late, as you tell my wife, that if I get home after. After Colbert put the APB on me. Colbert belonged on finished of the standard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A review that we have here is the standard of review that we have for this project here. The standard of review that we had in 2017 with a whole lot different. And it was a different project. And at that time I brought that up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There were a lot of issues that were involved with that project at that time. So that we're right that we're right up here, that some changes have been made. We'll talk about heights and a few shades and and sea level rise was a big one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then. And so the long story short, I didn't vote for that project. But we I said, anyway, it went forward to the Coastal Commission knowing that the Coastal Commission has a different standard of review. And that and that has been going on, I'm guessing, for the last two years, year and a half, where staff has been'",
        "'speaker_2': 'meeting with a close commission staff to talk about some of those concerns that were raised back in 2017. Height and sheds and sea level rise. So the project comes here. Now we have a different a different standard to review today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From my point of view, this area that we have here today is satisfactory. You addressed a lot of the issues that were brought up in 2017, which in my opinion is enough to move the project forward to the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That having seen that, there's still going to be another standard of review again by the Coastal Commission, which is going to be, I think a little more. Scrutinize it a little harder. Going to be a little bit more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More. Critical as to what's going to be presented. And I think the challenge is that here the challenges with costs commission, I think you understand it and I think it's going to be also a challenge that the commission knows very well about sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You said a key word there, kind of a managed retreat there had to do managed retreat because they're already back. But that's another issue that the Coastal Commission is dealing with every month in terms of managed retreat. We had a whole workshop on a managed retreat and sea level rise where a lot of cities are not as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'positioned as we are, where they're really encountering some really serious erosion along the cliffs, in their bluffs to where there's there's going to be some serious decisions being made for them next 20 to 30 years. What are they going to do with those those homes where they can't retreat anymore?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, they're done that. What's what's going to happen? People who have made investments for their families and I mean a. Sure you say a house with a great view of the beach. But that's going to be gone within the next 20 or 30 years because of sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No rate is going faster than we thought we were thinking at first it was going to be about six feet. But by 2001. 100, but it's going to be actually looking. Projections are more like ten feet, which is going to be a massive impact not only for here for us, but around the world, obviously, and everywhere else'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So what I want to do, what I want to basically push forward is that this is a different project now. The standard reviews is much different. The standard review that the Commission is going to look at is going to be different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that step has already been challenged with that. I know that you have been asked to provide additional information, some additional challenges being put forward to you to to meet so that when it comes to the commission or when it is adopted an agenda, it is pretty much the the plan that that you want to go'",
        "'speaker_2': 'forward with. I don't think this is the end of this discussion. I think there's going to be some war on on this project because obviously, I think there are still some some issues we need to take care of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have to look at, and especially when we're talking about, you know, environmental justice issues with having access to the beach. We talked we had a big discussion earlier tonight about affordable accommodations and Sterling's short term rentals. So, I mean, it's all that it's all it's all related.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's all related. And we'll be dealing with those when they come to us. So I'm going to be supporting moving forward to the Coastal Commission because I think that the standard review there will be much more much more difficult.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason, much more challenging.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, thank you. See? No more comments from anyone. Please take the vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ocean Cay.'"
