    "Report from Metro on the Blue Line Improvement Project.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. Next, we're going to move on to item 19 with the clock, please. Regarding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Item 19 is communication from Mir Garcia. Recommendation to receive and file report from Metro on the status of the Blue Line Improvement Project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. The only public coming on as well. Okay. I'm going to turn it up. Please turn over to Metro, please. Excuse me. It's good. I'm going to turn to Metro and then we'll have the comments after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, sir.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Uh, well, my name is Tim Lindholm. I'm the executive officer for Capital Projects at Metro. And wow, that's a tough act to follow, but thank you for having us here, Vice Mayor Andrews and members of the Council, we're really happy to be here to tell you about the new Blue Project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've got a lot of my team members here that are going to help walk through this presentation. I'll handle the first slide and then pass it on. So our beloved blue line is 29 years old and in the end are loving care.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we really need to get it into a state of good repair again so that it can be reliable and resilient and provide good passenger service. So what we're doing is we're investing $350 million on improvements to the blue line to enhance safety, increase reliability, and improve the customer experience for our passengers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're going to start the new blue improvements this Saturday morning at about 4 a.m.. We're going to start the southern closure of the the blue line so that we can start the work we're planning to do, which improvements in general are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're improving all of the overhead power systems, all new track work in the city of Long Beach, new signaling systems. We're modernizing the train control system. Very importantly, we're putting in four new crossover tracks which will allow us to switch tracks in case there's issues along the tracks or an accident or an incursion into the track.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That way we can pass it very quickly and keep our schedule. And it's also going to help with maintenance going forward that we have a way to get around areas where we're maintaining. We're also painting all the stations, putting in new signage and branding, and we're putting in digital map cases at every station which kind of look'",
        "'speaker_7': 'like big enlarged iPhones that are interactive. And you can do trip planner and you can find out when your train is coming. So the nature of the work that we're doing requires that the blue line be out of service for two extended four month closures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're going to close the south half from the downtown Long Beach Transit Mall to Willowbrook, Rosa Parks. We're going to work there for four months while the north portion is open and then we're going to switch. Once we're open on the south side, we'll close the north side and take care of that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, we're very cognizant that this is a major inconvenience to our passengers. And the success of this program is not whether we finish it on time or finish it within our budget. The success here is not to lose any riders, and to that we want to provide excellent passenger service as we do these closures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we've designed three levels of bus shuttle service, which Metro will talk about in the next couple of slides. The shuttle services are really based on on what we see, what we know our passengers do. Ridership patterns that we observe, origins and destinations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're trying our best to provide a shuttle service that will work for our passengers. So with that, I am going to do the project manager, James Way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Tim. Hello. My name is James William, the Pies manager for the Blue Line. Work we have shown here is a high level schedule, a time line we have for the works. Coming up, we talked about the Rosa Parks station and the North and South segment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Rosa Parks station will be closed throughout starting this Friday and Saturday coming up. And that goes on for eight months. And we do the work from south portion for everything south of Rosa Parks Station that goes all the way down to downtown Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This works. Expect to go on and goes into May and then while the train is running in the north segment, this will ends in May once we make a flip. As far as doing the work and North, we open its revenue service in the south and sometime late May another four month closure to that and within the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'north segments there's really broken up excuse me into two segments. So there's a most northern portion downtown L.A. where the tunnel is, seven metro station out to PICO, this portion of track, that expo and Blue Post shared three tracks together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That portion. We're going to do this work as fast as we can to replace track, work and Oasis, which is all we have power lines in that segment, and 45 days closure. And then after that, we open up the Expo Line, running the Blue Line, everything South Pico Station, starting from Grand Station, still close all the way'",
        "'speaker_9': 'down to Willowbrook and that's expected to be finished by September. Everything be done. And let me just go into a little bit more detail on the work that's going to occur in Long Beach. Starts again, starts this weekend.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's broken up into two major work as truck work and overhead power system work essentially will have two two group of contractors and workers working together, chasing each other out to start with. Well, you'll see what I mean by chasing each other.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The truck work starts first. This work starts in a long beach loop area. Everything south of a street for three or four weeks. This work continue. It's going to happen every day, Monday through Saturday. Sundays right now is plan to be off for the workers and also maybe a contingency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The work occurs day on weekends. The everything within between the crossings. Those are going to be on Monday to Friday work. And at the crossing where the street crosses our track, that's a Friday night, Saturday into Sunday work contractors planning doing that 24 hour straight starting Friday night and get this work done so on Sunday although it's'",
        "'speaker_9': 'not a planned work that that's the time where we're going to put new concrete at the track bed with where the street crosses the track will allow that time for concrete a cure. So this work truck work mainly it's going to happen essentially every day, seven days a week.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We do it every everything. We get work done with an hour with the time we have now once this work gets done. But first, as I mentioned, 3 to 4 weeks, the contract to start moving north, north of a street, going up to Willow Station and right behind it is overhead power system work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So overhead power system workers start about six week into the job contract to start working in the Long Beach Loop area. They're replacing all their contact wires entirely. Just just like the track track is getting replaced 100%. So these contact wires, essentially, they're 30 years old and they went out over the years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's time to replace them. So this work starts south again, going north, going toward north, chasing that group of track guys. So the track will be done after 12 weeks. And then also the cost, the overhead power work continued north.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It will be finish within that. They started a six, seven weeks. They also finished total about six, seven weeks. So that take us to about three months or so. The work is scheduled to be done within 12 weeks, plus or minus a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the rest of the time they're shut down. Metros are performing basically system integration test. This is to make sure that all the work is done correctly and adjustment needs to be make is done at this time. So this and the work obviously continue all the way to Willowbrook, not just City of Long Beach goes further and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'beyond. So the last three or four weeks of time, Metro will be performing tests and that's where you will see you may see non-revenue train running for testing the system that we put in. That covers most of the work as you go on Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Next thing I think we'll have Jeffrey here to talk about the bus replacement service.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Blue line service will be maintained from.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Seventh Street Metro Station to 103rd.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Street Station. Rail service will be suspended from 100 south of 103rd.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Street Station to downtown Long.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Beach, where it will be replaced by three levels of bus shuttle service.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Willowbrook Rosa Parks Station will be out for the entirety of the project, but we have four minute service to to for the folks who are transferred from the green line and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Want to transfer over to the blue line. Next, I'll speak to the local.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Shuttle, which is based off of demonstrated to me is to provide service to all of the closed stations. It's free of charge. And it will operate almost 24 hours a day. Service begins at 330 and extended through all the way through to 30, and that was.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Due to response to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Public outcry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It'll provide six minute service in the peaks in 12 minutes, service in the base.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So in the middle of the day, that's.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What the base period is. Next we have the Express shuttle.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These are for the folks who actually have demonstrated to me that they want to go from downtown Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles. So they'll bypass the middle of the segment and be expedited straight to the end of the line.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is provided during the peaks. We've actually expanded the peak period again due to public comments. So we.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Expanded it from 6.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To 530, and the back end from 9:00 to 955 is just displayed above.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the peak was also expanded from 3 to 7:30 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In a provide 12 minute service as well. The last shuttle is that is the select shuttle. And this is for the folks who demonstrated demand to go from downtown, from Long Beach, excuse me, to the green line and eventually connect over.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To the blue line.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, this would be a service that's offered during our peak periods. It is on a 12 minute headway. The composite headway for launch is about 4 minutes. So from Wardlow to downtown, Long Beach will be providing 4 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Over the entirety.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And next, I have Anthony Crump speak to our community outreach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening. Anthony Crump, director of Community Contractual Relations for Metro. I think last time that I was here, we gave you a brief overview of the outreach that we intended to do, but we didn't have a lot of details as we were still working with our service planning to to come up with the replacement bus service and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'some of the other details associated with the closure. Since then, I can say that we've done an extensive outreach program to let both our customers know, as well as residents in the general area know about the closure itself.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This began in earnest in July of last year and then gradually ramped up to culminate in in January of this year with an outreach program, a media program, and actually ambassadors at each of our stations talking about the closure itself.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Specific to the city of Long Beach, we actually sent a mailer out that looks like this is to take one that went to all residents within a half mile of the blue line itself. And that actually actually included also the cities of Los Angeles and Compton.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But everyone should have received this just after the New Years. And we also worked with the local council offices, committee organizations, business organizations like the DOJ to get the word out as well. Obviously, recognizing that we are not experts on the city of Long Beach and the neighborhoods associated with Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We really did leverage our relationships with community organizations and with the council members to get the word out and to use their newsletters and other means to reach out to them. The last bit of it was actually hitting high frequency areas where our writers potentially go to, and those are places like community centers, grocery stores dropping off'",
        "'speaker_11': 'these take ones actually going to hospitals, social service agencies, making sure that people that don't necessarily pay attention to the media may not even pay attention to what they get in their mail. But are potential writers or actual writers that will have the opportunity to hear about the closure itself?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Back in July, we actually launched the new Blue Project web page would actually included information about the service interruption as well as the the replacement bus service that was in the works. We actually still have a number of town halls and community meetings that are still scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In fact, tomorrow night we will be here in council chambers in conjunction with Council Councilmember Pierson. Gonzalez holding another community meeting just to make sure that people have the opportunity to ask us questions and to find out more details about what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This morning, we actually had a press conference with Mayor Garcia where we are and Supervisor Janice Hahn and some other members of the Metro. Announced the closure itself more of a reminder as opposed to a general announcement. But we're hoping that through all of these different means and mechanisms, we're able to to reach both our customers and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'our potential customers to let them know not only about the service interruption, but to know about the replacement bus service that we're offering. One of the replacement bus services, the express service, is something that's completely new. Metros never offered that to residents of Long Beach or Los Angeles, and that's a service that goes from Long Beach to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'downtown Los Angeles directly. Hopefully that is something that will be popular. We're anticipating that it will be highly used and maybe, maybe extend it even beyond the service itself. I think with that, that concludes most of our presentation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We do want to make sure that actually one more part. Construction relations. So there's actually twofold. Two parts to our outreach program. The first part is letting people know about the service reps, the second part of the actual construction relations program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And those are the construction impacts that are related to the work that James talked about specifically. So we talk about pulling up all the rail in the city of Long Beach Resort. Talk about replacing those overhead wires. Obviously, those don't come without a little bit of pain.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In some cases, it means that parking is going to be removed. In some cases means that we'll be doing lane closures and things along those lines in order to support the outreach associated with that, we have a construction relations program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That program provides noticing to impacted residents, to stakeholders, whether it be residents or businesses. We actually go out there, we meet with them face to face, one on one with them, and hopefully address many of their concerns. Our team also works directly with our contractors, the multiple contractors that we have on this project to mitigate any potential'",
        "'speaker_11': 'issues. That can be something as simple as, you know, figuring out what the best time is to block a drive, where the best time is to open a driveway, figuring out what's the best time to do some of the noisy work as opposed to the the quiet work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It also means coordinating with local schools to make sure that we ensure access if there's going to be a blocked sidewalk or a drop off area. All of those things are done by our construction relations team and we're actually up and running with that team right now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In fact, I think I have Brett Roberts, who's our senior construction relations officer for the city of Long Beach here, who's been out in the field for the last two months or so, talking to stakeholders directly and working with local organizations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One of the most important parts of this is our construction hotline. It's up there on the screen. 2134183039. That is designed to be answered by a live person. That is for construction related issues, not necessarily service related issues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we provide that to businesses and residents that are impacted by construction so that if there's something that needs immediate attention, they can call that number or get somebody on the phone and we can have somebody out there to address the issue immediately.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We want to be accessible. We want to be communicative. We want to make sure that this is as painless as possible. However, we do recognize that there will be some pain involved, but we do want to make it as painless as possible.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And with that, that concludes our presentation. If you have any questions, we can take those in and filter this the appropriate staffers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And first, I'm going to go with a public comment and then we'll go by the diocese. So anybody from the public and have a comment on these. And.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Name's Larry Goodhue. I doubt that there's any person in this city. That knows more about the MTA offerings, not just the blue line that throughout the system than does this individual who opened the blue line and almost every other line, with the exception of about five or six others.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's no question it needs to be upgraded. It's the methodology they're using. With intelligent planning. There is absolutely no need to shut it down. Any rail system except an extreme emergency. All the work that needs to be done and the improvement than there has to be, there will be decades of improvements, not just here, but across the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You do it at night.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Period. And if you don't have the intelligence within the MTA, you go out and find it. Do it. Now unfortunately, this will cost. And I think I'm thinking beyond the the the blue line. This will cost Mayor Garcetti the his chance to be in the Oval Office.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm an arch Republican, but I think he'd be an absolute asset to this city, to this region, period. But he will not given the tackle here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Approaching and neither the employers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or the employees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of all the industries that are in fact that have to come to work are going to put up with this nonsense period. It doesn't need to be shut down. No ifs. No and no buts. And the biggest disaster, if you're here on the board and you understand this and this doesn't translate it tangibly invents us is the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'disaster.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That you're bringing to the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The incineration of the high school children in Beverly Hills High School, where they're building the rail lines underneath a cavern that is loaded with gas. Period. And if you look at the five different explosions we've had in just in similar incidences, not involving rail.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Over the last three months. Over the last three weeks, you should, because this is an absolute disaster, as I say. It'll cost us the 2028 Olympics. The only way we'll get the 3032 Olympics is 2032 is if we demonstrate that we know how to operate a transit system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next week, a police.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good afternoon. My name is and I can say resident sixth district. A broken clock is right twice. Is it twice in a day? You know, we rarely see eye to eye, but I agree with this man. I think that you know how this has been handled.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. The red line is the busiest. Line four in terms of daily ridership, but that's internal. Most external workers coming in. Mainly service industry workers like myself coming into the city do so on the blue line. You know, according to the study you guys put out, I believe was on the 28th December, you average it about 63,000'",
        "'speaker_8': 'riders daily. So it would be interesting to see the financial impact of this, you know, 30 year debacle. I've been writing this train since there's needed turtles, you know, being used to sell the idea of it. And now, you know, this is something that goes through not just through the inner city, but also through the central heartland'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of this of this region. And, you know, most workers go through it. I also I appreciate you guys taking the concern of the public in regards to the express bus line. I think that's a welcomed response. But I'm curious, I saw on one a year you're doing your presentation there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You said that you had a community meetings on the 23rd in District one into that, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I saw that on your presentation. It would be interesting if maybe you can reach out to my councilman, Mr. Andrews, here. His district services. Willow PCH, as well as Anaheim. And correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Durango, I think Waldo is at the cut off line between the six.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are the hubs that are have the most riders in this a concern. And most people in this area, in my neighborhood at least, don't know about this eight month shutdown. So if you're going to do some community outreach, it would be probably best to do it in the districts that actually have the most riders.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, no disrespect to Mr. Gonzales. I know you have about three or four, and you're between the two of you, Mr. Pierce, as well. But most riders in the city of Long Beach are on the sixth. So if you want to help the city, you know, get it out outreach wise, it would be best to reach out'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to Mr. Andrews, you know, possibly about let the people in the community know about it. Outside of.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That, let's see how it works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Fernando Guerrero, District one. Listen, I am a writer for The Blue Line, and I feel really unsafe there. And I speak for the people that ride the train on a daily basis. Look, we only have to write it now every day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But, you know, on occasions I do. And when I do, I see people being harassed. They're from the LGBT community. I see women being harassed, calling the B-word, the F-word. Oh, no one should be getting harassed. And the train I had to carry a weapon, not just one weapon, but two weapons on me to write that blue'",
        "'speaker_10': 'line. It is awful. It's really awful. I know people are to get drunk, smoked pot, to hop on that train, to sedate themselves. It is horrible. There's no safety there. There's cameras there. What for? There's a guy I just watched the train the other day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A guy went in there. He was already in there. I don't know if he was homeless, but whatever. But he. He started smoking a cigar. A cigar? Really? I had to be I had to go to work. I'm going to smell like cigar.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the guy one time was smoking pot on the train. I had to smoke pot showing up at 9:00 at work. Well, there's no security. I think we need more police officers on the train and on the shuttles.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not safer. It's not safe for people. And I don't care. That person has a mental problem. There's no excuse to be rude or to harass somebody because they want to harass and be bullied. And people do that day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We need security in the trains on blue line desperately before someone gets hurt. Because I'm not going to be bullied on the train. I'm not. I'm doing the right thing. I don't drink. I don't do drugs. We need safety for the blue line, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Will the security officers on the train and shuttles. It's not safe. I to somebody else pulls out a gun. I don't. It's just. I'm getting. I'm just getting. I'm upset. I suddenly had to fear and carry two weapons on me because someone's going to try it at me.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't want to explode on the blue line. We need safety. Safety for the public. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. The general public comment on the statement. Now we'll take it by the diocese. Mr. Spears.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I want to thank Metro for your efforts for coming out. I know that you met with my office, and it was one of the ideas that we had in that meeting to host something in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I appreciate you guys making yourself available tomorrow, and I appreciate Councilwoman Gonzalez sponsoring that event with us. I'm going to ask just a couple of quick questions on the Metro piece, because we do have our community meeting tomorrow night.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I am going to ask a couple of questions of our PD just to make sure we address the safety issues. And I preface this with I for three years rode the blue line from Long Beach to downtown L.A. three times a week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I, I know how uncomfortable sometimes it can be on the blue line. I also know that we've made a lot of security changes. I don't believe you guys did go over, you know, the main changes. And I think there's no worse feeling than the blue line being down at 9:00 at night and you waiting for a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'bus in the middle of somewhere where you've never been. So I appreciate having the busses and I don't know what to say. I hope that the use of them is appreciated and that we can continue them after the blue line has opened back up so that it's not a a waiting, even though we will have the bypass'",
        "'speaker_4': 'lane, which I'm very, very thankful for, I know that adding those bypass lanes is going to be great and I understand that we have to close down the entire process to make sure that it can get done. Are you guys making any improvements on security that you can elaborate on that you did not elaborate on in your'",
        "'speaker_4': 'presentation? I remember that this was mainly about the rail, but I wanted an addition just to make sure we ask and see what the plan is of. It's phase two of this process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would start by saying I'm not necessarily the best guy to talk to about the security piece. I'm the construction guy. But I will say this, you know, we do have a new law enforcement contract.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And we're very excited.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we're the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For all patrols in Long Beach. We have the sheriffs and we have the city of L.A. So during the closure, all those patrols will still be there and they will be patrolling the bus stops. So so in terms of the actual work we're doing, the construction work, there's not so much that directly relates to security.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have a lot of cameras. The lighting has been recently redone. So so for the most part, it's operational improvements on the on the train line. But but the same policing that's currently out there will be out there during the closures.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for that. And I'll ask PD about a process in a minute as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think the other thing that I would add is that at the Willowbrook, Rosa Parks station, which is being completely, completely redone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, very exciting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We actually do have a transit security center that we're putting in there. It's a new one that's adjacent to the public areas and the public plaza. So that will increase the coverage and the visibility of security. And that's actually one of our highest transfer stations, people going from the green line to the blue line.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's one physical improvement that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you for that. I know I was going to ask PD and I know this is not necessarily about safety, but it was brought up. So I want to make sure we address it. I know that there is now an anonymous way we can go online and make a file.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A police report is there because it's very awkward to be on the blue line and calling PD. I don't want to be that person that's sitting there calling PD. Is there a process that we recommend people, whenever they don't feel safe on the blue line to reach out to our officers?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're going to turn this over to Commander Rico Misa. Yeah, I'm not sure the commander is. Part of the team that assigns the blue line officers. But we'll turn over to commander.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Vice mayor of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Microphone.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. Vice Mayor. Respective Council Members. Council Member. In response to your inquiry. Any issues of concern from local community members can be directed to the police department. They can be directed to the police department. But following a police report, they could contact 911.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They could contact our general dispatch number. So there's all sorts of methods in place to identify any issues and concerns, relay them to the police department, whether it's an emergency or a non-emergency matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I really thought that last year we had a new online way and a text way that we could communicate. So maybe that's something we can get a report back on at a later date. But I felt like I was very excited that there was a new way that didn't require me calling 911.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, there are systems in place whereby that information can be communicated to the police department.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Perhaps as we go through this process of Metro and PD can work together, at least on areas of the blue line to communicate that. I know that there's ways, you know, billboards on there that we can make sure that people know there's a way that they can feel a little bit safer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I appreciate everybody's presentation and I appreciate your community outreach. I look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow, district two. Tomorrow night, we will announce it at the end of the meeting as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. I am in no position to comment on this. I'm sorry. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Please go ahead. My name is Santiago. I live in the second district. I'm a retired nurse. I've lived in Long Beach for eight months now. Speaking to the topic. I ride a bicycle and on the regular busses there's only two.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I believe it's two spaces. And when you close down the blue line, there's usually two or three or four bikes on every single car that I've gone onto. So could you please be cognizant of the cyclists? Because I'm an old guy, and it takes me a little extra time to put that bike up there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we might need some help also. Oh, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Now we go back behind the guises, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I second most.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Baby.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, Mrs. Gonzalez, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you again for the report. We look forward to tomorrow's meeting. And I agree as well. I think we'd as much outreach as we can do above and beyond tomorrow's events. We'd be happy to to help with that as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a question. I know we had talked about I mean, the two things that I hear often in downtown are number one. Absolutely. Security. I think I absolutely agree with you. I've taken the blue line from my house off Pacific, you know, to downtown L.A. and it's can be a really awful experience sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's someone who gets it being in the city for ten years. But a lot of residents who visit our city, I don't want them to have that same experience. So the you know, we'd like to just have more information on what I think in addition to the ways that we can reach out to and this is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe more geared towards PD, who we can really reach out to when incidents occur. I would also like to know how we're phasing in police officers on the the blue line, because I know that I've been hearing of a certain amount allotted over a certain period of time, and I would just like more clarification on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whether you have that now, city manager or we can get that in a two from four. That would be great. Okay. And then secondly, are your cameras tied into a specific like. You know, we have a city program here called Cops that it's tied into the city department, the police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do you have that on the on the county side?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, we do. All of our cameras can be viewed at our rail operations control center, which is near Willowbrook, Rosa Parks, and also at a at a security center that we're building at Willowbrook, Rosa Parks, they can view the camera feeds of the blue line from there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I assume so. Just wanted to ask. And then lastly, turnstiles. I know that was another discussion. I know I'm getting a few smirks about that because it's a big one that we've talked about here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's I think a lot of, you know, what some people have discussed me attribute to some of the issues, but are we are adding additional turnstiles or what is the process?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, there's no there's no fair gating plans as part of the new blue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much for the report. And we look forward to additional feedback as we move along. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman. Interesting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Just a couple of things. First of all, thanks for the presentation. I know that there's been outreach through your traditional channels, your ridership. I heard about the outreach within a half mile of a line of the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I represent north long beaches outside of that border. It sort of. WARDLOW It cuts on Long Beach, picks up like Rancho Dominguez, Compton. So a lot of times we head south or we head west, the Compton station. And so any outreach within a half mile misses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I would I would ask a couple of things. So, Mr. West, is it possible before this goes live to tell you some other channels, just the broadly, you know, whatever our channels are, the link will be the city website, maybe even.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we have relationships and billboards and just direct people to where they can get the information. Certainly. Okay, great. And then and then I would think I would ask Metro if there's maybe some you know, we can talk with you about some hotspots, the libraries, you know, maybe some places that people go in North Long Beach to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'make sure that they get the information and something we can work together on. Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. You know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. One of the topics that stood out to me in terms of what the Metro Blue Line is going to be doing during this interim construction is the establishment of an express line from downtown Long Beach to seventh and Metro, which I think will require the express taking, what, seven, ten to the four'",
        "'speaker_8': 'or five to the Harbor Freeway and then down. I drive that and it takes it all day. So just to get a general idea, what is the the current time that it takes from downtown Long Beach along the blue line with all its current reconstruction to seventh in metro.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Just for clarification, we're talking about the rail service, correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're talking about the Express here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We talk about the bus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Is that what the Express is about?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, it's the bus. Right. So the bus service takes approximately about 60 minutes on average during the peak periods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But my question was right now, if I get a blue line without the construction, correct, how long does it take? 59 minutes. 59 minutes. So it's not every that much different. Your estimation is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The estimation is that that would provide comparable service. So we'd be within five and 10 minutes of you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's true. That's incredible. From what I could tell, it's going to be more in an hour with with the traffic, especially on the 405 and the 110. Even if you take the express lanes, it's a long it's a long trip.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just mentioned it out there because I think that given the additional time that it's going to take people to go from downtown Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles, I think there might be a loss of ridership there because of the length of time people are going have to get there earlier.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're going to have to make accommodations for the time difference. And so how many how many of these express busses are you going to be having that are going to be going from downtown Long Beach, downtown L.A., 1 to 1, every hour and every 2 hours?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What what what's the what's the the amount of express busses? You're going to have to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At least ten busses an.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hour. Ten. About ten bucks an hour. Mm hmm. Okay. Well, that sounds good to me, but so you might want to consider that the time factor in there in terms of how long it's going to take from downtown Los Angeles to downtown Long Beach, or vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that you might want to look at some alternative routes or alternative ways of getting people from point A to point B, because I think that we're going to be losing some ridership in that. And there's going to be a lot of frustration and and some people who are going to be very disappointed with the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'plan. So is pointing that out to you. So be aware of it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, we've done our best to to guess what our riders are actually going to do when we close the line. But we don't know actually what they're going to do. And so we're going to remain flexible with the service out there is that we're going to watch it every day and we're going to see how it's'",
        "'speaker_7': 'working and we're going to make adjustments on the fly to make sure that we're we're providing the right level of service. So we're right there with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Councilman. Congressman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. And I want to thank Metro for coming in and giving us a very detailed explanation. This is obviously going to require some some some adjustments from from riders, and it's going to be some growing pains to get here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But understanding that the the Metro Blue Line was the very first light rail system in the metro light rail system. Right. This was the very first two tickets. I went to a 25 year celebration that a couple of years ago.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So understanding where that is, that technology and best practices have actually been been employed in some of the newer lines. I think it's important that that this the blue line be be equipped with the best as well. I'd like to just just kind of focus a little bit and we understand is going to be a lot of'",
        "'speaker_12': 'inconvenience. It's going to be some some some inconvenience, particularly on the riders. It's going to be inconvenience on those like myself who are trying to commute on the freeway and, you know, seeing more busses on. There is not something that I'm looking forward to either, particularly in that fast track lane.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I'd like to focus a little bit on what the outcomes will be. I was watching I was sitting next to on the blue line just just just yesterday and was I noticed how noisy it was with the repairs and upgrades and reduce the audibility for a lot along the line.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'How will the the line be more efficient to riders and how much safer will the line be once this project is done? Can somebody answer the question?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think the main words we've been using have been reliability and resiliency. Reliability and resiliency. Those are those are really what we're looking at on the reliability front. And James talked a little bit about this. The overhead wire has been up there for 29 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It needs to be replaced. So the blue line is prone, can be prone to breaking down and we don't want that to happen. So we want it to be reliable that the when it's supposed to be at a station, it's going to be at the station.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On the resiliency side, one of the things that has plagued us is that we don't have enough crossover tracks to move from one track to another and that, you know, if there's a track incursion, let's say an automobile, get stuck on the track or a train is down, then sometimes it could take us 20 minutes to single'",
        "'speaker_7': 'track around it and then the schedule is blown for the day. So with these new crossover tracks, we can be resilient and we can get around something as if it's a normal schedule. It's very important to us that's also going to help us with maintenance in the future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because of this lack of crossover tracks, we weren't able to get very much time at night to maintain the system. This gives us an opportunity to maintain the system in a state of good repair while while maintaining a regular schedule.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So those are the two very important pieces.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then finally, thank you for for want to stay up there, if you will. I know that there was some, some discussion, particularly when we were looking at the measure m expenditures and looking at opportunities to improve the blue line efficiency and just the flow of traffic in and Long Beach period.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The Wardlow station was one that that stood out as a as a as an opportunity, opportunities to improve safety, opportunities to improve the flow of traffic with but also connecting our active transportation bike boulevard as well as pedestrian safety.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And part of what was discussed and I know I had an opportunity to look at some some sketches of some possibilities was to look at taking that from an ad grade model to above grade or below grade. Where is that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And are we continuing to look at that possibility for the Wardlow station?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are system wide. So so we have been busy over the last six or eight months working on reporting back to our board on what the feasibility is, because they've asked us the same thing. They've asked us to look at, you know, undergrounding the Washington Junction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They've asked us to look at grades separating the entire blue line. And we're going to be reporting back to them soon in the next couple of months. On what the results of those efforts are. I will say this I don't want to prejudge what they might tell us, but it's very expensive, you know, billions and billions of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'dollars, expensive to to to grade separate the blue line. So I wouldn't hazard a guess on whether that may or may not be in the cards, but we need to have a discussion with our board about that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, I think it it's a worthy discussion. And we need to look at greater separation as strategic junctures. And I think the Wardlow in Pacific area is one of those those areas where we've I mean, it's actually been identified in the L.A. Times as one or the worst station in the in the system.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so, again, I'll continue to look forward to continuing that conversation in the future.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. You know, I just want to thank the individual coming down, because when I heard the words, I mean, look, you know, you're going to be flexible. That means you listen and I know what you're going to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's going to be a good job, because when you talk about progress, you're going to have a lot of, you know, complaints and things of this type. But we need it. And I know you're going to get it done because you have some of the most professional people, you know, in doing this.'",

And if you need any more information, you know, just call out to these individuals because you're here.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening again. Tonight you have before you an application for entertainment without dancing for Black Albee L.P. Doing Business as Black. Located at 1800 East Broadway. Operating as a restaurant with alcohol in Council District two, all of the necessary departments have reviewed the application and have provided their recommended conditions as contained in the hearing packet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I, as well as the police department, stand ready to answer any questions that counsel may have. And that concludes staff's report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why would you like to go public comment, please. Any public comment on this? And please come forward. Come forward, please. State your name. You have 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name is Maria Severance. I. My family has been related to Long Beach life for 50 years. We always have to want to improve their neighborhoods and we have done very good things about the properties. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You said that these black bees with they don't they don't have license for drinking. That's because what happened is that. They are locating in a neighborhood that is very residential. There's in the corner of Broadway and Sitka. There's only residential no parking at old zero.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not even the residents in the area have parking. So we have a very complicated situation there. We have before paradise was a bar and these people were mature and they behaved really good. But since these black these that year ago, they moved there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For us, the peace and quiet have ended. This this crowd is very loud crowd. And they come and they impact all the neighborhood. Everything that is here, most are down to second is fact it they the customers, they come drunk.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They sit in your in the stairs of your of your house. They drink, they throw a lot of trash. They sometimes vomit in around your house and they wait for their over. They leave or whatever. And they are loud, they are fights, they are really loud.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At 2:00 in the morning, maybe you have hear more complaints because most of these people that live there are tenants. But like I, we are the owner of one of the buildings that is located in Section A and I already have complained about this before and it didn't change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I thought it was the work of Broadway, but not this early commotion is there in second, second and Hermosa those are one one lane and and they are they are traffic loud and we have to live with this so we don't have any peace and quiet of our neighborhood that supposed to be residential I can believe they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have a license to these kind of is for skateboarders young people they are loud they make a lot of noise and we are suffering the consequences since that is helping. So I don't agree that they're going to get another license to make more noise that don't impact our lives more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The owners of the properties are the the tenants. They go they have their they can move. But we have to deal every year to have another tenant that doesn't like the noise that is happening there, especially in the corner of Hermosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And second day life is impossible. I hope that you don't agree with their license.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lois Leger, 1739 Appleton Street. I'm a block away, and I'm also a past president of Alameda Speech Neighborhood Association. When I was president, we cleaned up the neighborhood around the park, especially in the sandboxes where there were drugs and paraphernalia left.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now it's moved up two blocks. So in the morning you can find blood on the sidewalk, you can find paraphernalia. And she's right. It's loud. And they congregate on the outside. And I'm guilty because I haven't called the cops.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've talked to the police at the neighborhood association. But I'm going we're going to be in very close contact as well as with the city councilwoman, even though we've told our staff. So it is a problem. I don't like it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't walk there at night, but it's just nasty. And if you can help us, I'd appreciate it. If not, don't worry. We'll be on it.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I've been in the industry for a long time. Um. There is a problem with.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The riffraff that has caused. From the opening of this place.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hi there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Jennifer Peterson. I am a producer, director and a local podcast host. And I live on Hermosa Avenue, which is directly across from Black Bar, and I am very much against this entertainment permit. I love my neighborhood, but since Black Bar took over the Paradise Bar, things have gone downhill fast in the months they have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'been open. My life and lifestyle has changed drastically. Now we have a very dangerous energy to our street, especially on the weekends. I've had to call the police numerous times a week on noise, trespassing, street blockage, driveway blockage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when I reported to Black's management months ago that there were some guys doing of some drugs which I witnessed in their back area. I and I pointed out that zero security. They added security for a while, but now I've noticed it's infrequent at best.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I never called the police once when Paradise Park was there. I want that to be very clear. I'm not someone who calls the police all the time. Until recently, we now have what looks like gang graffiti on lampposts and on the corner liquor store that we can that I know the owner can't get off.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was not there before. My neighbor had to leave. She was here and she wanted to speak, but she had to leave cash there, meaning she witnessed a fight that escalated into a bloody mess. The cops were called for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is a residential neighborhood that has completely shifted its vibe since they have moved and especially the past couple of months. I can't even watch a movie in my living room because of noise mixed with this dread of a bullet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not being dramatic here, a bullet coming through my window. I personally think that's where we are heading and why I am here today. I want there to be a record that someone spoke out about the escalation of crime in a very lovely neighborhood that I was excited to live in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My car has been broken into. My neighbor had her place broken into all since the bar moved there. I know you can't prove that, but I mean that there's a link there. But I don't think it's a coincidence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm just afraid that someone's going to get hurt, a gun will be pulled out. And I hope it's not me or one of my neighbors or my dogs. But seeing the kind of people this bar is now attracting, I believe it's really, truly inevitable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The weekend nights are loud enough beyond loud. Most of us who live near the bar can't get to sleep, fall asleep until two or 3 p.m.. And this was never an issue at the Paradise Bar, so I have no idea why they need a new license or an extended license.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I hope they don't get it. And a quick note from my landlord, Anita. She is and also an art teacher, Anita Sinclair. She's she says Black Bar has already started to destabilize our neighborhood since they took over the Paradise location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we have had their clients parking in or blocking our driveway, bloody fights in the street. Uber, Lyft, taxis and personal vehicles. Thank you. In front and Maidan. Okay. Thank you for allowing me to speak. And I hope they don't get, you know, this license.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How are you doing? Jonathan Robin Soil I live in. I've been a resident for 28 years here. Born and raised. I am the lead bartender at Black. I'm there all the time. Yes, we do have our problems, but it's nothing a new bar hasn't had before with change in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are going through a lot of businesses coming in and long, which is changing day by day. That goes with buildings, that goes to just infrastructure in general. They came from Hollywood and they landed on Hermosa and Broadway.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I happily work there. We do everything in our like in our we do everything in our power to keep it safe on that block, including myself. We have security every day. They're outside and they're hired. And we have three security guards on on weekends at all times.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wish no harm on anybody. We do hire everybody, especially people like an iconic cafe which are going to be affected by this. He is a DJ and. It's nothing that paradise didn't have before. Paradise had a license to carry out, you know, entertainment so as not having this license.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would just affect people in the community. You know, I don't. I don't think that's necessary for us not to have it. You know, we hire people in Long Beach from Long Beach and put money back into Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think it'd be wrong to brand to just brand us with such a black guy. No pun intended.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So. Yeah. Yeah. Good night. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How's it going? My name is. And I can say I was, you know, on the way here, I was just looking at press telegram, archives of Alamitos Beach in the Broadway corridor just to give a an idea of things in the past and in the present.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I welcome anyone to just do an easy Google search. And you'll see this conversation we're having now, the same kind of conversation people were having in the eighties. You know, my father lives on 31 and Pedro in 1984.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, people were saying the same thing about older residents in Alamitos Beach, were saying the same thing about the proliferation of the bars. Then that they're saying now, you know, there's three bars up the street that, yes, maybe the clientele is different.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the reality of the situation is, is that there's a reason why the Paradise Bar is not there anymore. It's because they couldn't maintain the business. Now you hear here you have a new business coming in. This is a small business.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're coming into the community. They're representing a very cohesive members of the community, the skate community. I'm not a skater, but I do recognize that this is a part of the community, especially in this area with with the Bixby Park there that is well represented thanks to places like this bar.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they do have business there. And it has, as the man before me just said, they employ and they they provide opportunities for people who live in the community to live in the city. Yes, it's a young audience.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And yes, they're rambunctious. And obviously with any bar, you know, there comes the unfortunate reality of what people do outside of the bar. But whereas inside of the bar, there is ample security and there's, you know, people who are constantly observant and not even just on the reality of, you know, the people coming in day to day'",
        "'speaker_8': '. You know, there's the food services that they provide, you know, the delicious impossible burger that you can get there. I didn't know about it until I went up in there and, you know, trying to do new things. But, you know, it's it's unfortunate for the neighbors who live in in the in the neighborhood that parking is in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a already overburdened neighborhood is, you know, being impacted by this bar. But that's not the bar's problem. That's more of an issue with city government and the narrow streets that an older part of the town more in is this bar is issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm I personally as a representative of the music community in this city. I'm happy to have this this bar come in and provide opportunities for entertainment. And I would have occasion for, you know, this anytime entertainment permit coming their way so that we don't have, you know, situations like fortunately Vine where, you know, you have a bar'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in a neighborhood area that that can only be open up until 1030 and 11. You know, this is something that can service and bring more live music and live entertainment and to a city that is devoid of those at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, is that the last speaker out there? Because I'm going to close out the speaker like you're a young lady. You'll be the last speaker. Thank you. Go ahead, sir.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. My name is Jeff, Darling, and I own the mineshaft and brick bar in the next block. And the Paradise used to be my uncle's bar for many, many years. And then Michael Barber ended up with that bar, and we had owned the building at the time, and he decided to sell because he couldn't make it a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'viable business. And if you see what Shannon, Bethany Heath and Jessica have done there, they've remodeled the building, put great expense and effort into making it a beautiful, vibrant spot. Our clientele that has been LGBTQ centric for many, many years, we will see our patrons in that bar.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So kind of categorizing it as a skater bar, I think really misrepresents it. And if you go in there, you'll see our clientele there. You'll see somebody in drag. He'll see somebody that might be a you know, a very, very diverse, ever changing Long Beach neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I know from a small business perspective, them not being able to have the ability to have a deejay or some form of entertainment is going to tie the hands of a small business person. I see 24, you know, they have security all the time that they're open there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I know compared to what we do, I'm sure they far exceed what we do in security. And there seem to be very proactive to me in the community and very upstanding, easy to communicate with and have always come to the table when I wanted to have conversations with them about any issues and we're kind of all'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in this together. And so I think they already need to abide by the rules that the ABC license has and complaints of service either get dealt with or don't get dealt with. But I think they the mere factor that they they couldn't have a deejay, you know, a noise ordinance will be effective all the time, whether they'",
        "'speaker_10': 'have the entertainment license or not. The Paradise had the entertainment license in its entire existences. So I don't think just by granting them a license, it would change anything. So I support them getting a license, as, you know, relatively competing business in the same block.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next week.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hello. First, I'd like to thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Honorable, honorable vice mayor and all the council people for everything that you do for us, for the city, and to all the law officers here. Thank you for keeping the city safe. You guys are all doing a great job.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I live within blocks of the new black bar. I walk by there every day. I walk by there every night. I am not a skater. I've enjoyed going into this bar. I've seen all the work that they put into it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think this city is proud of and and has been built on diversity. It took a big risk for them to come into this neighborhood and bring something different. And that's what they did. They brought some diversity. They brought some new life into the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can only speak for myself personally. When I go to the bar, I feel secure. I have never been there when there hasn't been security. I feel safe. I feel like.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a good mix. I don't feel like it's any one group.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm very happy to welcome them to the neighborhood. And it also takes time when a new business opens to find your place and and to wheel in things and and to learn how to control your crowd. I'm for giving them an entertainment permit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I hope that you'll. Think that way. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I saw something that very scary, me and my mom other night. I saw a group, left a bar fight in front of my window. I called the police, but unfortunately they not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Come in time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Welcome any questions or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If anyone has any issues. I think really that we've had as as it happens, a lot of people talking about who the owners are, what they're about. We wanted to show our faces, show that we're. Young looking, middle aged women with children.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this was our dream to create bars and create a neighborhood place for people to come and get to know people that you wouldn't normally rub elbows with. And like Robert said, it is taking a second. There are some things that we've got gone we weren't prepared for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we we understand and we're just asking for people to be patient. I do speak with the police and Jennifer, our soldier, to ask for different ways that could help us. This is a new community for us, but we do have all employees from the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we sit and have employee meetings and ask for any kind of opinions that could make things better. We are also having Sergeant Garcia come from Los Angeles to do a lead program on Tuesday with our bar and several of the bars in the neighborhood, probably a total of 50 to 60 people, including all of our security'",
        "'speaker_3': ', to do a Q&A and to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Over like star training.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lead program. We do that of the bar in Hollywood and it's very helpful. Staff and security. So we just want you guys to know that although we do hear what everybody's saying, we want you to know that we are actively working hard to rectify any anything that could create a problem in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are not partiers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were not there till three in the morning and we're like, it's 138 to get home to my kids, you know? So we wanted to be here and show our faces and to take any questions or. I also wanted to mention real quick that getting the entertainment permit wouldn't change anything because we've had the paradise is carried'",
        "'speaker_3': 'over to us. So it's not anything different. It's not like we're going to get one and all of a sudden it's going to be different. Crazy. We we already have one. Right now we're just asking for a new one and a transfer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So is there any questions or comments?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much for listening. We just wanted to know we're really excited to be a part of the community and we plan on being active and getting to know all of you and attending the meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much, Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. My name is Ron Stiller. I run the wine mess liquor next door to the black bar. I wanted to take him succeed. That's not the point. I know everyone that has taken come down here and spoke. I personally, I have to clean up blood on the side of my my bar, my liquor store.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have to run kids off this smoking dope. I didn't know that you could smoke dope legally out in California. I know it's legal, but you're not supposed to do it outside drinking. They stand on top of my tables.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have people that has to stay later in the night time to keep them run out. My son on the. New Year's Eve. He had to break up three fights. They fight outside. They run in the store. One to fight in the store.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We had to take and close our door. I want him to succeed. I want him to be part of the community. But they have to take and realize the area that we're in is a residential area and the people that's in the area, they don't want to put up with it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want them to take and succeed. I want them to take and do good, but I want to be part of the community and be responsible to be part of the community. All the things that everyone has taken and said, I can testify to every one of them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know the owners. I know, Jeff. I know everyone on the block. We just want them to be responsible community with us, not the idea that we have to take and get used to them. They had to take and get used to community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's all I have to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Spirit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And thank you, everybody, for coming down and speaking today. I want to highlight a couple of things that we've in the last couple of days, try to go out and do some of our research. I do want to say, you know, the history of this location, Paradise, was very near and dear to many of our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hearts. And so the transfer over to a new owner, I think, was very it had a lot of anxiety for a lot of people in the neighborhood because Paradise had been there for so long. The owners reached out to us well before they started doing work on the establishment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think every issue that we've brought up, either ourselves or PD or the community members, they have been really diligent in trying to address those. And so what I want to make sure is that we have an open communication and that we are addressing those quickly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did receive probably from everyone that spoke tonight letters this weekend, and that was the first written kind of concerns that we had. So I made sure to follow up with PD and I'm not sure if PD you guys want to answer these questions, but over the last year, if you could share with us about the letters'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that were sent out to residents and what the response was, and also calls for service for a bar like this. I know it is a big shift. The demographics are younger, but if you could talk to us about the calls for service that we've had and so we can ask some questions about that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure. Commander Rudy Misa representing the police department once again. So in response to your inquiry, the police department conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the location in question during the timeframe of September 20th, 2016, December 20th, 2018 21. Calls for service were identified.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think it should be noted that since Black has taken over ownership, there have been 11 calls for service to incidents and zero arrests. Out of the 11 calls for service, six were actually placed by an employee from the business.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The PD evaluation is is actually very comprehensive in addition to the crime analysis that's done and that is evaluating the calls for service. We also reached out to the South Division commander and their staff, specifically the police resource officer.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They reach out to police officers to get opinions, essentially evaluating the location in question. The commander of the South Division did not see any issues of concern in granting this entertainment permit to the local business. In addition, Council Member, in response to your question as far as how many residents were contacted, 56 residents were contacted, and that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'would be within 100 feet of the establishment. 56 residents were contacted. Of those 56 residents, 46 we were unable to contact. But we did leave mailers and surveys to offer input regarding any issues or concerns that they may have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There were two residents that were not opposed to the entertainment permit and eight were opposed to the entertainment permit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we have. I see that we have one noise calls. Did we do I see we had one noise call where noise measurements were made, but they were under the noise regulations that the information you have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There was one music call that was determined to be unfounded during the timeframe of September 18th, 2018 to January 22nd, 2019. That would have been during the one year short term entertainment permit. As far as evaluating the actual decibels of the noise.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do not believe that would be the case. But the musical was determined to be unfounded through P.D. response.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you for that. I also want to highlight that you guys have voluntarily brought on security guards on the weekend that that's not required. I have a couple of questions for you guys if you want to come back down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to know for the days that you have entertainment, are those the days that you have security or do you just say security on the weekends, but maybe you have entertainment on the weekdays? Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have security.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Seven days a week. There is one guard. Sunday through Wednesday and then two guards on Thursdays. And three guards.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So if so, I want to make sure that whatever you guys that that statement is codified in your conditions, that if you have entertainment, that you have security guards on staff. Yes. So it's something that seems like you're already doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to make sure that we have it codified so that residents can have a process to engage in that conversation, it's not a volunteer thing, but it's part of the condition. So that makes sense. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It won't be a problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because nothing has to change because it's okay. We'll do anyway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And then let me ask for your security cameras. I know that we have a program with PD where it can loop in with PD. Do you guys currently do that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, actually, I wasn't aware of that until today. Okay. So we will get that done within the next week and I'll just need to know who to contact. Great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we'll make sure that you have the right contact, but making sure that your feed is directly tied in. So if there's any issues that we can address those issues to the concerns, I know there were a lot of statements made about fights.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that from speaking to PD that there was one incident that was outside and that your staff was the staff that called. So I just want to make that from our understanding and again, encourage folks to reach out to us if there's any issues that folks might have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The other requests that I would like to make in the conditions is that you guys have a community liaison person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that you guys have offered from before you opened your doors to host community meetings. Yes. And so in the next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Two, we work closely with them at Hollywood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. So in the next 30 days, I would like to host a community meeting with you guys so that we can have our residents there, make sure they have a process of engagement, a point person, and that we're addressing any of these issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I know that you guys have been really good about addressing issues that we bring up. We just need to create that space so that residents, it seems like it's one building across the street that have been the ones that have a challenge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't know if there's a noise tunnel that goes that way to them, but perhaps there's a noise vacuum for them so that we're good with 30 days. Okay. And then the other thing I'd like to add is in this neighborhood, it is a residential area, but it is a business corridor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, Broadway has been envisioned as a business corridor. We're working on creating a business improvement district. I know we've had lots of conversations with Robert and everybody, and so a commitment to make sure that we're doing that and that we have things like power washing that's consistent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm wondering, do you have a power washing plan?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do. That's funny. Donnie, you spoke okay. I brought my power washer. We do a lot of things ourselves. Yeah. So, yeah. So I have actually power washed twice and Johnny did it the other day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's great. So it's great that you do it at your establishment. I think for all of Broadway, I mean, somebody who walks Broadway on occasion, I would like it for the entire block. So I know we're working on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we have yeah, we've implemented other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Things too. I think that can help with that along with the power washing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So on that, if you guys could talk really quickly about LEED because you've talked about it briefly, but just so community members understand, I think that doing a training with your bartenders both on serving and what that looks like would give some security to some of our residents as well to make sure that that training.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So every one from our staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Except for security has they've all completed the lead program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And where they actually went. And Jessica is the general manager of our bar restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Earlier.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, but that that training does what for your staff? I guess my question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is, does star training at LAPD and that's all he does is either give the talks at they have, I think once a month different places around Los Angeles. But he will actually come to your location if you have more than 25.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it's it specifically talks about how to serve and how to notice if somebody is over the limit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Got drunk two drunk people how to handle that, how like what kind of procedure to take implementing procedures and protocols for. I don't I'm like but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That that's very helpful. Yeah. So I think having that in place is yes, power washing but let's get it to where people are not throwing up outside.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I want to say real quick that the great thing is, is that he will go over everything and he does a wonderful Q&A. And when we did it, Hollywood ended up being like almost a three hour meeting because the staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To talk about their own personal experience in working behind the bar or being out the door. And he will give advice like as far as like rancid, the pot smoking, you know, how to deal with that out front.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's been the most the greatest learning experience for our bar in Hollywood. So we asked him if he would be willing to travel down here and he said he would. So we're just kind of opening it up to other bars because we feel like it's so valuable to everyone in this business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And yeah, he'll address issues and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'll have that forum that we can ask him. Stuff. Yeah. Anything as far as fakes, all that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you. I think those are the questions I have for you guys. Appreciate it. Staff, let me ask, is there a timeline on, you know, if we approve today versus approved in 30 days? I know that it's a limited time because it's a transfer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no set timeline. Okay. So I. I would like to make sure that we have the time to meet with the community members. So I'd like to. He's rock and roll. And Linda. I, I don't necessarily want to have to do a whole nother hour of show, but if you guys are committing to doing this community, meeting'",

I'm turn you over to Katie Borders to share our progress to date and then I'll share a little bit more about moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you, Kelly. So the city of Long Beach is home to approximately half a million people and 46.6 of residents over the age of five speak a language other than English at home. Nearly 178,000 residents speak either English, Spanish or I'm sorry, Spanish, Khmer, Tagalog.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Language access services allow these community members to receive essential city services, engage directly in the decision making process, and, most importantly, have their voices heard. The Language Access Policy establishes standards and procedures for providing language access in city services programs and resources in the top three languages spoken in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The policy also provides for over the phone interpretation recorded outgoing messages for city phone lines, interpretation at public meetings and translation of city documents. It also includes coordination of a bilingual staff directory and training for bilingual staff so that they can provide interpretation and translation services as needed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Language Access Coordinator is working to implement the policy consistently across all departments. To do this, she developed a language access policy or lap kit to train staff and promote language services and provides a 30 minute lap training that staff to staff that provides an overview of the policy services and how to use them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fiscal year 2018, the lap coordinator conducted 13 staff trainings, directly reaching 385 employees. We invite any city staff to request lap trainings from us to ensure that all residents who speak a language other than English can easily access city services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She also maintains a bilingual staff directory of 722 city staff who receive bilingual skill pay when they provide translation or interpretation. The city staff who receive bilingual skill pay are required to review two training videos that address appropriate techniques and ethics, ethics for interpretation and translation, as well as the use of children as interpreters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The bilingual staff directory is updated every six months and is available on the city's intranet. In cases where interpretation is needed and a bilingual staff member is not immediately available, we also provide over the phone interpretation. Our vendor, the language line, provides 24/7 access to over 8000 professionally trained interpreters who speak more than 240 languages.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fiscal year 2018, language line provided the city with interpretation for 191 calls in nine different languages. When someone calls the city department, they can access assistance in their preferred language using our translated outgoing phone messages. Currently, there are 74 city phone lines that have menus translated in Spanish and Tagalog.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The lab coordinator coordinates onsite interpretation for public meetings as well. In fiscal year 2018, Language Access provided the service at 98 public meetings for 19 different departments and city council offices. This reflects a 44% increase compared to fiscal year 2017.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In addition to onsite interpretation, we also help ensure that city documents are translated in Spanish common Tagalog in fiscal year 18. The lap coordinator coordinated the translation of 190 documents for 17 city departments and council offices. This number remained consistent compared to last year.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'During the FOIA 19 budget process, we were directed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Language Access Program. The evaluation has been completed and the report is being drafted. It will be available in the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The evaluation included a review of the implementation of the language access policies in other jurisdictions around the country, a project in partnership, which was a partner and project with the California State University Long Beach Linguistics Department, looked at 11 different city facilities.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We held resident focus groups in Spanish in May, held key informant interviews with interpreters who frequently provide services and interpretation services for our program, and a satisfaction survey of city staff who have used the Language Access Program in the last year.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The preliminary findings include that there's just an overall lack of awareness still or utilization of our services in the community. There's a lack of awareness and utilization of the language line. We did learn that 87% of those that have used the document translation are satisfied and 78% are satisfied with the turnaround time for those documents.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is closely related to communication regarding expected turnaround times with regard to interpretation. 100% of respondents were satisfied with the services are provided and 92% were satisfied with the interpreters, punctuality and professionalism. Because we often work with the same interpreters at the many community meetings where interpretation is provided.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We conducted key informative interviews with them to better understand their observations and experiences in the community. We learned more about the importance of community interpreting as a specific skill that requires knowledge of context, background and community dynamics. One interpreter we spoke with spent time before every meeting, reviewing documents and key terms so that she prepared for the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'event. Often, the interpreters are asked to assist residents in understanding forms or navigating a challenge which they take away, which can take away from their ability to be interpreting for the broader context. Yet overall, the interpreters received positive feedback from the residents who are very grateful that they're there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The results of the comprehensive evaluation showed us that despite the work that we've invested and the great progress we've made so far, we know we can do better. We've already begun a plan for developing the following working with the Council District and the Budget Office to provide interpretation at the community budget meetings.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Translating the Community Budget Book and partnering with the Budget Office to provide a multilingual community budget meeting. Partnering with the Department of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Communications as part of their efforts to develop a disaster response plan for individual disabilities and functional needs.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Offering quarterly trainings as well as flexible formats to help departments identify strategies to overcome specific language access challenges. Working more closely with community partners to increase awareness of our language access program among our residents. Increase in the pool of vendors to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of document, translation and interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Currently we have the Language Access Program, has a coordinator who operates 28, who works for 27 hours a week, full time, that is structurally funded in $160,000 and one time funding, which is an increase from $80,000 last year.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so those services, many of these services are able to be provided through that increase. However, with the increase in the focus on training, access, outreach, and those will be coming to you in the future to increase the the position from part time to full time to be able to continue this move.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig Beck to talk about signage and facilities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. Good evening, counsel. You may recall in back in November of 2018, there was information provided this council regarding the new Civic Center project. And the project includes three primary buildings, the Port Administration Building, our new City Hall, and also the downtown library.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We are employing new language access policies in all these buildings, including the translation of signage in the common areas. So in the lobby of the new City Hall and Port Building and library, as someone comes in, there is going to be a reception area that will be translated into four languages and also opportunity for translation services at'",
        "'speaker_9': 'all of the public counters. Lap cards will be available along with access to translation. I think what one of the things that we're really looking forward to is investment in new technology. So in the new council chambers, we will have a new translation services device that will allow us to have multiple channels on one set of headphones'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So depending on what language you're seeking or if maybe you're hearing impaired, you'll have you'll be able to use the same device. And those translation services can happen in a different room. So they don't have to necessarily be in the auditorium themselves.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We find that that that will help with the translation services. And we also looked into utilizing hearing induction loops. So we know a lot of people that are hearing impaired will wear hearing aids. And the induction loops that we're putting into our large assembly rooms, including the new chambers, will allow people to tune in and hear what's'",
        "'speaker_9': 'being either translated or just the presentation itself through these induction loops. So the new technology is a step forward. We believe that that the the flow and and access in the new city hall is going to be very intuitive and help people achieve services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that concludes my report. I'm available to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Continuing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I wanted to also thank my colleagues and results for the First District, Ginny Pearson second and Dallas, who not the fourth. And joining me in this discussion and in this overview, what's taking place with the language arts program at this point?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it would be appropriate if my colleagues did not defer that. We go to the public comment and I will take it back here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Hi. So okay with you? Good. Okay. Please. If anyone like to speak honestly, won't you please come forward?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I was actually surprised to not see lack of translated signs for directory to location within the building, little to no translated documents to which language other than English speakers can access and most important, LPC resources. Not many citizens were aware of the sleep resources, which is very concerning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I know there isn't. Like there isn't much and not a lot of funds to expand on these services remedies. But that is why I'm here before you. So I am, as I am a student who grew up in the immigrant community, and I'm here to urge the city to invest more in the space, mainly immigrant communities'",

        "'speaker_10': 'The ways how the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'City can help is by increasing the distribution of vital documents, as this will make services and information much more easier to navigate. And access, in addition, needs to be implemented consistently across all city departments so our communities won't be discouraged with about accessing certain departments due to language barriers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And lastly, there needs to be more active outreach to residents who may not know about yep. Through there, through collaborations with community based organizations. With these recommendations, our communities would be would be able to navigate our city and.'",

I'm also the program manager for the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition, and we're a member of the Language Access Coalition. And I think all of you should have the fact that the coalition put together and I'm here to tell you a little bit about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what we heard from community members in collaboration with the Office of Equity. We hosted a focus group with Spanish speaking community members where they share with us their experiences when accessing city services. Due to my limited time here, I will only share the highlights of this focus group.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But to start with, on November 14, 2017, the City Council passed the motion asking for multilingual signage at the New City Civic Center and other new city buildings. Markups of the new Civic Center have incorrect translations, and there has been no report back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About the multilingual signage at other city buildings. Second, the quality of interpretation in translation by the city vendor is poor. Community members who have who we've spoken to have told us that translation is not properly done. They have had a hard time understanding the translated documents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In particular, one community member told us that the translation appears to be very direct. Literally like a literal translation of the English signs that don't make any sense in Spanish. Thirdly, and one of the most critical things that we heard in the focus group is that most community members were not even aware of this policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is. It wasn't until we told them about whether they knew that it existed. Many of them shared with us that they had no idea that there's a provided translation, a city council meetings, and they had no idea that you had to request it within 24 hours in advance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lastly, lack of consistent implementation of the language access policy throughout the city departments is a huge problem for those community members who were aware of this policy and have tried to access city services in different city departments. They were shocked because some of the city staff were not even aware of the policy themselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additionally, language the language line has never been offered to them. So because of the stories, we're here to ask you to correct this problems in the following four ways. One, correct the Civic Center signage, translations and include multilingual signage at other city buildings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Higher higher. A competent vendor for interpretation and translation services. Third Award Stipends to community based organizations to conduct resident outreach. And lastly, direct each department to designated language liaison to work with the Office of Equity to implement this policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We hope that you consider this recommendations and thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Cyndi Dela Cruz Brown. I am a resident of the seventh District, a community organizer with Long Beach Forward and a member of the Long Beach Language Access Coalition. I want to review the last few recommendations that our Coalition has for you on how we can improve the language access policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A policy that we deeply value and know our multilingual members value to. As someone who works with Long Beach residents, particularly parents who speak a language other than English. I hear about their struggles to understand their bills and housing notices.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hear their stories about giving up on navigating our city phone lines after being ping pong from person to person. I hear their frustration and discouragement. Like Gaby mentioned previously, the focus group showed us that even active members in our community who are engaged and trusted leaders have a difficult time navigating city services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One mom.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Told us she has to wait for her children, her husband, to get home, to get every to get anything done at city hall due to the language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Barrier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's just something about the voices that are being left out of the decision making process with city happenings. And we are missing an opportunity to address issues that most affect each family, neighborhood and district. In our hand out, you will see that our fifth recommendation is the complete translation of phone lines and voicemails.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since this is not complete across city departments. We also want to make sure that the city's single phone line is implemented appropriately. So we do not run into the same errors that recently occurred with the inaccurate translation of the New City Civic Center Science.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our sixth recommendation is to complete translation of vital documents such as city notices.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Services, bills and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our seventh recommendation is to require staff training to be ongoing recommendations four and seven on the sheet you were handed. Both highlight the need for regular staff trainings to meaningfully implement the language access policy and to invest now in this infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we give language access and language equity a fair chance. This means staff would receive training on the requirements of policy and of the policy, like how to work with residents with limited English proficiency and so on. And lastly, structurally funding the language access policy, which means having a line item per department for translation and interpretation services'",
        "'speaker_4': ', hiring bilingual front desk staff, moving the current part time coordinator to full time to implement the policy. It makes it it makes it difficult for staff to implement the very various components of this policy if they're only part time employees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Implementation does take a long time. We are wasting time, resources and money by not implementing this policy. Well, we would like to continue our dialog and collaborative approach to support to supporting language access for a city that provides prides itself on its diversity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also want to thank the Office of Equity Staff for their great work. Katie, Francesca, everyone in.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'Was a student project examining the implementation of language access across 11 unique city sites. So I was.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Responsible for synthesizing those reports.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And summarizing some of those patterns. And to put it frankly, what the students saw was disheartening. This included inconsistent knowledge of language access policy within the staff at a single site which often led to contradictory information and advice, you know, from members of the same staff.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That lack of knowledge also led to.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'In addition, conducting outreach to community members who have a limited English proficiency is vital because most residents don't know about the city's language access policy. Both my parents have limited English proficiency, and they are unaware of this policy, which is why there should be stipends to community based organizations to conduct resident outreach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also need to complete vital document documentation translation for all departments and train staff on a regular basis because minors should not be interpreters. Growing up, I often found myself having to translate for my parents, although I had no idea what they were referring to.'",

I know I know several youth who who have been pulled out from school so they can interpret it for their parents at either getting housing assistance or paying bills'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Sometimes there's no interpretation to provide at the moment. So one of our recommendation is it requires staff training to be ongoing. Staff need training and the requirements of the language access policy to either how to keep LP resident and how to keep with interpreters.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'We can work together and to achieve the same goal.

        "'speaker_8': 'I certainly have. In regards to your feelings and your thoughts on the Language Access program, we have an opportunity here. Basically, we're going to be moving into a new city hall. We're looking at the implementation of the language access program across the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have an opportunity to implement a lot of the ideas that are coming out here today. As you heard from our our director of Health and Human Services, Kate Colby, that report will be coming before the city council within the next few months.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That will be much more comprehensive. I put this an agenda here tonight so that we will get an update as to what is taking place and what are some of the continuing challenges that we might have in the very near future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Before we move into to City Hall and of course, how we can also excuse me, expand the program as a whole. I think that one of the most important aspects of this whole program is, of course, having a full time employee for an FTE to handle the Language X program, which would take care of some of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'other aspects that were raised here tonight, such as training or having liaisons in each department. I think having a full time employee to manage a language access program would be a very big step in doing that. And one of the things that I've shared with my colleagues, as well as with the city staff and the city manager'",
        "'speaker_8': ', is that we need to look at how we can fund this institutionally, meaning that it's it's it's a part of doing business with the city in regards of having a full time employee and having language access as a ongoing program that is fully funded year in, year out, without having to look at one time funding or one'",
        "'speaker_8': 'time sources or grants to keep this going. So I think it's an important aspect of our doing business in Long Beach. I heard some positive comments out there in terms of, yes, we are a diverse city. We also are diverse not only in our cultures, but diverse and linguistically in terms of all the languages that that are'",
        "'speaker_8': 'here in Long Week and Long Beach, they might not be as. Large communities as they might be like in Los Angeles or other large cities. But nonetheless, we need to be prepared and we need to have and provide access to anyone who needs it and requires it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm really pleased and happy of what's going to come in the future with our new civic center, our new state of the art library, our new civic center as a whole. With with the poor alone book as well.'",

So with that, I want to thank Stafford for the update that we have here today. But again, like I say, we have an opportunity here to really expand this program, to make it a much more functional aspect of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'what we do in the city, making it part of our of our business in terms of the cost of doing business in Long Beach. And that's to make sure that all our residents have access to information. And there's nothing much more important than that is information and communication and making sure that everybody knows what's available to them'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and having the the opportunity to not only get that service, but to have access in how and how to get additional services as well. So with that, I'll pass it on to my to my colleagues. I know there's some of you lined up that would like to speak on this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And again, I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Yes. I want to thank Councilmember Urunga for bringing this forward and for the community members to put together your fact sheet, your time, your efforts and really have been driving this. I know we talk about language access, every budget and every budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I say how important I believe that it is for a city of half a million people to really have a robust language access plan. And I think that we've you know, when we started, because I was in the community never thinking about running for office when we started this campaign many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so just echoing where we are with this, with the request, I think there are four areas. One is the quality of interpretation. Two is structurally funding it. And really, that's the city manager's office fully adopting the language access plan in every single department, in every single way that we can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The outreach and the Civic Center. So I know that from talking to staff, we're on the same page with understanding that the translation that's been provided is not accurate, but staff in public works is working on that. So I'm grateful to hear that some check is done on our list on that, on the right steps for outreach'",
        "'speaker_4': '. I wanted to ask, I know when we've done things, changes to our water bills or when election time comes and we have to do an informational piece, we've included something in our utility bill. What's that cost? And and wouldn't that be a great way to make sure that every resident knows for those utility bills?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I believe they're translated or you can request for your utility bill in a different language. Is that true? That's my question, first of all.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The information is translated, but I do not know what the cost is to do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So if the information is translated, could we then earmark or, you know, run a query and say, okay, these are the 700 people that request their water bill in Tagalog. Therefore, let's send them a mail piece that tells them, here's the process for language access at the city or a little blurb in the corner of it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just seems like that we already have a way to know that people need something in a different language, that if we use that as outreach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can add a little bit on that. So we have the ability through our utility billing to do like a 1 to 2 line as part of the actual bill that costs almost nothing. And we can put a little bit of information in that bill itself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When you're talking about putting in inserts, it depends on whether or not it requires more postage or if it's just the copying. The copying can be between seven or $10,000 to be able to put a message out to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we could work on a one line or something like that that says, you know, need translation and then whatever, you know, website landing or something that we could do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that'd be a great way to put that out there. It's it's a relatively inexpensive way to to communicate something like that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you for that. Getting to the quality of interpretation. I know that it's you know, in the community request, there's several different areas of quality, whether we're talking about the phone service or departments or we're talking about public works or how that is relayed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that there are court certified translators, and I'm just curious if that is included in our RFP whenever we work with translators. I believe the skill set that we include and in our typical vendors or that we receive from our vendors is more around community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Interpreting is a skill set rather than court interpreting. They're slightly different skill sets that require more knowledge about community. Some background research prior to the event. So I don't know that it's necessarily a part of our RF peer review process at this point to have court certified interpreters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that there's. And that wasn't something that the community members asked for. But I know that that might help us get to a another layer when we're talking about technical issues. So I don't know if there's a grading scale in our RFP process or just some information that we could include.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are you also court certified so that we can make that assessment as needed? Our staff can make that assessment as needed. Might help across the board with our translation. Yeah. We'll be looking at our new on call request for qualifications and add the quality and experience and certifications of the vendors who applied to that on call list'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Great. Thank you for that. And now, I mean, I think the biggest piece is the structural funding. I know after the last budget for council offices up here said we'll take it out of our divide by nine money if we need to, which I don't think is necessarily fair, as the entire city is a diverse city and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there are people in every single district but that it shouldn't come out of our divide by nine money. But rather, again, I'm going to echo that statement around if it's like it services, you know, that we the department can use it or not use it as needed, but that if we have a liaison or there's somebody that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is in that department that can do the translation, but it really has to be across the board so that we can really be a city that feels like we are communicating to every single one of our constituents, whether it's a language that few people speak or many.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I would wanted to clarify Miss Colby's statement. You guys are returning in 30 days with a report on the structurally funded position. Did I hear that correctly from you?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, the the report itself from the evaluation is coming. You know, we'll have that prepared in the next month or two to be able to come back. What we are finding is that the level of based on the based on the findings and the recommendations and the requests that we're hearing is that we have funding for the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'actual services where we don't have is. So, you know, if we're to do more training to build capacity in our communities, we need to have the capacity of an individual to go out and do the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Full time position.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And those kind of things. So what so that that is what we're seeing moving forward. So the council did provide us with the extra 80,000 this year that does allow us to provide additional materials more, more translate those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But to really to expand those funds, we can't fully utilize those funds unless we actually have the ability of of staffing to be able to to be able to provide those services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I guess what I'm getting to is that item that's in front of us today is a report, right, as an update on implementation. I want to be able to take the vote that says we have a full time language access person, but you guys are going to bring us a report about how our services are being'",
        "'speaker_4': 'used. And then after that would be the time for us to say, okay, it looks like we need that person and to be able to him to do the work that we said we wanted to do. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I shouldn't get crazy and put an agenda item on for next Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So make sure.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You have a report back soon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And I think, again, just to echo one more time, you know, being able to have every single department know that this is something that's a resource. And if the funding could come along those same ways, I think it would be really helpful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that training and that making sure that staff and directors know. And so I would just ask that the city manager included in there, you know, weekly emails that we get at the end of the week that all the department heads understand the process and that you guys talk about it in your team meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's a great report. Thank you guys for all your hard work. I know that this has been many years coming and I feel like we're getting a step closer and we still have a little bit more work to do, but we're getting there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you as well for the report and thank you to the coalition. I know you've been are an informal, informal committee on this and we really appreciate the advice and the all of the points on here because we think they're very valuable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would like us, you know, when we bring the report back to ensure and I know a lot of this will be addressed, but to ensure that point by point, we are specifically including an answer to each of the questions as to why or may not why or why not, that we may or may not be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'able to. I can't speak tonight. I'm very tired. Sorry. Are you saying.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So are you speaking specifically about the delay?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, the handout. So if we can just address each line by line, I know we will do that. But just specifically, so we're on the same page here. And I really see the language axis. I think we've talked about it enough, but certainly as a public safety issue, I know we talk about it in the First District'",
        "'speaker_2': 'quite a bit on even things like in terms of outreach, like Long Beach Transit. And I know that's a completely different body, but the see something, say something, you hear the police chief say it on over the intercom and just to be able to work with that jurisdiction or that agency as well, to be able to say'",
        "'speaker_2': ', can we do it in Spanish, I think is another opportunity with various other agencies. I know we're working already and the Coalition does include faith based organizations, but I think that will also help with a lot of the outreach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a committee, iPad, net TV that offers information in Spanish and hopefully if we have something in Tagalog, we are doing the outreach to provide additional. Outlets for this plan, because I would hope that when it comes back that we can talk about the language access policy in a way that's branded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So people know exactly what we're talking about. So just some thoughts there. And then in terms of timing, I know, Kelly, you had mentioned timing about one or two months that will take us, would you say maybe end of March, just so we're clear on that time frame?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. And then I would just say, if and I know you've done this before for any reason, it lasts a little bit longer. I'm sure you'll receive a two from four. That will state why it's taking a little longer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. I think everything else was addressed. But I just want to thank again the coalition and everyone that's here. And thank you as well, both Katie and Kelly and all of you for for doing the work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we appreciate you listening to the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Constance Juvenile.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I'd like to thank Councilmember Ranga for bringing the item forward and also for a great synopsis in your soliloquy there. You covered everything. But nonetheless, I'll dig deeper on this one. And also thanks to my council colleagues for signing on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thanks to the Coalition for being here tonight and for meeting with me. I really appreciate that. And to all the speakers tonight, thank you. My question is for Director Collopy and I know this is just an update, an overview, but I'd like to discuss a little bit the FTE and how we get this position full time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You and I had a discussion last week and you explain to me how this process could be streamlined or the funding mechanism is sort of already in place. So I don't want to put words in your mouth. Could you explain what we discussed last week?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the current position is funded structurally at 27 hours per week. In addition to that, we've had an ongoing $80,000 per year. It's one year, it's one time funding, but it's been coming each year, and that has been for services.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Specifically where there was an increase, the the council generously approved an additional $80,000 for this year for services within that $80,000, there is funding that could cover the full time, except that the position is currently not a full time position.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But that is that is one time funding and is not structural funding. So the shift would be utilizing would be designating a portion of that funding as structural funding and then the remainder as the as one time fund.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you. I think that helps explain how this is going to be a unique situation that we could take advantage of. And I'll just wrap up by saying that my big desire is we talk about the subtleties of the language.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The most used expression from my office is go forth, so make sure we get an accurate translation on that income. Mike, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, Sunil. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. And my my remarks will be brief. So I want to just acknowledge the change that I see here when this conversation started and it was before many of us joined this council and, you know, it was a big it was a lot of pressure, a big push to really create established language access policy'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And then the community's really been relentless and smart and strategic about making sure is at the forefront of the council's agenda, to make sure that we continue to implement this policy. And then today I acknowledge the differences. Um, you know, the Office of Equity Equity, our health department, our language access coordinator, they're on, you know, they're not'",
        "'speaker_11': 'just reflecting with the community saying they're leading on a lot of this. So we see it's just a different dynamic. It's an inside, outside approach. And I'd love to see that be that mean. That's an indication that we're beginning to institutionalize this policy a bit more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's that should be recognized. And I think as we move into the new civic center, I really think it's important that this policy is on the ground, you know, is there as we move in and it's important and will continue to be carried out as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilman, you Ranga, thank you for continue to champion these issues. I'm obviously in support of of your motion here. And we'll continue to, you know, advocate for further adoption and implementation here. So good work, Councilman Ranga, and good work, Health Department team.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And thank you to the community for your advocacy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Richardson. I also myself, I think way back when I first came in office, we're talking about language access. And it's come a long ways.

        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, the state has set up some ability for people there to exit, as I understand it, or some type of compensation that the state has set up for people who are really in distress, financial distress. So I will be trying to understand that more and provide you a report.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Remember, the peninsula is in the third district and 4th of July. The peninsula is utilized by a lot of bikers. So bicyclists. So I think maybe I don't know if that's something that we can have installed in the new bikes or if it's something that we can go in after the fact to put in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do think that's an amenity that the public would very much enjoy.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'Potentially.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And yes, actually, we had brought forward a previous item to this council in support of the purchase of bikes. We are in the final negotiation stages of that contract and we anticipate placing that order any day now. That order would consist of roughly 600 new bikes and once they come in is, as Councilmember Richardson likes to joke'",

We want to ensure that we're supporting some of our Bike Boulevard corridor projects. And one of the most recent ones, as you know, Councilman, is the Myrtle Daisy Bike Boulevard Project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So you'll see new stations going in along those corridors.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I appreciate that. Thank you very much. And I know I've been advocating for bicycles in my district in the north for for some time. It's going to be really nice to finally have them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First of all, I want to congratulate you individually for the hard work you're doing. But my biggest concern right now, you guys, is are they going to have how much are they going to require that or do the city require it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I just think that could be quite a you know, I have for those individual out on the bikes, I don't know how soon it's coming, but I know eventually it's going to have to come. So I'm just letting you guys know what you're doing now is great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But please, I know you looked for it. You looked at that way before we have, but please give us some help on that because I'd hate to see so accidents and then having that helmet I thank you guys again so much for the hard work you're doing.'",
