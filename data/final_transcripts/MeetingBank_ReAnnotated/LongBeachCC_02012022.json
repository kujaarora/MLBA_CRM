    "Study Session on City's Bicycle Infrastructure.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. With that, we will move on to the study session. That's the first item of business on the agenda. We are at the top of the agenda. And so please, let's go ahead and have turnover to staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. We are pulling up the presentation on the bike infrastructure. So I will turn to Eric Lopez to walk us through this item with his team.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Tom. Mayor, members of the city council were actually. Update today. And then in our city, I have the engineer and acting city engineer. I will take us through some of our some of the planning documents are really important to this work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then Bernd Leno, our mobility officer. Some. How can we go to the next slide? The. I mean, so the, the we spent a lot of time developing our bike master plan and we're going to do a very quick and easy refresher and similar with our Save three Long Beach Action Plan that was adopted in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It really helps us identify a lot of our focus areas where we are having a lot of safety issues with vehicles and pedestrian safety. And it's really helped ground and provide us critical data to to recommend projects and really seek funding and make improvements in targeted areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll get a little bit of air into those two major planning documents. Then we're going to talk about two of our programs, our bike share and our goal out go active Long Beach Hub program. And then we're going to talk about projects both recently completed, some that are in the pipeline and we are expecting a lot'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of more funding opportunities that are going to be made available as part of the Federal Infrastructure Fund. And we want to be ready for that. So with that, Roseman will take us through the next slide. Carl. Thank you, Eric.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead and go to the next slide, please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. You know, I've worked for four different agencies over the course of my career. And as you probably know, the city of Long Beach really is supportive of our bicycle community, folks who are out riding the the roadway network and the trails in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the past. You know, we we really make a good effort here in the city of Long Beach to support those folks. And we do have a bicycle master plan. It was adopted by the city city council in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It really focused on equity mode, shift sustainability and safety. As a city traffic engineer and acting city engineer, for me, safety is the number one priority. The plan really is to have a vision to shift 30% of all trips to bicycle trips in the course of 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we want to create an 80 to 80 bicycle network. It is connected, safe and convenient. When we say 1880, that really means we want a bicycle network that is comfortable for anyone to ride from the age of eight to the age of 80.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All different types of riders and users. It needs to be comfortable and safe for all of those users. And of course, we want to continue to implement bike friendly programs that support everything that we're working on with the master plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a picture of the front cover of the master plan there on the bottom. Next slide, please. Now, the the bicycle masterplan really goes hand in hand with the safe streets Long Beach action plan that we adopted in city council back in July of 2020.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Vision Zero policy's goal is to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries by 2026. The plan focuses really on the vulnerable road users who are really at a higher risk folks like pedestrians and bicycles, bicyclists. The Action Plan focuses on resources, speeding design, education, data equity in different partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, there's the front cover of the Safe Streets plan there at the bottom of the slide. And you can see the map on the right shows some of the what we call hotspots, where we've identified corridors or intersections where we have a high prevalence of collisions that are taking place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We we compiled the data that we have regarding the types of collisions. And we come up with these types of what we call heat maps. Next slide, please. So the safe streets, Long Beach Action Plan, really, we are we are looking at bicyclists who are overrepresented in the crash data, unfortunately.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We survey feedback, emphasizing the need for separation between bikeways and vehicular traffic. We look at roadways with bikeways that are typically redesigned to reduce speeding. Bicycle infrastructure can improve safety for drivers as well as speeds come down on a lot of the roadways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, it not only makes it safer for pedestrians and bicyclists, but it makes it safer for drivers who are in vehicles as well. And that's really important, again, for all users. Since 2020, some of our achievements we've received 19 million for roadway safety improvement projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Last year we started a yard design education program and we were really kind of unsure how this was going to take off and whether it would be popular. But it has shown to be very popular. And we have staff who meets with residents delivering signs and instructing them how to put them in their yards or along the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'side the sides of the roadway. Also, we have been successful in reducing speed limits. So far, we've done 29 road segments just recently in the past nine months or so, and we're on course to do another 30 or so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is where we can legally and justifiably reduce speed limits anywhere in the city. We have a program where we are looking at doing that every year. So these are some of the things that we're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our next slide. Okay. So now we'll have Fern come in. She is the lead for the mobility team. Fern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Now that we've discussed some of the city's guiding documents, I'm going to provide some information on bicycle related programs and then the projects. So go active. I'll be Hub is a city owned bike commuter bike commuter parking facility is located downtown that you can see here next to the first Street Transit Gallery.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city contracts with a local vendor had on movement to operate the facility, and we offer monthly and annual commuter parking memberships available to the public. We offer 24/7 secure and monitored indoor bike parking. There's also a restroom and showers available for members free monthly bike safety workshops open to the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we also discuss bike registration. We have service and repairs, retail and other information on the city's bicycle network and programs that we we give out to people through this facility. Next slide, please. Now our bike share program has been very successful over the last several years, and I want to provide some program metrics from 2021'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We had almost 600 total buy from the system last year and we refurbish almost 600 also in 2021. We have a total of 96 hubs operating now and during the summer, when we have the highest use in bike share, we see that Belmont Pier, Juniper Lot, 54th place, the Aquatic Center and the Aquarium of the Pacific are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the most utilized hubs in the city. We've had almost 50,000 trips last year and almost 250,000 total miles of road. And we've seen our active membership increase year over year with around 30,000 active members in 2018. 40,000 in 20 1940.'",
        "'speaker_1': '6000 in 2020. And as you can see here, almost 60,000 active memberships in 2021. And writers, they have the option to pay per ride or they can purchase a bike share membership. And we also offer student discounts available to one big city, Cal State.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anyone who has a dot edu email address. Next slide, please. In 2021, we signed a new contract with Heron Movement as our vendor to operate and maintain the program. The contract is through September 2023 and it also includes refurbishment of the recently purchased fixture.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We intend to expand the bike share program this year starting in May, and this expansion will include up to 1500 new controllers that will allow QR codes to unlock the bikes. And we're also excited to introduce electric bicycles into the bike share program this year with about 100 to 150 added to the fleet this upcoming year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also be adding in 700 non-electric bikes that will be refurbished and added into the system with the addition of new bike parking hubs installed citywide. And those have we'll be able to accommodate the new e-bikes and the existing non electric bike tricycles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. So this map shows the existing bikeways across the city. The rest from the map are the shared routes and the painted bike lanes and the green are the facilities that Karl mentioned earlier, which includes recreational paths and trails, separated and parking, protected bike lanes and bike boulevards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In 2021, the port completed construction on the pier and Jay Path, which is one and a half miles. And we completed a bike lane on Temple Avenue. And then in addition to that, short segments on Alamitos and Cherry were constructed by private developers as required conditions of approval for the adjacent development projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. These are the upcoming bikeway projects that we have that are a citywide effort that we plan to complete over the next three years. The total mileage for all 15 of these projects is about 33 miles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The grant funded projects are big projects that were awarded funding through a Caltrans active transportation program. Skaggs Sustainable Communities Program and Metro Measure a active transportation program. The repaving projects are bike projects that were added onto the already planned repaving work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the local return funded are bike projects that are not connected to a repaving project, but that are paid through local water and transportation dollars. A majority of these projects are separated bike lanes, but we also have a few others like Pine of the Bike Boulevard Project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then, as I mentioned earlier, we are anticipating release of a few different grant applications this year. A Cycle six will open this summer and we do intend to apply for several bicycle projects through that grant program again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. I just want to talk about a few of the upcoming projects and a little bit more detail. You can see this one is an HP project at the downtown walkable corner. And the intent of this project is to improve comfort and visibility, both for pedestrians and bicyclists.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it also threw some of these both out to encourage safer vehicle turns. We have concrete medians that will help fortify the separated bike lanes along third and Broadway. And this is a really good example of the city's effort to upgrade our temporary striping and green bollard elements to more permanent concrete treatments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you can see here we have 190 curb extensions and pedestrian medians that will be proposed throughout the downtown area. Magnolia, Alameda, seventh and Ocean are the limits. And that photo there is a rendering of some of what the intersections will look like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. Another ATP project. Here is our Pacific Avenue cycle track. This will extend from Ocean Boulevard to Pacific Coast Highway, which is identified as a high injury corridor on the district phone reduction funding. So that map earlier on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For bikes and pedestrians from a high injury network map. This project includes Bass Islands. You can see here on the photo on the right and shorter pedestrian crossings, separated bikeways and additional traffic calming elements. And through this project, we hope to have reduced vehicle speeding and reduce dwell time and then also create a more comfortable experience for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bicyclists. Next plan. And then the third project that was awarded through ETP recently is the Pine Avenue Bike Boulevard Project, and this extends from Eighth Street to Willow Street, which will help us connect downtown to the Willow Street Metro Line Station, which is a gap that's identified in our bicycle master plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is a project that will create a suitable bike route for each 80 people, ages 8 to 80. So we're excited about this one. Also, the bike boulevards will use SROs and other traffic calming elements to create a comfortable place for bicyclists to share the road with the local vehicle traffic that rides on the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we'll do this through vehicle diverter sprays, intersections, traffic circles, rapid flashing beacons, curb extensions and pedestrian medians. You can see in the photo here, this is the proposed diverter at Eastern Time, and that's to help us with the reduced cut through traffic and speeding and improved comfort for everyone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. And so this is the last project that we wanted to highlight in more detail. This was included as part of a repaving project. This is Del Alma Boulevard. And this is part of our effort to move away from the bollards and the paint towards more concrete, more permanent concrete elements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a one way bike lane that's adjacent to a school and will help bring vehicle speeds down. This will be from Atlantic Avenue to Orange Avenue and it is a separated bikeway using concrete separated. You can see the photo in Portland here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is funded through local transfer and return funds. And another really exciting thing about this project is that it will connect our Orange Avenue and Atlantic Avenue bikeways. Next slide, please. So the Bicycle Master Plan has a target goal to construct 300 miles of bikeways by 2040, and we currently have approximately 165 miles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can see in this chart that in order to reach that goal, the city needs to build approximately eight miles per year. In 2019, we had our highest recent year when we constructed three miles. That was in Second Street, Audenshaw and East Broadway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can also see in the chart that we'll focus on building more Class four, which is the separated by claims in the coming year. So you can see the GRE at the top, how most of the future projects are the class for the gray and we'll have kind of a reduction of the class two, which is the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'second from the bottom shade of blue there. So we'll be converting most of the projects to pass for instead of be the shared route. So just so everyone knows. Class four are the separated by claims, and then class two are just the painted by claims as the separate lane, but not separated by any vertical element and then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'class three of the shared routes. That's where we have sheroes. And then one are the paths and trails. So that would be a separate path similar to the ones along the two rivers and the beach path. We also are trying to focus on what we are considering low hanging fruit projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have about 18 miles of those and those are existing class two lanes that we can upgrade to separated bike lanes. In the future. May our future. Next slide, please. So how we hope to achieve this. This goal is by continuing to get some of these projects awarded by Grantham, considering some of these is both low hanging'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fruit and more permanent projects. Over the past decade, we have focused more on the temporary materials birth, separated by claims as kind of pilot projects to see how they worked out and they've been pretty successful. But we do know that we'd like to transition to the bottom there, which is the best practice for some of these operated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'infrastructure projects, those ones there that have either parking or vertical kind of concrete separation. Those are more comfortable, more permanent and more esthetically pleasing for us to do in the streets. However, they are far more costly. As you can see the price comparison here between the quick build of having the best practice one on the bottom there'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And then the next slide is just a last slide here. We want to show you some more examples of best practice bikeway design. These ones use more permanent materials and really make bicyclist and pedestrians feel more comfortable. Clockwise from the top left.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's San Francisco, California. That's the concrete median separated bike lane. And then Cambridge, Massachusetts, that's a sidewalk grade separated bike lane. Chicago, Illinois, that's a protected intersection. And then Saint Paul, Minnesota, that's the sidewalk grade separated by Clinton as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And these are really important designs for us because we know that they attract a broader portion of the population and they enhance comfort for all users and improve accessibility for people with limited mobility. Next slide, please. Okay. Well, that concludes our presentation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much for this opportunity to present an update on our bicycle infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council that concludes our presentation were available to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Motorcar and and to the staff to get you really a great job as you always do want to just overall to say that the work that's happened on this has been really incredible to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you and I have talked about how important it is to continue our mobility projects or our production oriented projects and just great to see all the expansion. So just a huge kudos to the team and this market to you and everyone working on all these projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I may have some more questions and I want to turn to the council to your question. So I've councilman's in the house first.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Great presentation, STAFF. Thank you very much for all the hard work that you've been doing. It just really excites me to see so much good planning put into this. It's just such a great, great presentation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also wanted to ask a couple of things. I know that in the past and I'm going to use my home as an example, there was a bike lane that was created there and now I am no longer able to access the vehicles that are wheelchair accessible to be able to transport me or they don't have somewhere'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to wait for me because they're blocking the bike lane. How did you guys take that into consideration? And if so, what is the plan for for something like that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unaccompanied.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you need me to clarify, I'd be more than happy to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I can address that, Councilwoman. And, um, you know, with all of our projects, there are always sometimes details that fall through the cracks. And that's something that that we didn't know about, we weren't aware about early on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, when we do have special conditions that arise, we always come back after the project is installed to try and remedy those situations, to mitigate those issues. So if you let me know where you need to have something done, you know, we can definitely try to help you out there for sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we try to catch these things early on in the process, but sometimes it's slipped through the cracks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Yes. Thank you. And being a big advocate for the disability community, I think that my my fellow disability community members would agree with me that we've been working really, really, really hard to actually be up for thought and not an afterthought.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I've been more involved with you guys and try to pinpoint things because it's not only in my house, you know, I've seen other seniors trying to get picked up, for example, by dialysis and they have nowhere to park because they are now blocking the bike lane.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when they are there and they're blocking the bike lane, the bikers have to get out of the bike lane, around the vehicle and back into the bike lane, which puts everybody involved. So. Mr. Hickman, I look forward to continuing this conversation off line and making sure that we address that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Sara.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Hickman. And with it, turn for the presentation. I'm sorry. There's somebody I want to make sure I get the claims right. Yes, sir. Thank you. So I appreciate the report back on the bicycle masterplan, as well as how it connects back to the Vision Zero plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I think ultimately what I want to make sure everybody in some level of mobility have safe form of it. And I appreciate the opportunity to look into how we're not only just creating safer bike path, but how we're considering improving our stormwater in that way too, in order to efficiently, efficiently and capture water and make sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that they're clean. And one of the things that I think that is important, too, is connectivity. It's how are the bike paths ultimately also connecting to the L.A. River? Because I do know that there are some people who may want that as an optional commute into the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to make sure that that is an opportunity we look at. And I just want to make sure that we consider Rivers and Mountains Conservancy as an option of funding that does provide funding into that in addition to federal funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Austin. Thank you. And also want to just move my. Appreciation to the staff for their view of the presentation on this plan. We we, I think, should talk more about our. But in active transportation models.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And certainly I support the investment that we've been able to make thus far in our city. Been a long champion of active transportation and mobility connectivity throughout our city. I think that the priority, one big priority that we should should always not lose focus on and not just the safety of our our children, the young people, and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'making sure that they have safe access to ride their bikes to or from school to or from our parks, playgrounds. And we should put put them first. I think also what I hear from a lot of our our constituents is, you know, they'd like to see some consistent application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. You know, there are there are corridors where bike lanes look one way on one stretch and then they change to whole another design along the same street. And it may provide some level of protection and safety for one corridor, one section of a corridor, but it's that level of protection and safety changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think it's very, very important for us as we move forward to not just look at new opportunities, but we need to reevaluate the infrastructure, the infrastructure that we already have to and improve upon it and make it as consistent as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I've had the good fortune of working with the traffic engineers, you know, literally over the last ten years on the city council. And I've understood that there are different philosophies and ways to do things. And so consistency is something that I'd like to see more of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then understanding as I talk about the the infrastructure that we already have, we need to make sure that that that infrastructure is well maintained. Right. I don't think it defeats the purpose to say, hey, we're going to build new bike infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If the existing infrastructure bollards are missing. Paint is not not clear in on the on the streets. So I'd like to see us put a lot more emphasis on that that type of those type of improvements and ongoing maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it would be critical to to improving safety, but also consistent with our our Vision Zero plan. Those are my comments. And I look forward to working with our traffic engineer public works department to to meet those those and in the weeks and months to come.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember a councilwoman price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So it's almost as if Councilman Austin and I had three determine what our our thoughts are going to be tonight. Because as he was talking, I was I cued up early because here's the thing. And first of all, thank you for the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I tell everyone at every community meeting, our traffic engineers are actual engineers. They're experts whose opinion we should absolutely rely upon and support in terms of what recommendations they bring to the table. And I do what in my field is called the foundation for their expertize, because a lot of times our traffic and neighbors make recommendations'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that are not popular with certain communities because I don't know about the rest of my colleagues, but traffic is a major issue and every one of my community meetings and everyone has a traffic mitigation solution that they think is the best one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But a lot of times it's not the same one that our traffic engineer is. The one is recommending like stop signs. Everybody wants stop signs all the time to slow down speed. And we know from our engineers that that's not what stop signs do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In regards to bikes, we are at a bicycle infrastructure. We're at a place now where just a few years ago, we went through a very painful process, which I call the era of the bollard. And I know Councilwoman Mungo can back me on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sure all of my council colleagues, if they had installed in their districts, are aware of the era of the bollards. So I felt like I was because we have amazing city staff in terms of your education, your background, people that are very thoughtful and the recommendations that they give.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so a lot of times council members, I defer to city staff a lot because you have the expertize that that I don't have and I'm very mindful of that. And I don't want to second guess what you're recommending, but it looks like we're no longer using bollards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so what happens to all the bollards that we have already in the city is the plan that at some point down the road will replace those bollards with that little cushion that we have. Talk to me a little bit, Mr. Hickman, about bollards, and promise me that you're never going to leave the city because we want'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to have consistency with every application. And if that's what the bump that we're doing now is, is a good application that everyone can stand behind, then I'd love to see that be the new standard, but let's let's talk a little bit about that because I don't like that there's inconsistency in look.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For me, it's the look. It just makes the city look messy. It doesn't make us look like we have a cohesive plan. It's the same thing with the colors of the ADA ramps. Some are gray, summer yellow. I know we've talked about that, but consistency would be good as we move towards, you know, this concept of equity'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Because I think it's really important that the city overall from one side of the city to the other side of the city has same access, same safety features, all of that. So, Mr. Heckman, can you talk a little bit about that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Councilman Price and Councilman Austin, I totally understand what you're saying about the need for consistency throughout the city. And as a matter of fact, we are currently right now working on developing citywide standard plans and citywide standard specifications that we're going to use on all of our projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, in regards to bollards, yes. In the past there was quite a few green bollards installed on major corridors and we are leaning towards not doing that. And if you see bollards now, you'll be able to see them maybe at the beginning or the end of a particular segment or a or a block.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you're not going to see that long continuous line like you see on some of our roadways. So in place of that, we do need of some sort of a vertical element, which is what a bother provides you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we are going to be moving towards the more concrete, flatter vertical element that is that separator between the traveled way and the bike lane. Those concrete elements seem to work well, but I want to point out that those type of concrete vertical elements will only be installed where we don't have parking because we don't want to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'create trip hazards with people tripping over wheel stops or vertical concrete elements. So yes, we are definitely moving away from the typical bollards that you're talking about, but you will still see an occasional bother here and there. It provides additional level of safety right at the intersections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I hope I answer your question. Good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You did, and I appreciate that. And I think whatever we do, I'm happy to support as long as we have a longer term plan, because our term on the council is council members is limited by the staff's terms in their roles are limited as they move.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we need to have some sort of plan so that the city doesn't look like it's disjointed or fractured from one part of the city to the other. Because then as we get into issues where the city doesn't have a consistent image, and I think that's important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Agree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next up is council member your Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. Good discussion so far. But as many of you know, I'm colorblind. So it was hard for me to follow some of those lines where you had it red and green going north, east, west, where they were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was hard for me to follow in that respect. Yes. Information in place for future presentations. And I'm not the only one I know. There's probably a lot of people out there with a red green color like me having a hard time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And having said that, I couldn't tell if there were any bike lanes in the west part of the city, in the west side, as an example. There's there's a dearth. I drive it a lot, set up a corridor and set up a corridor, goes to report all the way to downtown Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I didn't see anything that even resembled a bike lane in that in that area. There's also some issues in regards to connect connectivity with the West Long Beach area. There's no biking that goes from, say, Pacific to Santa Fe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And of course, there's only four points of. Contact and I PCH will award Wardlow does have a bike lane of course it's littered that had a high propensity of ballots all over on both sides of the street. So that's another issue in and of itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's the only seems to be the only corridor, if you want to call it that, that connects East LA, which, if you will, with West Long Beach, and that's the only one. And then there's no there's nothing on Santa Fe for a, say, a bicyclist to connect to Santa Fe and then go from there to either'",
        "'speaker_0': 'towards downtown the river or to downtown L.A.. So I think that we need to look at that that bicycle plan a little, a little more before inclusionary. Obviously, equity is a big issue with us in Long Beach and and especially when it comes to the West Long Beach area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would want to work with with you, Mr. Hickman. And in regards to what we can do to resolve that, there's of bike lanes in West Palm Beach. Thank you. Councilman Tharanga, if I could respond real, real brief.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do have class three bike lanes getting installed on Santa Fe are coming up this this year. That's part of the improvement project there. But the class threes again are with the shareholders in the roadway, notifying drivers that they should share the road with bicyclists.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There isn't a dedicated lane, but we do have a project in the works. Hopefully we get funding to put a bike lane over the Willow Bridge and I am happy to say that with the Shoemaker Bridge that we're constructing, we are bringing and connecting the folks from the west side to the east.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There will be a bike path over the Shoemaker Bridge that will drop down and you can access it on the west side at the southern end of Fashion Avenue. So we are working on those kind of activities to the West Side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're working on it. Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thanks to Carl and Fern for the presentation and a long time in the works, he's made tremendous progress. You know, I remember when a lot of this was planned, you know, was plans and funding identified.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we're in a different place now where we see a real difference on the orientation of our bike lanes, you know? You know, active transportation is the goal. And we have to make sure that we have the facilities in place to ensure that, you know, one can participate in our in our network safely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I remember the conversations earlier were particularly in uptown, all of all of the the lanes were North-South or had a North-South orientation. It was how can we connect uptown to downtown? But the reality and the experience of the people using using those lanes was that they didn't all just want to go downtown or go to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the beach. Folks in North Palm Beach wanted to go west or go east. L.A. River, the San Gabriel Valley River. There were already routes to get to get downtown to the river and needed to. But what I've seen is a lot of now the plans really show a lot more east west orientation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's good. But I think we definitely need to talk about implementation and making sure that the plans do become a reality for people who truly, truly care about transportation equity and are looking to use a bike or whatever means to get where they need to get to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because there is still a disconnect, in my opinion, between the infrastructure that we plan, what we implement and all the strategies implemented. For example, you know, it took a long time to get the bike network to extend to North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's still a lot more work to do to make sure that those resources, the bikes, you know, even the scooters are in places where our communities can access them. I think, you know, the issue of schools was was raised a bit earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we have to maintain our conversations with the school district to maintain our emphasis on favor of the school. The bollards were implemented first on Artesia Boulevard because of a need to make the Artesia Bridge safer. Between Jordan High School and starting elementary school.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They were never supposed to be a permanent solution. And then we saw that they went citywide. Well, we don't want the bollards forever. I know that we've got work on hand with Artesia Boulevard that are going to make them, you know, make permanent enhancements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But, you know, but what I want to emphasize is that this was because the walk over that bridge was so unsafe for the students, we needed to have some sort of a partition between traffic and a very narrow sidewalk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we got out of it was we use that as an opportunity extends sidewalks. We gave you know, we got red rose barbecues and patio dining through the process. They were the first ones in the North Miami Beach area to have that happen as the traffic jams were too high for a parklet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we did a curb extension. We used active transportation as a means to create some economic opportunity. Those were good. We got to keep doing that. And so I wanted to so my message here is let's, you know, great progress in the planning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have to continue to apply for funding to make these projects become a reality. You know, our neighborhoods and many you know, I can talk about North Palm Beach. The neighborhoods are great. It's the business corridors. It's the corridors, the lack of attention.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And it's the same way in a lot of areas. The homes are great. But when you look at some of the corridors, they need attention. And without redevelopment, sometimes the only funding we get is the funding we can apply for for the public realm, street projects, widening sidewalks, pedestrian lighting I that make it safer also make'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it more beautiful. And so those are my that's my encouragement was make sure we apply for the dollars that you get as much bang for the buck as we can in the areas that certainly need, you know, based on data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But, you know, the areas that are using this this infrastructure, the areas that businesses could use, you know, some some enhancement because we've seen what happens. It makes a real difference. I mean, Rob Earls is an example. Last name, Carl, if you could just give us a quick update.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where are we with the RTG project? That's a very good question. Vice Mayor Richardson, we were looking at the 100% design plan today with the designer and going over and making sure that they dotted all the I's and cross all the T's and addressed all of our comments from prior submittal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the 100% design is in the design team that is going to go back, make a few minor adjustments. And then we're looking to advertise between March and June of this year for the RFP for construction. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we can see that up a little more. I think that's better because we've what we originally talked about was put on the street in Q one. Yeah. So and it's closely phasing the project. Yes. So you get as much bang for the buck as you can get.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right around Jordan High School. Exactly. You know, we're going to be phasing it in two pieces, but we're making great progress right now. Fantastic. Thank you. Big, grave controversy for now, please. And thank you. The topic of bollards was of little interest to me, but for redistricting, there wasn't a single ballot in the fourth district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now I just inherited a tunnel. So what I'd like to ask is if, in fact, we're looking at a redesign or removing those, if we could look at options that do not require a specialized street sweeper. It sort of looked like that low version might work well with traditional street super, so you don't have to answer it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'today. If you could look into those possibilities. And I do remember above what the vice mayor was saying, and that was one of the pet peeves that they would call right off the bat is there was no way of cleaning that thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Originally, when those bollards first went up on Artesia as major hazard with gravel and whatnot collecting in the bike lane, and I'd love to see improvements in that area. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. I think that we do have a motion by Councilperson for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I can get a second, that would be great. And I have some comments and questions as well. First, I agree with almost one step further by the Council's really great comments. Mr.. Mr.. Modica, can you go ahead and just put up the of the shot of all the upcoming projects by projects coming up with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. We'll get that on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Slide ten.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there is a second by councilwoman. So, Councilman, do you have anything to add if you want to say anything else?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Me. Yes. Oh, no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you for that for the second there. Greg, this is this is this is really great. Thank you very, very much for this. So so I wanted to just do first of all, this is a lot of stuff that one of the things I think that we're hoping for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot of us are hoping for is I think a lot of us were around back when the city was first experimenting. And we were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think about like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten years ago, we were just barely getting started. 15 years ago, the city was just getting started, having these conversations around like infrastructure and around what the city would look like. And I want to credit I know then Vice Mayor Susan Lowenthal really what I thought was kind of like the city thought if you're around bikes, you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'work with folks like Mark Bixby and so many other folks in getting our master plan to where it is today and so many others across the across the country. What I hope is I'm looking at this plan as far as the upcoming bikeway projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's super it's super exciting to see this. I want to say a couple of things. One is we should continue to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Link.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our bike projects as well to the impacts around around housing and climate change. And they're all linked. The more we can get folks to travel safely, it does have impacts air quality and does have impacts to the way housing is developed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so those are always really important things for us to consider. One of the big reasons why these projects are so important. Also, I want to echo the conversations around reinvesting back into bike and bike lane projects that are really need, as we touched on a little a little paint ball replacement, some of the things that we're'",
        "'speaker_0': 'discussing as far as bollard replacement, which I know I love to hear that from. I'm not a huge fan, but I understand why those put in place, what actually we replace those with. Yes, Mr. Mayor, when those vertical elements, the bollards are damaged, or let's say we were to do a wholesale removal, we would we would need'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to replace those with some sort of a vertical element. And I mentioned earlier that we're leaning towards that concrete vertical element. It's not really a curb. It's actually quite mountable by a car. But it does provide that vertical separation between the travel lane and the bicycle lane.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's a concrete flatter than a normal curb concrete installed with pavement or with the project. And then you can also do other things like we tried wheel stops and on some of our bike projects, but in some areas of the city, the residents complained that the wheel stops were actually trip hazards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we had to go back and remove those as well. So, you know, again, you need some sort of a vertical element and we are leaning towards that concrete vertical element. That's great. Thank you. And I tell you that I think some of these projects that are that are on here, I remember years ago, some of these'",
        "'speaker_0': 'projects were not eligible or there is different perspective on whether or not a bike lane could be implemented, including the one on Pacific. I think I'm really glad to see that. But I remember being on the council and that was not a possible bike lane area back then and I'm glad that things have changed and a little'",
        "'speaker_0': 'more progressive bike policy and locations. I want to also just add their gear doing a major, for example, I see there on Studebaker a big part of that Studebaker grant funded bike lane project, I'm assuming, aligned with our repave of Studebaker that we're working on right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that correct? Yes, that is correct. And we're trying to do the the pavement and the installation of the class for bike lane so that, you know, we don't do redundant work or one one type of task doesn't damage the other work that is done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that is getting installed on Studebaker the class for thank you and then the you know what's missing on here which. You know, I mentioned before and I wish we were able to include it. We're also working on a major review of Anaheim.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All the way from Zamfara to the western side of the city and not a fully funded project, but getting more funded project, I think. And so. Will you remind me why we're not included any sort of bike lane project on our home?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, that's a very good question. And Anaheim is a very unique corridor because we don't have the road with on a lot of the segments to allow to have the lanes that we need to accommodate the volumes of traffic and then the additional width to accommodate bike lanes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we're doing with the Anaheim Improvement Project is we're installing other types of improvements that are that are consistent with complete streets and active transportation where we're doing a lot of improvements at the intersections. And those improvements will help bicyclists and pedestrians and motorists.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So also when folks try to cross the street, cross Anaheim, they're going to have islands and medians in the middle for bicyclists and for pedestrians to act as a refuge. So they're not just jumping across the street into traffic, which I love, by the way, because those are incredibly complete street projects that are happening all up and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'down on through the great. But Anaheim is very wide, and I know that there's a mixed opinion about whether whether bike lanes could go into that project. And so there are other streets where we've installed bike lanes that are much narrower than Anaheim, which is, I believe, one of the wider streets we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm just wondering if it campaign valuation of that or is there a bigger issue, a bigger safety issue that they'd like to see? Well well, to get the road to get the bike lanes in there, like, say, a class four, you would have to do a road diet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's there's no other way around that. We don't want to condemn businesses or take people's property to gain additional with in many of the locations. So you would have to go down to a single lane each direction. And we all know how busy Anaheim is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It would greatly impact the vehicular traffic flow along that entire corridor. It'd be quite a mess, quite frankly, if we went down to one lane in each direction. So that is the challenge, you know, road width and eating the road to carrying and having that capacity for the vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's a tradeoff and it's a challenge. All right. Gary Mayor Eric Lopez. I was just going to ask if Karl can talk a little bit about, you know, that East West connection and the importance that and if it can't happen on Anaheim, some of the other areas that the bike master plan looks at that can help'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with that connection. You know, of course, it's going to be safe. It will be convenient. But I, I just want to make sure that when people look at this map, that they know that we recognize the importance of that East West connection and that we do have plans that that we're looking at to ensure that happens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But let me just add to that, that that's really also I think the key piece of this is when you think about the communities between Anaheim and PCH and along that corridor, you have some of our densest, most lower income communities in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to make sure that those folks are being are have access to safe bike ways to get to get from one end of the city to the other and to go east west. So I know that we have some incredible bike infrastructure along the coast even.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we're building some great, great linkages on 14th. We have incredible bikeway. I think I'm on six, but I do I continue to be concerned about the ability for folks that are along Midtown, along Cambodia, towns through the center of the city to have access to safe pedestrian transportation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so interstate bike access. So just just want to put it out there. I know I've mentioned the city before. It's fantastic job with all this. This is looking really great. I just wanted to look that up and continue moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Michael.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. Sorry that I had some technical difficulties earlier. I'd like to think that there is some value in discussing. Where are the path to lead when they get to the city edges? So you'll see that there was a discussion of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Specifically that it goes the eastward boundary or the city's northern boundary. It's very valuable to have those connected to other bike infrastructure in the adjacent cities and for US council members to work with the adjacent elected to ensure that there is connectivity so that individuals in those parts of Southern California can bike to Long Beach to experience'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Some of the corridors that Mr. Richardson was discussing. So just something to think about. And then I think that we're really excited about the opportunity to have standardization of the bulb outs and standardization of the coloring and standardization of where we do what classes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also think there needs to be an exception process. If you look at a project that I'm really, really proud of on Viking Way, those bulb out and that additional safety measures could not have been possible if we would have had to wait for the funding to be able to do it via concrete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did an experiment. We did it with paint and other visual aids that got us there. But that project was originally and ended up being around half a million dollars, and we would have done those bulb outs that have been significantly more expensive with the concrete, and it probably wouldn't have gotten done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there are times when the priorities of the city are such where a project of that magnitude growing by 25% would not be possible. And so I think we need to look at when and where those exceptions can be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Made and what that looks like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And finally, Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I'm just following up on what the mayor was just speaking about. When I'm looking at the second district, I see some significant gaps, especially from north to south. And as we know, these gaps are in some of our densest neighborhoods in central Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So is there, like any timeline or. I guess it's just kind of a follow up question to what you already asked, too. Like, how are we going to address these these gaps that I'm seeing on this map?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we typically do, Councilwoman Allen, as we are aware of where we have those those type of gaps that you're talking about. And as projects are developed and as and as project funding comes along, however that arrives, we do try to fill in those gaps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do have about six projects that we're going to be applying for this coming year for projects. I'm getting into all those details. But with many of our projects, we fill in those gaps as best as we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, it's a corridor by corridor basis, and we look to do that. And on the west side of the city, there's a lot happening up against the river, you know, with the Shoemaker Bridge and the Drake Park improvements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there are a variety of things happening in the downtown area as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I understand that you're aware of the gaps, and I trust that you'll you know, that you'll find ways that you can fill them when you can. But is do you have is there like in any timeline for this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, there's no real timeline to say that, you know, everything will be done by act by year X. You know, we do have a goal to to try to get this complete master plan done by, say, 2040. But again, it's piece by piece, developer by developer, project by project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we sort of piece it together the best that we can as as funding is available and as the projects come together as one agree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just want one other question. I know I look at the the the go active Long Beach Hub is great but we only have one. What are we doing to provide more secure parking and storage elsewhere in the city?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then also, is there something that we could do to like incorporate in any of the city owned parking structures or locked in to secure parking?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that's a tough question. You know, right now we do have the one hub, as you mentioned, and it's, um, it costs us a little bit of money to keep that thing up and running. And it's really a unique setup there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, we would be open to looking for other areas, other sections of town to set up similar hubs. And we do have bike parking in the city structures right now in the Hamilton I'm sorry, the Lincoln Garage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, again, we are working on those things and as as opportunities arise, we try to fit them in wherever we can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much, Carl.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Compliment. Can I just add a little bit more to that in now? I have two things. First, you know, we have we do have a lot of parking assets, but I think we can do a better job with providing more secure bicycle parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know that that is an area where our mobility officer and public works is going to be looking at working with our partner, with our parking team and see what we can do. The second part, um, big grant opportunities like the active transportation program that the state administers that comes every two years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, in terms of the question of, you know, how often do we get the opportunities? Do proposed projects compete for funding to be able to do some of these bigger improvements? You know, it's right now it's happening every three years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are expecting more funding to come under those programs because of the federal infrastructure bill. So, you know, I think we're in a unique place. We have our planning documents in place. We know where our gaps are. We know where our where where we can do a better job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with all of this additional funding coming in, I really think it's an exciting time to to compete for some of these funds, bring some of this funding in and be able to get a lot more of these projects completed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I, I just wanted to lift that up and just point that out because, you know, not every year that we get to compete, it's been every two years for the last 4 to 6 years for us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think thank you, Eric, for all your hard work on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and councilman for. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the mayor's question about Anaheim and Cindy Allen's question about North-South. So and this happened on my watch. So Anaheim was deemed not appropriate for bike lanes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they chose 15th Street. And that bike lane goes from Magnolia on the West all the way to Cal State line, which actually jumps out of the north up to Atherton, then over on the way to Studebaker. So that was the alternative for the Anaheim Street Bike Lane and for Cindy Allan Obispo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And staff can talk about this. This was just completed recently, but I believe I'm not I know it's the fourth District. I know the bike lane goes from 10th to PCH, but it might go even further than that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so there's a good North-South route right in the middle of the second District section that goes up to PCH. Thanks. You can count on her for those good updates. That concludes council comments on this very session. Is there any public comment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At this time. If there's any members of the public that like to speak on this item, please use this raise hand feature or press star nine. We have three public comments. Dave Shuker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time starts now. Great. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can you?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Good evening. Thanks for the opportunity to comment on this. Very, very, very good presentation, Mr. HIGGINS. Mrs.. Thank you. So that you can better judge and evaluate what I'm saying. I should note that Vision Zero is something that I have been tracking since Director Con in New York City when I was living there first proposed it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and it's something I did research on in 2016, 2017 at UCLA. I very much would like to see Complete Streets on Studebaker. I'm glad to see that there's funding for that. I think the point about the Santa Fe Corridor, using the Alameda Corridor and having not just bike lanes but complete streets on the west side would be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'really great using the L.A. River as a form of connectivity, not just for bikes, but multimodal connectivity. I think it's something that should be explored on both banks. Things like the DeForest Parkway, for instance, are really going to lead in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's good to see the traffic safety issues, especially on Vision Zero, have been identified where they're most concentrated on the borders between the first, second and the six districts. 35 saved lives. Speed limit restrictions are helpful, and they're legally and justifiably possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should do it. To go back to pub is gorgeous. That is a wonderful use of space. Great program metrics on some of these slides, including the co-benefits for the cost of emissions. A lot of win win win scenarios.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's great to see. I think the city should own site and maintain its own manufacturing capacity for active transportation and multi-modal connectivity. So I'd like to ask, you know, with the 100 250 new e-bikes, are these connected any charging stations or prefiguring things like light monorail or something?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, where are these things are going to be located? Because, you know, we've had some problems with some of these electric scooters. The rollout was a bit of a mess. And I hope that their safety and risk model for adding these new e-bikes to the roads.'",

I represent IBEW Electrical Workers Local 11, and we're in full support of the item that's in front of you tonight. Item number 25. This project, Cranberries Culinary Group's project, has come a long way through the process.'",

We appreciate primary group on committing project labor agreement with Chris Hammond in the building trades and also housing prevailing wage included in this process.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Really excited about this project. I know it's been a long time coming, but I know that this is going to be so good as an affordable housing, as a housing advocate for for the city and for many, many years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am so excited to see one so many units coming to this location, but I'm especially excited to see it go from 10% affordable house help affordable units to 100% affordable units. And that's a big deal. And that doesn't happen too often.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's something that I'm really, really excited about. Also, parking is always an issue. So the fact that it's going to bring over 800, almost 900 stores with this project, I think is also very important because parking continues to be an issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's really amazing to be able to support projects like this. And, you know, especially when we all work together to make something really good, come forward. So thank you very much. Very supportive of this project.'",

Vice Mayor I just wanted to say I'm just really impressed by this project and at the Downtown Resident, I just think this has so much potential to transform that Mid-Block Civic Center even further. And I also think the project will meet our a lot of our housing goals as well as add more retail and commercial'",

I think he's done a lot of great projects and particularly this one has a lot of community benefits that we've all that they've agreed to provide, including workforce housing for educators and promoting public transit, building community space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also which is really important to that area, is just enhanced me enhancing security around the area. So I'm just very supportive of this project as well as any middle income housing programs. I know they're new, but I do think that there'll be a good fit, that it increases the affordable housing units from 10% to 100% middle'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I yes. Yesterday, Vice Mayor Richardson, I had already seconded it. I think the mayor mentioned that before. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't hear that. Okay. You can go speak emotionally. I'm sorry. I just know it was Councilwoman Allen's district and transferred to. And they is one to respect that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I totally want to respect that. I totally want to respect it, too. But since you don't have the Q system, I did try to text Councilwoman Allen to let her know that I had cued up. So I was just trying to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not an issue of respect. It's just I didn't want to get lost in the queue. So I'm know after you, if you'd like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can go now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. So thank you very much to the staff for the presentation. I really appreciate it. You know, I'm mindful that these particular projects that we're doing with this kind of financing come with some risks. And I just want to hear from city staff a little bit more about the risk and have you really articulate for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'us what those are before we embark on this partnership.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Will have us, Rosie, try to answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember. So, as was indicated in the PowerPoint presentation, there are some risk. It is a complicated, uh, financial structure. There is not much history on the long term viability of these structures. But the way this deal is structured, it's first of all, it's consistent with the policy document that was brought to you at the previous'",
        "'speaker_4': 'meeting and what they've done in order for as an example, to reduce the risk of the foregone property taxes, they are providing a host fee that will make the city whole for its property tax revenues, number one. Number two, the bonds, as an example, will be amortized at the end of the life of the program, meaning that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the the principal and interest will be paid off that way when it does come to selling the property, if that's what the city elects to do. You are capturing or reducing the the large level of debt that that that hopefully at the sale of the property you'll be able to capture and use elsewhere, including but not limited'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to the extension of the buildings into middle income housing units. Also as as was discussed here, the the the property the buildings will will have the affordability requirements and covenants to provide for some meaningful middle income reductions or inclusions, including rental qualified units, which is something that is, I think, meaningful for the program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we staff believe that with these efforts, including reporting requirements and other factors, a requirement to have reserves, in other words, savings accounts, to be able to take on any maintenance requirements for the life of the bonds with the appropriate escalators.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We feel that these provisions not only allow us to move forward and reduce the risk, but also provide, again, meaningful middle income units for the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I appreciate that. And in terms of meeting for middle income, how many middle income units have we built in recent history in the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember prior to the Ocean Air Project, we, I believe, had built somewhere in the neighborhood of 39 units, and that's under the old cycle housing element cycle, which was, I believe, 3% of our requirements. With this next cycle that you were familiar with, we are required to provide over 4100 middle income units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's not an issue for debate. It's a state requirement. It's not whether or not we believe in middle income in the in the the funding or the income requirements or for the the households. It is something that the state has indicated that they that we, the city of Long Beach, need to provide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so of the 580 or so. Correct me if I'm wrong, but of those units, will they all qualify as middle income?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Potentially, yes. All not only just 120, but there's a bill that was approved that will allow us to be able to consider the extended units as middle income units. We do have the measures, the monetary measures, the restrictions that we could potentially deploy for arena eligibility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we need to look into that further.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would this type of financing structure impact the city's current credit rating in any negative way?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to defer with others. But but at this point, my you know, you know what? I'm just going to defer to either Kevin or our or our consultants that are online and available to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This financing structure to the California Community Housing Agency will have no impact on the city of Long Beach's credit rating.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. Did you say we'll have no impact?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No impact, zero impact? We're not responsible for the debt or the debt service, the principal or the interest. It's all on the JPA, the joint powers, the third.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, I got it. And then one final question, actually, to the skilled and trained workforce that we've been talking about. That's not part of the play, but that's an agreement that the developers agreed to correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. That is an agreement between bind between the developer and the and the the in the plan the labor unions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it. Yeah. So similar to what we did at Second and PCH. I think in terms of this with this project, this financing structure, I know it's dependent on a number of variables like property values. What happens if this project were to fail?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is the risk that the city is taking?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is no risk to the city. Again, the owners of the property will be the Joint Powers Authority. They are the owners. They're responsible. They carry on the liability for the payment of the bonds, the repayment of the bonds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So it's a JPA read. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman, your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much for the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'll just add my, my my comments here. Good job to the development team to staff to for getting this project off the ground. I know there were some significant delays. We weren't originally planning to have affordable housing component on the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Originally with the market rate, housing and a hotel was the concept. I know with inclusionary housing this would have required the 11% or whatever it is. And so I'm glad to see that we're using this new tool to ensure that there's significant significantly more units that are available at an affordable rate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Middle Income Housing Program. I'm also glad that we conducted the pilot program first and learned a lot from that and has put a policy on board over the past few weeks to make sure that we've thought through all of these questions that council is asking around risk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm certainly happy to see that the city is being made whole on property taxes, that there's no no loss to the city in that regard. If anything, we're going to see see some increases in terms of overall growth for the area, because it's been significantly depressed in the years since the city hall has been being closed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we'll see some economic progress there. You know, this does help us with Rina. We still have a lot to do with other tiers of affordability. So we have to build more housing at different income levels. That's the way the arena works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm glad to see that we are taking a step forward here, but there's still significantly more to do. And, you know, I'm certainly glad to see, you know, construction and pave the way for for jobs. And, you know, I'm glad to see that we have so many people interested and invested in this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think, you know, that was something really important to the council when we approved the Civic Center project was ensure that there was a project, local project, labor agreement with local hire since it didn't automatically fall into the city's project labor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was something intentionally that we called out. The last thing I'll say is it's a question. Originally, when we designed this, there was a lot of connectivity between City Hall and Lincoln Park and the library. What have we done in the new design to ensure that we still have that connectivity through that walkway and that we have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we still have some level of engagement or retail on the ground floor. Can we speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Councilmember. And we can if others can weigh in on it, that's great. But we do have the Meet the Paseo still included in the design that will allow for folks to connect not only within the Civic Center complex, but also to our downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in the in the Mid-Block project, we will have opportunities for restaurant space, commercial space, and my personal preference is a grocery store within walking distance. So these items will still be included in this entitled project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's great to hear. Certainly happy to hear that. I think the grocery store would be fantastic. I always hear that about lack of grocery in downtown, so that would be huge available in that. Thanks a lot. I see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Christopher Coombs, your hand is up. Councilman, just on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The design that we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Follow up tomorrow with your office. But for those of you, when you're at city hall and you look down that sort of broad open spectrum open courtyard, that courtyard will continue through the Mid-Block project. And then there's a few corridor through Lincoln Park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you'll actually see all the way over into the light rail and sort of the greater downtown area. And that's meant to provide just visual transparency. So there you see the exciting, you know, the grocery store, the park, the places you want to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it's also meant to provide symbolic transparency because the city hall and the park complex are open to the public. And we're visually demonstrating that through the landscape architecture that tie all these different projects together. So we have some great exhibits that we can share with you, and I can follow up with your office tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's great. And I know we talked about actually doing some monuments and some other, like, landmarking here. And, you know, from the park to the city halls. Any words, any of that preserved? There's a history walk, local history walk with art produced by local artists.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not quite ready.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To show you. So we're polishing that up. And it's if you give us another 30 days, I think myself and Public Works would be glad to share that with you, Councilman. Absolutely. That was one of the things like all the neighbors across the city wanted to see some part of their local community pride in our civic center'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And that's the way we want. We represented the compliment Cubano. Thank you. I just want to take a moment to thank staff for the presentation and in particular for answering some very complex and detailed questions from the fourth District.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to mention Christopher Coons is answering those questions right up to the council meeting and during the council meeting. So thank you for that, because the questions are so detailed inside baseball, if you will. I didn't want to read all of them, but I just wanted to mention one which I thought was very pertinent, and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that is if your staff can address this. So saying something should happen to the property in 15 years, what would happen to that covenant of of non-market rate housing? My understanding that it stays with the project for 55 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you comment on that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council Member That is correct. The the units are restricted for 55 years. So if the project is sold at the 15 year or later mark, those units will be retained for qualified.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Middle income units. Okay. Thank you for that. And just what the answer to all the questions. It's very apparent to me that staff has done all their due diligence and so I'll be supporting the project. Thank you.

We have made a lot of progress with uplifting this work since the initiative was initially approved.'",

But to keep our conversation brief this evening, tonight we're going to cover we're going to walk through our implementation of the initiative, including the staffing infrastructure in some of the most prominent updates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to walk through the reconciliation investments, share about some of the promising practices and challenges identified throughout the first year. And we'll take a look ahead at our two year priorities. In our initial presentation, we delve deep into how we got to this point as a city, as our city leadership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You all declared racism as a public health crisis and then put in a call to action for the city team to prepare the framework for reconciliation, to put Long Beach in a position to address systemic racism. Ultimately, our vision is that race and ethnicity do not determine social and economic outcomes for those who live and work in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long Beach. This framework continues to serve to support the way we move this work forward and hold us accountable not only to ourselves, but to the community at large. We continue to acknowledge, listen, convene and catalyze in multiple spaces as we proceed with this critical work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a quick reminder, Council adopted the Racial Equity and Reconciliation Initiative initial report on August 11th, 2020. Each of the four goals have anywhere from 3 to 8 strategies. Upon council direction, we walked away with nearly 120 potential actions to support all of these strategies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tonight's presentation highlights key updates within each goal and provides information on some of the actions underway. The next few slides will explain how the Office of Equity organizes staff to add capacity to our small but mighty team. I will also describe some of the tools we've developed to support city staff in understanding and operationalizing equity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You all have seen our implementation structure in previous presentations. Today we would like to highlight some of the changes to this infrastructure. First, we rebranded the Racial Equity Advisory Group to the Racial Equity Executive Team. We wanted to we wanted the name to be reflective of our intentions for convening department heads.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The executive team plays an active role in learning and implementing equity frameworks within their department. Additionally, workforce equity has emerged as a policy workgroup priority. Members will explore the feasibility of making recommendations to the city's personnel, policies and procedures with support from the Civil Service and human resources departments and the City Attorney's Office.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lastly, rather than convening a large workgroup for Communications, Office of Equity Staff is working closely with the public affairs team to develop tools and strategies for equitable communications. We would like to provide a few in-depth updates on some of our work groups.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To achieve a future where race does not determine social and economic outcomes. Accurate and specific data collection is critical to our decision making. The Data and Performance Metrics Work Group began by creating an implementation strategy to address the proposed actions within the initial report, such as creating racial equity centered benchmarks for our results based accountability process and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'developing equity profile snapshots that allow users to compare citywide population level indicators across council districts. Over the last year, workgroup members supported the Technology and Innovation Department and Commission in researching best practices around the governance of facial recognition technology.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Finally, workgroup members helped develop the Equitable Data Collection Toolkit, which works in tandem with the city's Communications Plan for Equity Toolkit, Data Privacy Guidelines and Digital Engagement Toolkit. Following the Government Alliance for Race Equity Theory of Change. We first began with normalizing conversations about race within the city organization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do this to establish shared language and grounding for our work. The Internal Transformation Workgroup consists of 1 to 2 champions from every citywide department. Champions facilitate racial equity one on one trainings and are actively involved in the Results based Accountability Training Series.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a total of 41 champions and over the last year they completed 32 hours of capacity building workshops. They've also trained nearly 1000 city employees, and currently six departments have fully trained their entire staff. The word cloud on the slide comes from the Champions Responses to our Year two survey.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When asked what three words they would use to describe being a champion, challenging, emotional and important were among the top. These words underscore how impactful but how hard this work is. The Framework for reconciliation began in response to an act of police violence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Consequently, community stakeholders pushed for the city to explore the creation of non-police civilian response teams. The Alternative Crisis Response Work Group became our first special project as this objective garnered support from City Council with funding to pilot an alternate response program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The workgroup is developing recommendations for a non-police civilian crisis response team to respond to nonviolent, non-medical, non-criminal calls for service related to mental health crises, with technical assistance from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Performance Lab. The workgroup plans to conduct stakeholder engagement with community members and service providers later this month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we are hopeful to have a pilot model up and running by the end of the summer. Next, we're going to walk you through some of the specific updates and accomplishments that fall under each of the goals. I'm sure you noticed that the one year update is just as long as the initial report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's because there are so many actions to address. Our update focuses on implementing the immediate and short term potential actions outlined in the initial report, as these items were estimated to require less than six months and between six months and a year for implementation respectively.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the report, the updates are formatted in a table just as you see on the slide. Updates were gathered from department leadership, racial equity champions and other staff between July and December of 2021. Each potential action identifies the city department and or workgroup assigned to the item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a status indicating whether the action item is completed in progress or not started. Over the last year, the implementation team and corresponding city departments began implementing 93 immediate and short term potential actions and have completed 12 of the recommendations uplifted in the initial report by aligning existing resources, programs and staff.'",

And it is our role and responsibility to proactively dismantle the systemic racism. To date, we have made the most progress and goal one because we had to start internally in order to create a foundation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to effectively uplift the actions outlined in goals two, three and four. We've already talked about many of the accomplishments that are listed on the slide, but we want to take a moment to highlight one more as well as some of the work that's in progress.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Earlier earlier this year, the Council directed the city manager to work with the Human Relations Commission to update and expand its mission and scope to align with the recommendations from the initial report. The Equity in Human Relations Commission's name, purpose functions and membership were modified with stakeholders input and approved by the City Council last fall.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Financial management is working to transform the city's procurement processes to remove barriers for black and other historically marginalized business communities by streamlining processes and policies, developing resources for internal and external stakeholders, and improving outreach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mechanisms to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Racial equity. 1 to 1 is a staff led training that provides a foundational understanding of racial equity. Though adapted from care, this training uses local data to contextualize the inequities in Long Beach, and it explains the historic role of government in creating and maintaining inequities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The training also introduces the equity lens, which staff can apply to various elements of their work. Additionally, the Office of Equity is utilized utilizing anti-racist results based accountability, also known as RBI, to develop and operationalize racial equity action plans for the 21 citywide departments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These strategies will be specific and measurable guaranteeing guaranteeing that we can monitor and evaluate our impact in the years to come. Allen is going to walk you through the steps of RBA framework later in this presentation. The acts, the actions outlined and goal to provide an opportunity to systemically look at the local and economic barriers which perpetuate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'violence in communities and begin to address them. We are focused on moving upstream in order to address the root causes of violence and continue to expand on community safety efforts from a holistic place that includes a spectrum of city departments and cross-sector collaboration efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This goal also focuses on building a coordinated reentry network, as well as a structural city investment in best practice and what works for community based violence prevention and reentry. The Health Department is in the process of filling positions related to community safety and youth development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The youth and Emerging Adult Strategic Plan, as you know, was adopted by council last February. $50,000 of reconciliation funding was allocated for the Long Beach Advancing Peace Steering Committee in four place based areas across the city, and 100,000 to contract with the nonprofit partnership to provide technical support to startup and small community based organizations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Libra funding will be allocated to expand the violence interrupter model from central Long Beach into North Long Beach. Staff concluded a landscape analysis of the Reentry Service Network in Long Beach and drafted a report with recommendations to pilot a reentry integrated model.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the police department is working with human resources, civil service, civil service and labor organizations to develop the roles and responsibilities of the community services assistance which will be unarmed civilians trained. Trained to respond to nonviolent crimes. Goal three comes directly from the Long Beach community, calling for reimagining of police practices and assurances that none would disproportionately'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and negatively impact the black community and communities of color. And so it takes a deeper dove into redesigning the police approach to community safety. One of these challenges, one of these changes includes the Office of Constitutional Policing, with whom we meet regularly to coordinate implementation of the Racial Equity and Reconciliation Initiative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A few of the accomplishments and activities to highlight include the REACH team, which serves as an alternative response model focused on increasing access to services for people experiencing homelessness. In addition, the city is seeking to establish an alternate response model for nonviolent calls for service related to mental health needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We previously mentioned this program during the workgroup updates. The police department is also developing a course catalog of trainings and professional development for officers to include topics related to procedural justice and racial equity. And lastly, the Technology and Innovation Commission has led discussions on regulatory approaches for the city's use of facial recognition technology.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our fourth and broadest goal is to improve health and wellness in the city by eliminating social and economic disparities and the communities most impacted by racism. We know that if we want to improve health and safety for all, we must look at the root of what creates opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Things like economic justice, early child and youth development, housing, environmental justice and more. Accomplishments and work in progress include structural funding added to the Health Department budget, which we will share on the next slide. The Parks, Recreation and Marine Strategic Plan, which acknowledges that Park Equity is directly linked to life outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hiring two full time positions to lead the Office of Youth Development and alignment with the Youth Strategic Plan. Allocating recovery funding to invest in health equity and economic equity. And $6.3 million to increase youth development through the Long Beach Youth Climate Corps program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'During the fiscal year 2021 budget process in alignment with the framework for reconciliation. More than 3 million in one time and structural funding was allocated to support communities most impacted by inequities. 1.5 million came from the funding sources such as Major Measure US Cares Act and the Recovery Act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 1.5 million you see on the screen is the structural funding that was allocated to support implementation of the initiative. The largest allocation was invested in the health department to increase the capacity to support some, but not all the actions outlined in the report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Throughout the year, community grants and contracts have supported black mental and physical health providers planning with Latinx community stakeholders through the movie La Quinta Initiative, vaccine outreach, support for reentry, youth social capital programs, early childhood education through the library's summer community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Engagement in parks and training and capacity building. In addition to the goal area updates, we wanted to uplift the Long Beach Recovery Act, which provides one time funding to support many of the objectives from the initial report, such as food security programing, digital inclusion, early childhood education, business support and housing, just to name a few.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Reconciliation and our Equity Toolkit have equipped city staff to lead a smart and inclusive recovery over the past 18 months. This includes equitable access to COVID testing, vaccinations and the administration of the CARES Act and LIBRE funds. We are centering community in our program, development and implementation as we reflect on our first year of implementation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We believe it is important to uplift many of the promising practices and challenges we've encountered thus far on our journey. In naming them, we lean into the equity team's core values of humility and transparency, and we use these lessons learned to inform our priorities and next steps as we move the work ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Last year, the Department of Financial Management Management recruited employees to join a core team known as the FM equity advocates. The team's primary role is to build an inclusive culture to integrate the reconciliation potential. Actions across the bureau's financial management is one of five departments to organize an internal equity team in year one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other departments that demonstrated this is as a promising practice include economic development, the Harbor Department's Equity, Equity and Inclusion Champions, Library Services, Racial Equity Committee and the Water Department Equity Coalition. The Library Services Audit is a strong, strong example of applying an equity lens to our work as it as it engages diverse communities and centered the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'recommendations on the community's distinctive needs to improve equitable access to library services and programs. Another promising practice we like to uplift is the Harbor Department's hiring of AI of AI diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging consultant. The Port's consultant, partner and with department leadership and Key Project leads to provide facilitation, support and help shape internal actions regarding the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'initial report. We uplift this work as a promising practice because the port is the first department to hire an external consultant to support their equity efforts. The first. The first challenge we name concerns, leadership support and the prioritization of racial equity as each department implements the initiative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have observed champions and department heads navigating unique organizational cultures, varying capacities, resources and priorities, all of which can affect implementation. That said, it is important to note that this work starts with buy in and engagement at the top.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've done a great job of building capacity through our racial equity champions and we are therefore prioritizing capacity building and engagement at the director level. Likewise, we look forward to continuing our counsel briefings to keep you all engaged on the initiative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'During the past year, champions have struggled to balance the time needed for racial equity tasks with their assigned duties, causing many to experience burnout and feel unsupported. Ideally, we would like to reach a point where equity is fully baked into the city's day to day service and culture.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So to further integrate equity into each department. Champions are recruiting members of other bureaus to serve as part of their internal equity committee. Committees will provide additional capacity in the work to come. The initial report focuses on improving outcomes for black, indigenous and people of color.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And other underresourced communities through the equitable delivery of services, programs and resources to address the community facing strategies. We have spent a significant amount of time on staff training and education. Looking ahead, we plan to balance our focus on internal infrastructure with external strategies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this will be done through stronger communications and community engagement. From the inception of our country, government at every level has played a role in creating and maintaining racial inequity. Too often, racial equality, racial equity efforts focus on the symptoms of inequity acting as more more as bandages that do not address the underlying root causes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Therefore, our results based accountability methodology will help us develop race explicit strategies to achieve equity for black communities and communities of color, which in turn benefit all of us across the city. Leaving Council tonight. Our champions will continue to develop departmental racial equity action plans using RBA or results based accountability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To quickly walk you through this process. We begin at the top of the inverted triangle. Looking at the results. All people in Long Beach are healthy, safe and thriving. Next, we use population level indicators low income, extreme rent burden and life expectancy to help us measure whether we are meeting this vision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Champions are currently at the root cause analysis step where they repeatedly ask, why is there a gap for black people and people of color? And what city policies and practices are preserving this disproportionality? From this analysis, we identify the hot roots or the things that the city can seek to change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those hot roots inform the strategies or performance indicators each department will prioritize within their racial equity action plan. With those strategies, we will build in accountability measures to evaluate our impact and to adjust as necessary. So this slide summarizes all of the priorities we've discussed this evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Deeper engagement of city leadership and community. Stronger communications. Finalizing our racial equity action plans. And seeking resources to further support this work. So as you can see, the 136 page update that we provided all of you, there's really a lot of work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We had to use a lot of pages because there's a lot of work being done and there's so much more to come. We're grateful for the ongoing support from our council and our mayor and our city team and our community members, and we look forward to moving forward with this work in all the years to come.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we thank you for your time this evening, and we are available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. That concludes staff's report. And just we're really proud of the work that they're doing. Teresa and Lot get to present this tonight. But there's a whole group of our champions, of our department directors, of our managers who are really engaged in this work every single day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're very proud of what they do and we'll continue to support them and move this forward. So we're available for answering questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Thank you very much. That was a great report. Big you very much for that. I want to go ahead and. I have the cute back here. Councilman Murray Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank staff for a very thorough report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a lot of good work done there in regards to a real big challenge that we have not only here in Long Beach, California, and in the country and all whole that as well. Very good aspects of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question regarding to the champions. It seems like the report really relies a lot on the reporting that these champions go through in terms of getting the data and the information necessary. They went through some training.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is how are these champions chosen? How are they trained? And do they get any kind of compensation or reimbursement or some other kind of benefit for. Are they volunteers for volunteering to be a champion or is it something that is done through another methodology?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That's a good question. We're going to tag team on tab, tag team on our responses this evening. So our champions, we do have one to do champions. The first initial commitment of the champions was six months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of the champions have rolled into full gear, but we have had some turnover. Champions were referred through a leadership team that was already established from department directors, from managers across the city, and people that just showed interest in the work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we do have a bit of a formal process for bringing people in and they receive some training and support from the equity office directly. We were able to they this work has also worked into their regular work day because all the directors are embracing this work and so the departments, you know, it's baked in are baking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it in to the champions work life balance. Of course we still have opportunities to grow in that space, but we're a work in progress. We also were able to provide the champions with bonuses this year for that work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And our our hope is that we can continue to do so moving forward. So I'll turn it over to Alina. Yeah. Just to quickly add, some of the champions were identified as members who previously participated in the GARE cohorts that the city also conducts as part of the A national network.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So are these bonuses going to continue throughout the process or is there going to be a soak in the termination date? Is there a process to either turn them over or is there just be an opportunity for these individuals to serve as champions for as long as they want?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or they can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember. So those bonuses were identified through a one time funding source. Ideally, we would definitely love to look at ways to structurally fund and support our equity work across the entire city. So that's definitely something we we we hope to have your support with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regarding the continuity of champions. We definitely do not turn anybody away who wants to engage in this work. Equity is a responsibility for all of us. That said, the champions who have opted to stay on are continuing to support and serve as champions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But by creating these racial equity committees for each department, we are bringing more people into the work so that we can better disseminate equity and the responsibility of this work across the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I'm glad to see that all departments are being engaged in this process, and that's where we start to get a change of culture in order to change the attitudes. So thank you very much for your report. Thank you, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that Vice Mayor Richardson, you made the motion at the start. Did you already make your comments on the motion? No, not yet. Okay. So let me just go back to you since you made the motion and then I'll go up and down the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The folks have like you up. Great. Thank you. Well, first, I want to just congratulate the team on a tremendous degree of progress. 105 out of 120 some items progress, 105 of them. That's significant. I know also that you also had a lot of other critically important work to do at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I love to see that how this work includes those significant things like the distribution of pandemic resources, critically, critically important from testing to vaccinations, food security, all of those things we we were confronted with since implement this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I've seen evidence of this work lays throughout all of that work. We also continue a lot of progress on a lot of progress on our land use work up plan that significantly advances equity, that work. That's incredibly important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know we we've taken some significant steps on that, creating some nonviolence response models, the rich themes. Looking forward to seeing that roll out. I also know that our efforts look like mental health support are called out as priorities when it is planned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're finally taking steps to localized mental health here. That's super important. I'm excited for the Office of Youth Development at Toronto's Alacrity Center of Youth Development and run our youth center directly directly called out within the reconciliation plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The youth funding measure us huge, huge advancement. I look forward to seeing that impact the lives of youth and use our organization across the city. That's incredibly important. And you know, the work that we're doing to establish this structure, the structure you set up is great with equity champions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the work within the police department is critically important about building trust with our police department and embracing community policing. That's absolutely critical. I love the new capacity infrastructure in place. Long Beach Center for Economic Inclusion, the Black Health Equity Collaborative, the new Data Center of Media Report with the Latino Health Equity Initiative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of them have been incredibly active, super active throughout this year with health, health fairs and getting resources out communities. That's great. I also just generally want to comment that, you know, these are this is not easy work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's important, but it's not easy if it's a shift in culture. Like, quite frankly, to be frank to say, it's a shift in the service of your city, a commitment to shaping a city where every neighborhood is healthy, safe and driving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's great. Where every neighborhood, no matter zip code, you know, have an opportunity to provide. We know that hasn't been the case. But that's a commitment. That's a commitment that the path forward will require acknowledgment of deep inequities, not being afraid of using it, talking about race, looking at data, the those issues that have plagued our communities'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for a long time, from poverty to deep inequities on health and economic inequity. Those are outcomes of largely human based decisions land use decisions, environmental decisions that we made, things like red line and yellow line and where freeways are built.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're dealing with that result today. So I pointed to residents. Do you kind of sum up with this equity works with be about? For me, I use the analogy of a garden. If you have a garden, that garden in order to bear fruit is going to need some level of nourishing and nurturing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if that garden is starved of water, you know, lack of care, it takes all the bad and characteristic risks in our communities that might be crime, may be poverty. Some of these characteristics. But you can't simply just turn on the spigot and expect with regard to the balance right back, you got to reinvest in the very'",
        "'speaker_0': 'soul. You have to restore the garden in order for it to bear fruit. It will take care. It's going to take some more planning and to take resources. It's going to take leadership. Those are the types of things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's really true equity in the city. So to me, it's about building a modern and resilient city. Doesn't happen overnight. Neither did the transition away from harassment, the culture of harassment, the workplace, and two years of training. It's years of capacity building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so to. But, you know, I would say a city has a robust infrastructure around harassment. Culture is probably a stronger, more resilient city. I say the same thing about creating an anti-racist, inclusive city, which is the city that Long Beach strives to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, you know, I want to thank all the staff for all the work you've done. I know that you called out things that still needed to be done. It's important to do that. It needs to be mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's certainly more to do. And I want to thank the 41 equity champions across the city and the new Equity and Human Relations Commission, all of you, for doing a great job. There's significant movement, significantly more focus, but continue to chart.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is culture shift in our city. I think our city be better off for it. Thanks. Thank you very much, Mayor. Let me go through the impressive list I have. Councilmember something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. Yes. I want to add to my thanks to the team that Chandler and Grant for the comprehensive presentation to making sure that, you know, you kind of come through the report, making sure you report back on all the goals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I also want to make sure to thank Katy Balderas, who had recently left for her hard work and, you know, going through the listening sessions as well as getting to this, helping to get at this report as well and thank the equity champions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's I think it's a lot of work. It's a lot of great work to be able to kind of be that person to make sure that you're being conscious about. How do you bring the conversation about race and equity to the forefront and to be that representative for your department and the city?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I want to make sure to just acknowledge how how far we came. Right. So much has happened and so many difficult conversations had occurred. And there was a lot of pain, a lot of pain involved in this discussion and creating this framework.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just really want to make sure that that that we're moving in. And I see this report back as a healing process and a process that we're taking toward a solution that we're not stuck on, you know, the problems and that we're able to really kind of move together collectively and how we think about working towards'",
        "'speaker_1': 'solution. And that is really where it's about collecting data, about really being able to see what's happening on the ground. When we talk about inequity into numbers, right? We're talking about numbers we're collecting around poverty numbers to unemployment numbers and breaking them down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, I like seeing race because then we'll see a clearer picture when we're able to really dig in what those roots problem are. We want to be able to then think about those solutions. And I know that this report back was demonstrating some steps towards that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I really appreciated and really look forward to continuing on that journey because I it gives me hope as a representative of the sixth District that has one of the higher rates of people living in poverty and violence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. It gives me hope that and it lifts up my heart to know that we're able to work towards the solution, to be able to address it collectively together and to give people hope in the district, too, that we're not sitting down and, you know, we're thinking about it all the time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Staff is thinking about it. So we're always thinking about how can we do better at the city? And that's what I want people to leave with when they think about this equity, this framework for equity, equity and of the solutions that we're working towards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the end of the day, how do we make sure that we're overall making our city a better place to live, work and recreate? Right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City Council member. I have come a supermarket. Thank you. I'd just like to thank staff for a great presentation. Theresa Chandler, your usual stellar job. Thank you. And I also want to mention Alana Grant and say congratulations on your promotion to equity officer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think is this your first presentation of council as the new equity officer? And you did an incredible job. Thank you. You have council member Irena. Oh, sorry, Mayor. I did not bring down my hand. Okay, great. I just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank staff for the for the report. I know how many of us are receiving briefings and updates on the progress, and I agree with a lot of what has been said. I do have just a thought.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Murdoch, I thought it would be good. I know we have a presentation coming to the council about the P.C.C. Our reforms and our conversation has happened and public safety committee and community forums. That's been a big part, I think, of this report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I know that it's in the report as one of the recommendations, but I think there's been a lot of conversation about what the next steps are. So I know this is coming in front of a council, I believe, for some recommendations for some of the outreach that's happened.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, community meetings. Can you provide the Council a framework of the kind of C.P.S. process and how it relates to the reform framework?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So you raise a really good point. The report's over 130 pages long, and tonight we did a 15 minute presentation of kind of themes and certain items. We did not get into every single item. And then, you know, a lot of that is in the report itself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to make sure we do remember that in December we talked a lot about the police specific reforms. And so we really focused on a heavier presentation on those in December. And then in February we're going to be coming back February 15th on the PCC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that recommendation was it's gone through an outside consultant. We brought on some experts to really do a lot of listening and then come up with some different ideas and concepts. They did some initial revealing of their recommendations, kind of the framework back in December and did some community meetings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They'll have their final report done fairly soon, and that'll be on your agenda. We're shooting for February 15th to talk both about what can be done under the current structure and then what are the options for a ballot measure, which is one of the items in the reconciliation report and and get that to council so we can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'start on the meeting confer and if we want to go towards a ballot measure getting ready for November 20, 22.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I know that a lot of folks on the council's computer are looking forward to that, the presentation. I think everyone's been working on that. I know it's a big initiative happening at the city. I do want to also just take a second to think not just all the champions and the equity champions, but also the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Office of Equity. I know that we've had some changes as well, but just to the to our former team and the new team that's transition and just really great work. And I just want to thank them individually for just continuing to think about equity across all of our city departments and and really to serve as models for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the rest of the country and that they're also doing and engaging in this work. So a huge thank you to them and to everyone and all of our city departments that are doing this work. Councilwoman, did they?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Marry me. I thought I had already queued up, as they say, headed. I just want to say thank you so much to staff, to Alana, to three staff for all the incredible work that they've done on this, the equity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's it's been it's been a tough road. I know that that because I remember where we were when we first began. And it was so difficult and so really, really intense and very heavy on all of our hearts that I, I agree with with council members sorrow that we must move forward and we must really focus on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what we're doing from here on and correct things and really emphasize on making a positive, positive impact for our community to be able to grow from there and thrive. So I'm really excited about that. I also loved everything in the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that that's great. I'm really excited to have you back with that as part of the, um, initiative on, on this. Awesome. And I think that, um, one of the things that, that is very, very important is our, our equity champions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, I can't thank them enough for their role. I think that they've done some amazing work and really, really hard to really get deep down into it. And I think that, you know, I think that they're very, very important of the success of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so hopefully we can find some structured funding to be able to provide for them and be able to to show them how much we we value them as we move forward. And so because this is a very, very complex but very necessary step to take.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to to all the champions. And thank you. Thank you very much and to the staff for doing a fantastic job. Alana, like the council members for now said, you know, they did great on their first official big presentation on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Congratulations. And we cannot forget about Katie and all the work that she put into this, too. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Councilmember. I do have some people cued up. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you to Teresa and Alana for your presentation tonight and also for providing us a briefing along the way. I really, really appreciate that council offices are being brought to the table regarding city wide initiatives so that we can all weigh in on on the things that are important to all of us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'beyond just the greater efforts. I love that you called out specifically the library efforts that we've made in response to the city auditor's audit. I know that Councilman Ranga and I have both been really involved in that, and I think it's great that you guys called it out here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that was very important. And I'm hopeful that as we move forward with next year's budget, the city manager is able to prioritize some of the items that we requested on our agenda item that we brought to council that resulted in a finding that those additional items were going to be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Significant of significant cost to the city. But still, they're very important for the future of our library system. I think we really have to start thinking about the way that we utilize our library system and the importance of access and what we can do to try to incentivize and encourage residents to continue to use our library system'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So I appreciate you guys covering that specifically. I think that's really important. And I know that the city manager mentioned the the work of the police department that was highlighted in their own presentation on this topic. But I do know that when Councilman Superman and Councilman Austin and I were on the Public Safety Committee along the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'time that we were working on some of these policies and initiatives, we talked at length about some opportunities for adoption of best practices by the police department. And the police department has been completely 100% supportive of taking on additional best practices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just want to point out, I know that the police department never mentioned it before, but I want to highlight again and that the participation in Georgetown Law School's able program is a huge thing for our city police department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that they are working to make sure they have the funding to do that and have interviewed for that. But as someone who is in the criminal justice reform space every day, that program is getting a lot of accolades in terms of top down management training that changes culture and helps integrate best practices into our police'",
        "'speaker_1': 'departments, especially when we're talking about bystander liability, bystander responsibility. And that's just been a huge, huge, a lot of progress made in that program. So I'm glad that our police department will be participating in that. And I just want to thank you guys for the report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I look forward to the February 15th meeting where we talk about changes to the PCC. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Durango. Something has came to mind in regards to the police department and how you brought that up was the fact that there was a constitutional committee or something about it in the police department. Are we going to be getting an update on that eventually?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. So the Office of Constitutional Policing is. It's on its way. So they are actually bringing on more staff to the team. I think they are taking on more just more initiatives. We work very closely with the Office of Constitutional Policing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are great partners with us, and especially focusing on our goal three of the initiative that we are walking hand-in-hand through these concepts together and initiatives or items. We also have the Office of Constitutional Policing Online. If you have more questions, but if you wanted a specific update from them, I'm sure we could talk to them about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'providing one later on. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that was my only request would be that maybe we could get a report later on down the line. And in terms of the work they're doing and what are the expectations? They? Thank you. I have Count Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just just two things. One, um, I'm kind of embarrassed. I didn't congratulate a lot of great on her first first presentation. Congratulations, Lana. I think you did an incredible job on the presentation. Secondly, you know, I think, you know, thinking back to the presentation, I think to years, two weeks ago on homelessness, when I talked about'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the population of our chronic homeless in 44, 46% black, I think at one point it was a cultural when women talk about race. I think it's important particularly with justified is work with the public by using data points like that is important to have a culturally appropriate response when we take on issues that everyone cares about, there's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'great agreement on the issue of homelessness. I think some would say, you know, that the way that we address it, given the significant over representation of the black community, is the lead in with folks like the newly established Black Health Equity Collaborative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to make sure that there are community groups that, you know, have a similar shared background help, do a lot of engagement in the work, and that you also acknowledge that, you know, there's, you know, alignment between the homelessness and the poverty work that we're talking about and that we're doing here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just wanted to give that up between last presentation. This presentation and given today is Black History Month. It's important that we acknowledge these things so that we can do a better job in the future and address them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks a lot. Thank you. Councilmember Austin. Well, thank you. And also, I just salute our staff for their presentation, which unfortunately I had to miss. I had to step away. But I read most of your your staff report, and I wanted to just say the accountability after one year in the progress is something that we should salute'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and and celebrate. We are making great progress here in the city of Long Beach, in the areas of racial equity and inclusion with our our. A reconciliation initiative and much of the work that has gone into it. And I think that that is a credit to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So obviously our city management team working with Teresa and Helena Grant, having a dedicated staff who truly believe and are passionate about this work. I think that is there's evidence in the presentation, but also of the staff report and the work that is actually continuing here in our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, obviously, a big piece of that work was also of, you know, policing and changing policing of the mission or guarding the office of Constitutional Policing. Councilmember Price also mentioned, you know, many of the the the reforms that have kind of gone in place as a result of council direction, but also listening to our community as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'well. I'm looking forward to the PCC presentation, obviously a former chair, that commission, somebody who served on the commission. I'm looking forward to us to the recommendations and actually going fully vetting those recommendations from a consultant who has been working with our community for some time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also, I just want to point out the fact that we also, as a city council, have made some bold moves to talk of accountability and transparency in policing and saying that, you know what, we want to we want to be a leader.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, you know, the move that we made to join me and partner with the Louis Registry at USC, I think should also be noted here as we as a city have demonstrated great commitment to to the issues that have been communicated to our council by our residents, but also, you know, just understanding where we are in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'terms of, you know, the policies that need to be moving forward. So with that, I just wanted to just my voice and congratulations and appreciation to our team for their great work and understand that they will continue to do this and they have my full support moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Make a council member. Do we have public comment?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. At this time, if there's any members of the public that wish to speak on this item, please press star nine or use the raise hand function. Our first speaker is and I can pay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. Please go. Hello? You hear me?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. City staff. Excellent report. I read all 136 pages. Although, to be fair, it really is about 120 pages. And then you guys kind of overlap too with the equity talk, but I know that's just city staff trying to make sure our pilots are engaged.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council is keeping up with these reports. That being said, I think what the Office of Equity in the city manager's office has been able to do with this document is essentially provide an infrastructure plan for the future of the city of Long Beach with respect to equity and race relations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's up to the culture. As a council councilmember, Turanga stated, It's up to the culture of the of the city staff and bureaucracy and just as a whole and to the development of a progressive future. Okay, so that was the positive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we've got to get to the meat of the bones of it. I have an issue. I have to be honest, I have issue because I don't really see in this document. I see references to being in other groups, which I love them and everyone, Dr. Andrew Johnson, everyone involved, April Parker and Jackson, everyone involved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That said, I have issues with this report because I don't really see funding in pipelines towards black led organizations and groups. And to be clear, as Ms.. Chandler referenced, the city takes responsibility for its part in systemic racism with respect to life here in America.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, I understand that. But if we're trying to create solutions, we have to create financing structures of opportunity for black led organizations to deliver with respect to our communities. It's not enough that there are carve outs, one time carve outs with respect to things like a food crisis or a food desert I live in.'",
        "'speaker_0': '908131 out of three people in my in my zip code is living under the poverty line and it's over. Even though my ethnicity is an underrepresented group. Now we're overrepresented, I think as a vice mayor, Richardson referenced with regards the homeless report from a week ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So unless there's financial funding in pipelines for black led organizations, this is just something that's going to be perpetual. And I would rather that we as a city and as a community provide black. If I accept as a black community, we don't have capacity, but we need the city structure to help us build capacity so that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'can be the architects of our own future and not be opportunities for charity as it currently. That being said, this infrastructure help but helps us. We just need you as a city to really extend that dollar to towards black led organizations.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Ailsa Chang.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good evening, city council. I actually don't have prepared remarks today, which is kind of a new thing for me, but yeah, I just wanted to. Well, first of all, I'm in District five now, Satterlee District seven. And then secondly, I wanted to formally and through public comment, congratulate Alan Grant on the being the equity officer and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'during this presentation and now so many thanks to Teresa Chandler and the whole Office of Equity Team. There's a lot to digest, unlike the previous speaker, since I did not read all 136 pages. But what I am incredibly, incredibly encouraged about is the city's use of the anti-racist results based accountability framework.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have personally worked with the city's consultant that is called Equity and Results, the team of Theo and Erika. And I'm I love them. I'm super encouraged that the city is is working with that team and using this anti-racist results based accountability framework to go really, really deep into the root causes and therefore solutions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then lastly, I just want to support the comments of the previous speakers and I can say in terms of building pipelines for funding for black led organizations. Thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our final speaker is Dave Shukla.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, thank you. And thanks to Chandler and Ms.. Grant for that wonderful presentation so that you can better assess and make up your own mind about what I have to say. Next couple of. Quick points. I'm a son of the sea.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The I in that statement did not refer to Dave Chappelle. Third point, there are few things more racist in the history of California over the past 140 years than the division of oil, knowledge and oil moneys. Fourthly, the passage of this framework, an initiative in August of 2020, was not without its own inequity.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Now I've written notes, comments on the report and translation. I can email, but with what little time I have left, I'd like to briefly explain some of my comments back in August of 2020. Basically, without getting too deep into sort of details and all that, I was being asked to betray myself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's not what I'm about. I left graduate school to do a thing. And a guy like me, he picks his dates, picks these moments and today's the day. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. That concludes, I think, public comment.'",

I know this was a lot to take in, but as a council member who was not on the diocese during the 2020 process, just the simplistic nature of all of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this just just amazes me. And I'm sure that it hasn't been easy. I saw in the report some issues like burnout that you had to overcome, and it still persists. So I just want to say just thank you for your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Overall, what I see is a rigorous examination and progress, and I know that the progress of ensuring that equity is part of all our decisions is is something that's going to take years of sustained effort. And I just look forward to that periodic update on our progress and any recommendations that you have, both internally for our city'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So, Mr. Mayor, we've done this several times with the council over the last probably two years where we pick a department and we go through and we do a really in-depth analysis of the fee structure of what a service costs and what a fee should be set at and determining the right subsidy level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we do have a presentation for you tonight. We have gone in-depth into public works and energy resources. You're not adopting or approving any fees tonight. Tonight is the ability to get informed on the work, to ask us questions, to raise any concerns you have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we'll come back in April with the actual fee increases and changes. And so I will be turning the presentation over to our finance team to walk through it with the departments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thanks, Tom. This is Grace. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the city council. As Tom mentioned, this is our second round of the city wide field study and has been completed for two departments, public works and energy resources.'",

But again, the purpose of today's presentation is to provide you all with an overview and an opportunity to make comments, and we will come back for formal approval on April 12th.'",

Then we will turn the presentation over to public works and energy resources will each go over the highlights of their department's study findings and their recommended fee changes.'",

The city currently has routine processes in place to ensure that these are reviewed and updated regularly to capture annual cost increases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city implements an annual inflation adjustment based on city cost increases called the City Cost Index. The master fees and charges schedules are adopted each year with the budget with any proposed changes by the departments and CPI updates.'",

And finally, there are fee deletions related to revised fee structures, as well as clean up to fees schedules for services no longer provided by the city.

The commonly requested items that we receive, such as curb painting, have been added and the costs have been spread out over the next three years to avoid a steep increase given the importance of these'",
        "'speaker_0': 'items to the community. And finally want to highlight the traffic control plan review is separate from the planned check the as currently outlined in the current schedule. This recommendation will reflect the true cost of services which are actually higher than the cost of service today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next slide, please. So roughly a quarter of the fees are recommended to be decreased based on processing efficiencies. Since the last study, a quarter are recommended to be removed to align with the current business practices. And you can see a couple examples here on the slide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next slide, please. Another quarter are recommended to increase for full cost recovery. And approximately the last quarter of the fees are new fees or a restructure to existing fees to better align with today's current operations and to continue providing the critical services to the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next slide, please. So in.'",

This matrix illustrates cost recovery intervention rates at current levels across the four service categories by revenue and by percentage of total service costs across all four categories.

So as you can see, the cost of recovery by service categories are not uniform. Next slide, please. All right. Based on the energy resources cost recovery frame, study results.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Staff recommends proceeding with 56 rate changes in order to recoup costs and maintain operational needs. If all of the study recommendations were to be accepted, the estimated theoretical revenue impact is $8,675.

        "'speaker_0': 'However, Energy Resources staff emphasized that this theoretical increase would present a hardship for many of the gas utility customers and ratepayers and support a partial acceptance of these recommended changes.

        "'speaker_0': 'Again, full cost recovery is not being recommended for all fees as some relate to. Utility. Ratepayers and department staff strongly believe that increasing these rates would cause a hardship to our customers during the rebound period from the COVID 19 pandemic and should therefore be delayed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The decision to proceed with changes to 56 fee items is based on infrastructure and operational needs as identified by the study. It is related to new construction, engineering projects, gas meter purchase and installations driven by requests for new services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For example, no contract or developer developers request for new gas services. Next slide, please. The next two slides summarize energy resources staff recommendations by change, which, for example, increase or decrease, no change and so on. So let's look at no change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of the 17 fees recommended not to change, eight in the gas services and utility services were validated as accurate and are currently at cost. Recovery nine Gas services and utility services fees are recommended by staff to hold at current levels for the future, i.e. post-pandemic for review by staff and present.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'm sorry. That's odd. So let's just start going with slide 30 here, if that's okay with you. So for the Fiji decrees, three fees in the engineering and construction services are recommended to decrease to better align with cost recovery and operational need.'",
        "'speaker_0': '16 fees and the gas services segment are recommended to increase to better align with cost recovery and operational need and 35 fees across all energy resource services areas are recommended for restructure to better align with the provision of service.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The detailed breakdown of these fees are presented in the attachment. B2 Next slide. The Energy Resources Department's rate structure does not easily compare across utilities in other jurisdictions. A primary reason for jurisdictional uniqueness is due to the specific policy goals and objectives of each city or utilities governing body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's important to note, however, that energy resources does consider consumer utility costs as they relate to the Southern California Gas Company to ensure fair and equitable rates. Specific fees are not compared to so-called gas, as energy resources is a municipality as opposed to an investor owned utility and therefore mandated to follow specific local and state guidelines'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And this concludes our report, and we're happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Tony. So to wrap up this presentation and summary, three key points. The city is generally under-recovery for cost based on the study done for public works and energy resources. E through departments have proposed recommendations that generally align with the study's finding for full cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exceptions to full cost recovery is based on the prioritization of other goals, such as resident's needs and the ability to pay and maintaining access to popular city services. And lastly, the theoretical revenues potentially generated from the proposed fee changes will be evaluated and included as appropriate as part of the proposed budget process in line with our financial'",
        "'speaker_1': 'policy. And again, we'll come back we're scheduled to come back April 12th, where city council can officially adopt these changes at that stage. This concludes the presentation. And Geraldine, the department and I are available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you have a motion by Councilmember Ringo to make it a second place. Second Bay Councilmember Sara Canterbury Aranda. Examiner During the presentation I saw some of my questions were answered in regards to where we stand with a market study in terms of where our fees lie compared to our competitors or our neighboring cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we competitive? Are we in line? Or what's what's the status of our fees as compared to those of other jurisdictions? Geraldine?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Council member. Each department presentation included the the comparison to comparable jurisdictions. And in it we found that we were generally inline, but it will depend on particular services or areas that you are inquiring about. So if you had a specific area as part of this presentation, will be happy to have the department answer that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Service calls an example. So, for example, getting on certain stuff is good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're not changing the rules.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, but those remain the same. And in short, they are comparable to other jurisdictions, in our case, Southern California Gas Company. Yes, it's a careful analysis because while we the city charter does mandate that our rates are comparable to their rates, their rates do bake in some cost of services, like turn on turnovers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you mentioned, our laws do not. So it's not quite apples to apples, but we are mindful of equitable charges for our services. Q What do you see as challenges in the future as we continue with this pandemic?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Should it go on another another year or even possibly two? That's a great question. You know, we the state is not giving much guidance as to when we can end moratoriums. In a in a recent memorandum that's coming to you, we plan to end our moratoriums against shutoffs no earlier than June of this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, you know, as our arrearages continue to grow, you know, we need to try to be mindful of maintaining operations. And it's going to be a balancing act to make sure that we're mindful of hardships to customers but being whole as a as a gas utility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll just move forth cautiously. We're awaiting some assistance from the state in terms of mitigating some of those arrearages. And then when we can finally return to the end of moratorium and. Have a tool to encourage payments will be in a better position to evaluate what total cost of services will be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I have there. Council member, Sarah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. So I definitely understand why we need to make sure that we are evaluating if our fees are ensuring that we're breaking pretty much a balance of it being even and not. And but at the same time, it's always hard when we have to increase fees, especially when it's things like and you know, that impacts'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the quality of life of our residents that could range from, you know, parking permit, driveway parking permit to, you know, driveway type repaint and all of that. So I'm just wondering how how, how, how, how would we go about making sure that the fees, like some of them, they're increased by almost 50%, if not some higher, and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's some 82 where it's recommended to lower fee. So I'm just wondering, at what point do you decide, hey, we're going to maybe break those costs out over a number a year? Or like, for example, is it the percent threshold that you say, well, we're going to break them up into two years increment of how we increase'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it, 25%, one year and then 25 the next. And I'm just wondering how how would we go about making sure it doesn't impact people kind of kind of shop in the fees changing and also making it kind of palatable for for residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, with regard to the gas fees, yes, Councilwoman Sara, we're very mindful of that. And so any fee that throwback recommended for a substantial increase, we will defer those increases and implement them slowly so as not to be an undue hardship on ratepayers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some fees we are quite happy to keep at current levels simply because we can maintain operations at those subvention levels. But where we are massively under collective, we do need to slowly roll in. So to better. Manage the cost of our services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. What about public works? Is that similar or because there's there's a lot of things here that might. You know, removing certain things that you in the city like in front of businesses as well. I'm just wondering, is that the same approach to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is the same approach. Yes. And as far as implementing over a period of time, specifically for a couple of those items that you mentioned, the the curb painting and the the other items there, we are facing those in over a period of three years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it'll be one third each year over the next three years, which would then get us to two whole in year three moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, because I didn't realize there was 175 per location and then it would be increased to 325 just to do a painting, a driveway like painting the red. Right, kind of red, what you call red tips, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that's correct. So the study takes into account all of the efforts to actually get out there and do it, including the labor and the materials. The existing fee is currently 175 for the driveway tips and the repaint is 87.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the RCC study did recommend a higher fee to recover those costs, but we do understand it was a pretty significant increase and therefore our phasing it in over the three year period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have council member Austin. Thank you so much for the presentation and I do understand, you know, the need and I do I think we need to be smarter as a city in terms of, you know, recuperating our our cost for poor services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the same time, I'm also mindful of the fact that we are not for profit entity. And many of the services that we provide as a city will never bring the cost for. And that is that that goes along with public works and our gas and energy, energy and gas departments, but with several other departments as well'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I am. And I guess it may be lost on some, but for me I'm concerned. Any time we're talking about raising rates or fees on the gas, the increase in gas fees for services has me a little concerned because of where we are right now with the the the rates going up and increasing literally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the same time, I think to to councilmember sorrows point, you know, children are concerned about the impacts on our our lower income residents and those seniors who are on fixed incomes and who are being challenged with those of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The rising price of natural gas. But also, you know, now the city is is looking at raising fees for various services. And so, you know, I would ask that we would be doing very, very well with extreme caution here and being very sensitive to the those of those individuals who we all represent, say senior citizens, low income'",
        "'speaker_0': 'families who would be impacted by by these fees, rates and or fee increases. Also wanted to. And I. Raise this issue with the city manager a little earlier. But I think it's worthy, too, for a public discussion here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, some of the services that our public works department provides are obviously indirect services to businesses and residents. But, you know, we as city council members, we may get a complaint. We may be responding to a constituent request or just a notice, for example, you know, painting curves in a business district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Anything, you know, of green curves. Of red curves. These are these are things that we don't necessarily you know, they're not celebrated and talked about. The city council members have to be attentive to those those issues, particularly in support of our our businesses, communities and where it relates to the safety of it in those those areas'",
        "'speaker_0': '. My question to the city staff is how if a city council office would request those type of services, are we going to be charged to see a budget that we may control for such fees? Or is it coming from somewhere else?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can't remember. This is Eric Lopez. I know you won't be charged. We still have our regular maintenance crews that do street maintenance that will handle some of these requests. This is for either more regular service from, say, an apartment complex or another private property owner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not for our regular maintenance. So no, you will not get charged for the regular work will still continue repairs incurred in our right away and maintaining them. This is this is just an added an added work to recover some fees for working extra work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you for the clarification. It helps a lot, you know, from time to time. You know, Mr. Lopez, you know, we have a request, special request waiting in the alley. Know whatever it may be, sometimes those photos or even of speed bumps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Because those those those are those works. Those come from our our our our district budgets. All right. I just wanted to get some clarification and show that this was a where we were going. So thank you so much for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, like I say, my concerns, you know, please do not take this into account. Are our rate increases or fee increases for for those who are already rate payers or for gas and energy who are lowest income. I think we need to build in some small provisions to account for those type of hardships.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman. Awesome. Thank you so much for your comments. I just really want to emphasize that of the proposed fee increases, none of them are to individual ratepayers. All of the increases are directed at construction and new development in fee increases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nothing to that an individual gas ratepayer would incur. I definitely appreciate that clarification. Thank you. If you count on her supernova. Thank you staff for the report. I have kind of a general question and I hope there's a simple answer, but my question is, how do we how did we get to this point?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I just to foster use the phrase areas where we are massively interconnected. So if we have a city price index, I'm just wondering how we get so far behind. I assume that might be due to regulations that you're subject to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if there's a simple answer, I would like to hear it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council member. So our last piece of citywide study that we had was back in 2006. So fast forward to now, it is through this citywide study where we are taking a very close look at our fees and charges and realigning to the cost of service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's been some time and even in the interim, we do have the routine processes in place for us to review as well as the city cost index. The city cost index is a general inflator that is applied to all departments, are all applicable fees and of course that's captured across all departments versus this more specific in-depth'",
        "'speaker_1': 'study per department at the service level area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if I hear you correctly, it's it's it's the the time passage that has done this. So we 2006, that's a while back. So if we did this on a more regular, consistent basis, we probably wouldn't fall this far behind.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. Councilmember And I do want to note that following the completion of the study, there is a cost of service model that will be available to departments as applicable. And as we move forward, departments will be able to reassess their cost and then also their levels of fees and charges.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I have Councilmember Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Inky so much. I just have a couple of questions. I thank everyone for the presentation. I am with regards to temporary no parking fines. Does that fee change also apply to no parking fines related to neighborhood cleanups or community events?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. It does not apply. So the idea that it does not apply.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Thank you. And then also, Bob, thank you for your your informative presentation. I wanted to ask if your team has looked into subsidizing like home weatherization, like insulating attics or the walls as a way to incentivize gas uses reduction in older homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see Bob's on the line, but I can I can answer that question. The short answer is yes. We do have several home efficiency programs that are available offering rebates and in-house services to help customers be more efficient in their consumption of natural gas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Very public comment. On this report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If there's any members of the public who'd like to speak on this item, please press star nine or use the right hand function. Our first speaker is Dave Shuker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. Nice to see this agenda. Right after the previous item. Can you hear me? Yes. We hear you. Thank you for confirming. So. We're talking about gas and energy, but not specifically about which utilities other than gas, not electricity, not waste services refuse collection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It'd be nice to only see some more specificity, but how these different institutions relate in the city now specifically calling for a market study for comparisons is a very good idea. And yes, it depends on which particular services the city kind of wants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is something I think community choice aggregations as well as the DWP. I mean, there's different models, but more integrated models are just better for, you know, deployment. They're they're more effective. They're faster, more responsive. The community owned and controlled the city owns its own assets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's something I got to keep telling you until we're entirely corporatized. Um. What else? Oh, yeah. So, what are the big things that I wanted to say on this item when I first read it last night was that I'd like to see some dark sky principles for our city lighting and city contracts with lighting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Look at Pittsburgh as a comparison. It works for safety. It works for cost. It works for the environment. There's a lot of things in the city that we could do. But again, you know, we need to. We need to we need to do so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here is an immediate truth and reconciliation freebie. It's not a rape, nor is it a read. A real estate investment trust. Moderate. But you could restructure measure U.S.. To be in line with signal. That's that there was a missed opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Putting it indexing it to the consumer price index instead of the producer price index. And that would more than double the money, especially now that we're going to have a period of ramp up in the markets, even though we shouldn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With oil and gas, this is the year. Ladies and gentlemen, science tells us we should stop oil and gas. Period. So every moment that you delay is something that you know you're doing wrong. And it's important to say that on the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But yeah, you know, if we're going to keep using oil, tax it properly and let us use those moneys properly. Thank you.'",
