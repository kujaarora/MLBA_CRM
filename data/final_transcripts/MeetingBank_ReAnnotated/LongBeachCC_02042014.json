    "Resolution Opposing Changes to the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act.": [
        "'speaker_4': 'Clinical read item is a report from the city attorney with the recommendation to adopt a resolution of the City Council of the City of Long Beach, opposing bills or ballot measures that would weaken the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. JOHNSON.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, thank you, Mayor. I believe we have some folks who've come out tonight to speak both. I think we have some people from the medical community and the legal community. Can we go ahead and hear from the speakers?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you like a motion, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor, of a statement as to what way? Oh, sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, you know, this is a very controversial issue. I know we've discussed it in the past. This is a state issue that's been debated for 39 plus years, will continue to be debated for many years to come. So I personally think that because there's no initiative that's qualified, there's really no reason for the city take a position'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And I think we should just stay neutral, see if something qualifies and if it does qualify, we can come back, take the position. So with that, I go ahead and make a motion just to receive and file this item at this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Moving. Seconded. Please come up. Those who wish to make a comment, please identify yourself. When you see the yellow light, it means you have 30 seconds to conclude. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mayor Foster. Council members, thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight. My name is Tammy Smick and I am here to speak to you about our experience with Micra and to urge you to oppose any resolution that would support micra.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is our 20 year old son. Alexander Smick. He was born here in Long Beach in 1991. Alex died due to medical negligence on February 23rd, 2012, at an Orange County hospital under the care of Dr. Daniel Hedrick.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alex was prescribed and administered a lethal combination of medications that caused his death within hours of admission. Shockingly, after Alex was administered the combination of medications, he was left unmonitored without even a blood pressure check for over 7 hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When he was finally checked on during morning rounds, Alex was found dead already in rigor mortis. After nearly six months, the Orange County coroner determine the cause of death poly acute drug intoxication. When we received the coroner's report, we thought that some governmental agency would leap to action and hold to account those responsible for our son's death'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We were very wrong. What we discovered was that doctors and hospitals are very insulated from accountability. And we learned that if we wanted to hold the doctor and hospital accountable, we would have to seek legal action. We are not litigious people, but we wanted to make sure this horrific treatment would not happen to another innocent victim.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's when we learned about micra. Alex was a college student studying to be a surgical technician. He wanted to work in the medical industry. Erotically the very industry that caused his death because he was not a wage earner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Michael limits the value of Alex's life at $250,000. Michael also limits access to the legal system because of the high cost of litigating a malpractise case. My husband and I have invested thousands of dollars to ensure we have our day in court and to fight for justice for Alex.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our fight is not with the many wonderful doctors who responsibly treat patients and save lives every day. But our fight is with this system that would rather protect dangerous doctors than protect patient safety. I implore you protect patient rights and oppose any resolution that would support my micra.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Sorry for your loss.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And next, please. My name is Tim Smith. And I'm a very angry father. Alex was my son. And I'm here to urge you to oppose oppose any resolution that would support micra. I'm a father who grieves every single day over the loss of my son.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I suffer constantly from the image of my son's cold, stiff and purple body as he lay dead in the hospital bed where he sought help. Alex died a preventable death at the hands of the medical professionals from whom he sought help as Alex was dragged to death in a hospital.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we are fighting to stop this tragedy from happening to another innocent victim. We only lost we not only lost our beloved son, but we have been victimized by micra. Micra has made our access to the legal system very difficult.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Doctors take an oath to do no harm but when they do negligently harm patients they need to be held accountable. Patients and their families should not have to fight against an archaic law such as micra and multibillion dollar insurance companies when seeking accountability.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please do not rush to judgment in support of Micra. I urge you to contemplate this. Have $250,000. Was fair in 1975. How can that same amount be fair in 2014? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir. Next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You didn't council when it was Peter Mackler, who is the executive director of the Government of Communications and Public Policy for the Memorial Care Health System, which Long Beach Memorial, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach and Commune Hospital members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I applaud Mr. Johnson in his opening comments a few moments ago that this is certainly a complex and difficult issue and telling our thoughts and prayers go out to the previous speakers. I am here actually to ask for your vote on the resolution on 14 to 8085 to oppose any changes to the Michael Law.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Act has served to keep health care costs in a state down and it does indeed stand as a national model. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office estimates that the projected changes could cost local and state governments tens of millions of dollars if they attempt to quadruple the noneconomic damages becomes a reality.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As severe a domino effect would take effect and affect. Each of our shared constituencies are bound to be affected at a time when every hospital an integrated health system such as memorial care, is facing unprecedented challenges due to considerable reductions in our reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid and the prospect of higher health care costs due to an'",
        "'speaker_2': 'increased insurance premiums and more complex claims will certainly take its toll on communities to the cuts from the Affordable Care Act. Across the board sequestration reductions due to the sustainable growth rate, the memorial care health system is facing almost half a billion dollars in reduced payments over the next ten years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And despite these challenges, the three Long Beach based medical centers provided our communities, our shared constituents, with over $67 million of quantifiable community benefits in fiscal year 2015. And that includes over $17 million in charity care for the uninsured and the under-insured.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this also includes $33 million in local breast cancer screenings and prostate screenings and neonatal classes and such other community based programs. I mentioned the domino effect. If our rates were to increase, which they surely will, coupled with the federal and state decreases, no health care system in the state will be able to sustain community services at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the current levels. If nothing else, if the cap goes up, so do our attorney's fees and the time needed to negotiate. And this is money that is desperately needed in the communities as memorial care health system. And every health care provider in the country is working hard to truly transform the way we deliver care in our communities'",
        "'speaker_2': '. It is critically important that might not be changed. May Council I thank you for your time and I do ask for I vote on resolution 1485.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. I'm Tina Kim, assistant director of policy at the Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County. Khaleesi represents 53 federally qualified health centers, community clinics and free clinics throughout Los Angeles County. Our members operate nearly 200 clinical sites throughout the county, providing medical, dental, mental health and pharmacy services to over 1 million and duplicate patients every'",
        "'speaker_0': 'year. The majority of whom are uninsured or underinsured. In Long Beach alone, eight clinical sites operated by three of our members alone serve over 38,000 patients annually and provided over 106,000 medical encounters in 2012. The vast majority of patients served by the clinics are low income.'",
        "'speaker_0': '69% live below the poverty line and 58% are uninsured. I'm here to urge the Council to adopts the resolution before you today with an eye vote. The trial lawyers push for a potential November ballot measure to change Medicare would significantly undermine clinics local efforts to continue providing much needed high quality care to the underserved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'CCRC has been a longtime member of the coalition Californians allied for patient protection. We strongly support micra. It is fair and allows clinics to focus on the important task of providing health care to all of those who walk through the doors regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As the largest regional association of nonprofit community clinics and health centers in California, we do have a stake in the game when it comes to Micra. Surely changes in the law proposed by the trial lawyers will greatly impact the clinic's ability to keep doors open if the trial lawyers are successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Increased lawsuits and higher attorney payouts come with a hefty price tag that not only affects local and state governments, but also affects the very patients clinics serve. Michael would be altered in a way that makes it easier to sue health care providers and triple lawyers legal fees in the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Meanwhile, clinics will be forced to offset higher health care costs and medical liability rates by cutting expenses elsewhere, such as reducing hours, cutting staff or reduced services. This will only make us further out of reach to the people who need the health care our clinics provide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Therefore, it is important that you vote in support of the resolution. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Q Next, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Honorable Councilman. My name is David Kim. I'm a family physician in the medical director of the New America Medical Group Clinic off of Bellflower and Stearns in the former Borders bookstore. And I'm here tonight because we are in a time where, as a primary care doctor who is managing other primary care doctors, we're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'having a difficult time drawing primary care doctors into the field. And if this proposal to change micro limits goes through, it will make it even more difficult for us to draw quality care, primary care doctors to practice in the very areas of Southern California that we most need into practice and we are already experiencing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A real need and a dearth of primary care doctors to serve the communities, to be able to keep patients healthy, to keep them from becoming ill in the first place. And that's really a transition that we are feeling and moving toward in America.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think anything that will make it more difficult for us to incentivize or to create an environment in which to allow those physicians to practice in the way they desire. And why we went into medicine, I think, will really hurt our cause and hurt our community to keep them healthy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the the very the increase in cost that any change in micro will bring will ultimately lead to a decrease in service to the very public that I think that this measure or this change to micro is proposing to protect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the fact that it. Comes across in a way that I think lacks integrity by throwing in this bill to measure and screen doctors for drug abuse and then kind of funneling in this change to make her afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was leaving a target the other day and someone asked me, would you want do you want to sign a petition to screen doctors for drugs and alcohol? Please sign this petition. And I said, no, thank you. But I think that there's such a more profound conversation behind that, that the public, I think, deserves to be engaged'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in. And I think for them to hide behind this initial sort of tagline and then expect it to be passed and slide this migraine behind the change in Medicare, behind it, I think, really is disingenuous. And so I really urge you to consider this thoughtfully and on behalf of the constituents that you serve and and the patients'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that I tried to keep healthy to really oppose any change to Micra. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, doctor. Thanks, blue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Council members. My name is Barry Thorpe. I've been a resident of Long Beach for 49 years, a resident of the fifth District for the past 23. I'm I'm here not to talk about what may or may not happen with Micra as it's changed or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm I'm here to talk about what's happening in Long Beach today something that some of you may or may not be concerned be aware of other and that I'm I'm here because 119 days ago my sister Laura was a patient at Pacific Hospital in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She was there on a non-threatening, non-surgical stay. And over the course of a few days, over repeated acts of negligence and neglect, she was given an overdose of medication. And over the next few days, went to multiple organ failure and died.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the time of my sister's death, two state lawmakers both expressed concerns about patient safety at Pacific Hospital. One of them, state Senator Labus, specifically stated that he was concerned about the mismanagement and mistreatment of patients and the potential for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not a potential because it happened. Now, the nice gentleman offered thoughts and prayers to some other people that spoke about their loss and thoughts and prayers and concern to lawmakers. I suggest do not substitute for viable legal remedy and you don't have that currently in a Micra with a $250,000 cap which is 25 years old'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The amount of of deterrent value that this offered to the numerous people at Pacific that watched my sister decline and die and did nothing to stop it. It's meaningless. It's almost a cruel joke. It's an illusion of a remedy because we immediately encountered problems to even get an attorney that would be able to represent us and address'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the problems at Pacific because of the limitations of Micra and we worked hard to find one and we found a very good one and we were very lucky because we had the ability to do that. I'm sure other I'm sure other people are not as lucky.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would ask that there is no haste to, to to weigh in on this resolution, on this initiative before it's even qualified. Let the process work out. Let people hear both sides in Long Beach about whether or not it's appropriate to adjust micra for purposes of patient safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm asking you to do that as as a citizen of the city and as a person who knows firsthand just very recently why this is something that really does need to be considered at length. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Eric Andras. I actually sent you all an email this past week with a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Information, and I hope you all were able to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Take a look at it. My sister, Cali Andrus.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Was mentally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Retarded. She had the learning ability of a four year old, and I took her to the E.R. one night because she had a terrible stomach ache, and two days later she was dead from medical negligence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The hospital refused to give her any pain medication for 15 hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The poor thing just sat and suffered in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Horrendous pain for 15.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hours. When they finally gave her medication, they gave her a drug called Dilaudid, which is seven times stronger than morphine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Even though she had only been.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Prescribed a low dose of morphine shortly before they gave her the Dilaudid, they gave her a radioactive beverage to drink for an unnecessary CT scan. Because of the sedative effect of the Dilaudid, she ended up aspirating that radioactive beverage into her lungs, which caused pulmonary edema and sent her into cardiac arrest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The hospital was under the wrong assumption that my.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sister was a DNR.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A do not resuscitate. So while she was laying there in cardiac arrest, they were standing there doing nothing. When they finally realized that they were wrong. They called a code blue and they were able to bring her back 17 minutes later.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it was too late. She was nearly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Brain dead by that time. This is when I finally learned about Michael. I had never heard of such a thing. 38 years this law has been on the books and I've never even heard of Micra. When I tried to get a lawyer it took me over eight months to get a lawyer to take my case and it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'only I only ended up getting one because I started advocating for patient safety. Over a dozen lawyers turned our case down. And this is what everybody that's that's going through medical negligence these days is going to. My sister had no husband.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She had no work. She had no children. So she only qualifies for the $250,000 cap. So what lawyer is going to take that? It costs sometimes $100,000 and in fees to bring a court case. Then you've got $75,000 in lawyer fees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You've got to take that out of the 250,000 before a victim can even see any more money. And then that's in 1970 $5. By the time $75,000 is left in 1970 $5, it works out to about $17,000. That's what a medical negligence victim gets these days because of micra.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a horrible law. I've actually been in contact with senator barry keene who wrote the law in 1975. He has come out and he has written a statement and I sent you all the link to this and he is also for raising the cap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He wrote the law and he's for raising the cap. So I beg of you all please do not support anything that has to do with with promoting Micra. It's a terrible law and it's really affecting a lot of people who are suffering from medical negligence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. My name's Betty Brown. I'm here because of my sister, Tamara Walter. That passed away four years ago from medical negligence. She went into the went into the clinic for a minor procedure and 20 minute procedure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And never came out. They ended up putting her in a room.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A recovery room, forgot her, and she suffocated. As the other gentleman said, too, I wasn't even aware of my crew if we went out to try and get help to see attorneys to to make some changes and couldn't get any help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I happened to have the opportunity to go to Sacramento a couple of years ago and work on the SB 100 and we bill and we got it passed, which is to improve the standards at the clinics and hospitals, which I hope helps because of the limitations with Medicare.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's very hard to get any type of, you know, help with attorneys. And my sister also was single, had no children. So her life wasn't worth much either. You know, the last two, the rest of the families just horrendous.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please. You know, a. You know, we have to make change to make. We have to see people, you know, in the future. And the only way that's going to do it is if we are able to hold the doctors and whoever accountable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And unfortunately, the only way to hold them accountable is financially they don't care. You know, it's and there's a lot of great doctors out there, you know, just the few that don't care. Hopefully if we make changes that will affect them anyways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, other than just being a victim of the medical negligence, we're also you know, we're a victim with with with the micro, you know, with not being able to to do anything. So. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Miss Byrne. Next with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Dr. Carlos Martinez. I'm a local ophthalmologist. I have been in practice here for the last 13 years, and I have served as chairman of ophthalmology at Memorial. I have served a quality assurance on memorial quality assurance in Los Alamitos at Reagan Street Surgery Center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am interested in taking the bad apples out of the community, and I have done everything I can. And the truth is that every one of our colleagues and every one of the cases that I've reviewed have always been about caring doctors, trying to do their best in a field that is incredibly difficult.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the answer to the problem is not changing. Micro. Micro. There are no caps for gross negligence. There are no caps or economic damages. So the idea that raising the cap for pain and suffering would lead to a resolution or would lead to taking those who have made mistakes or acts of negligence out of the field is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just not the case. If I thought that that would solve that issue, I would support changes to micro, but I don't think that's actually a factor in the whole equation. So I support the resolution that you have come up with supporting micro, and I invite everybody to have a discussion about how to solve the issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Victor Christie. With Californians Allied for patient protection. I'm here to urge your support of the resolution to support micro micro works. Any change to Micra will only jeopardize the citizens of Long Beach and all Californians ability to access quality health care.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is wrong to increase health care costs for every citizen of this state, especially now at a time when we are implementing the Affordable Care Act. We cannot return to the crisis that led to the passage of micra where the san jose mercury news then stated that insurance rates will peril medical care in the Los Angeles Times'",
        "'speaker_2': 'stated then that doctors face an insurance crisis which will affect 8000 in the Southland. Yes, regrettably, there are individual tragic cases of medical negligence that no one ever, ever wants to see. But this is not the way to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Changing Micra is not the solution. That is why we have a broad based coalition of community health centers, public safety positions, labor, the Department of Public Health of Los Angeles County and more than a thousand others to support micra.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I respectfully urge and I vote please protect access to health care. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members. My name is James Ah Christie. No relation to the last speaker. I have been a resident of Long Beach for over 20 years. I'm an attorney and my law firm represents victims of medical negligence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One case that we to give you an example of the kinds of cases that I that I see. I represented the parents of a 25 day old baby who went to the hospital with sepsis and high fever and five days later was about to be released.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The physician said he's he's going to be okay. Let's release him. The mother said, I'm not going to take him home. You can see he's jittering. The baby had symptoms of seizure all these five days that he was in the hospital on that last day that the physician decided he would needed an emergency MRI of this infant'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rushed him down to the MRI room. The baby went into cardiac arrest and resulted in brain death at 30 days old. We won that arbitration. But the most that it was available to that family, those those parents was 250,000, not apiece, but for both of them together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is a couple they still go to the park every birthday with a birthday cake to commemorate Jayden's birth. But I'd really like to speak about the people who can't get a lawyer who are victims of medical negligence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I see them all the time and my heart really goes out to them. They can't get a lawyer because the cap is too low and the economics don't work out. Is so expensive to litigate the medical negligence case, they cannot find a lawyer to represent them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's why it's socially responsible to lift the microcap. It's going to provide access to justice. It's going to make physicians more responsible for the care they give. And I respectfully urge a no vote on this resolution. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Nicholas Domingo. I did not know that this issue was on the agenda today, and I'm not prepared to talk about it. I am in the medical care field and. I make my living by that. Also, I had a mother who died in a local hospital.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She stated in front of witnesses that she wanted to live and that she wanted treatment. And despite that fact, a DNR was placed on her without authorization. The only person that could. In the world. Agreed to that DNR was me and I didn't even know about it was placed without authorization.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then she was denied treatment even. Which would have been given to a deranged patient. She needed to be on a ventilator. And she died. And there were many, many other gross and embarrassing mistakes. I don't know any of these people here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know these two people who suffered the loss of their son. I've never seen them before. But the things that they experienced I encountered ten years ago. I don't have an agenda at this time. I do not have a lawsuit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was years ago. I do know that that hospital probably spent over $1,000,000 on attorney's fees. And they're saying there's no money. There is money. Like in most other aspects of the world. Businesses are money driven. Anyway, at the very end, I watched my mother suffocate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. The nurse at this hospital knew that that was happening and didn't even stand up because at that point she was a legitimate DNR because there was no more treatment for her. And she suffocated. And then they tried to usher me out of the room so that they could withdraw the medical devices and carry me out so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they could get on with business. It's very, very difficult to obtain an attorney because of money. But the hospitals can afford high priced attorneys. And they do. And again, I get no penny for this. I have no agenda, no lawsuit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Mayor, council members, I thank you for a brief minute. My name is John Hinman. I live in Long Beach. I live in the second district. I'm a small business owner in the third district. I employ two employees who live in the second district and I believe the fifth District.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I practice medical malpractise defense for four years in Long Beach at a prominent defense firm and I now practice medical Malpractise plaintiffs work along with Social Security, disability, employment, and a variety of other things. I have to tell you that I urge you strongly to get all of the opinions of all of your constituents and the people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who really know what's going on about this before you make a decision. I think that's most important. I have two brief comments. First of all, I think that the bar to filing medical malpractise cases is the fact that you need experts to come out and say that there was medical negligence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is a huge bar to filing these cases. And I think to claim that the $250,000 cap is the real bar to filing these cases is not necessarily the reality. Second of all, I want you to know that I have, in my short four months of representing plaintiffs, have had to have several tearful conversations with folks who'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have clear liability cases. But because of the complexity of their situation and the 250 cap, I was unable to represent them.

They're encouraging them to contract with the city of Los Angeles because they understand how it helps specific neighborhoods.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The ordinance was passed in November, and it was a hard fight to get the ordinance. I was on that first committee. We weren't a commission then. I was on the first committee and we set about trying to decide how in the world to address first things first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This survey was first, and after this survey, the most important item on our agenda were incentives. Because how in the world would you ask someone to to do the unthinkable, adding up money that they didn't even know they were going to have to add up because of stroke properties?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't have an answer. How are they going to care? And and now that we have an ordinance, somebody cared, we thought. So that was a real tough fight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it took.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us a very long time to get any incentives. And now we have the Mills Act, or we did have the Mills Act, which because of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Fees that are involved with restoring a property, the C of A.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fees, it's it almost evens out if they get a tax incentive. And I just want to encourage you to remember that you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Care about historic properties.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You did write an ordinance. You also care about sustainability. We're a green city, and you also care about affordable housing. All of these things are accomplished with the Mills Act and it was a hard struggle to get it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's get it back. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. My name is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Steffi Han's address. 2149 Kallon fifth District. I'm also a realtor with real Remax real estate specialists here in Long Beach. I specialize in historic properties myself, my clients, my friends.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We all own these homes and we all spend a lot of money restoring and preserving them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Improving the property improves the street, the historic district, and ultimately the entire city, and also helps increase our property values and hopefully revenue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the city. Los Angeles, Anaheim.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Orange have implemented this program to great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Success.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I really believe that the reenactment of this program will greatly further improve.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. I'm Emily Stevens, and I'm a resident of Rose Park. And many here can speak better about the Mills Act than I can. However, I didn't want it to go by without mentioning to you that if you are looking at it from a financial aspect, the people that are incentivized to renovate their home move into these'",
        "'speaker_0': 'neighborhoods and take on that burden and do a good job doing it. They fill the job of the police, the fire department. There are so many aspects of that financially that the city will benefit from. So when you look at a cost of a program like this, I think that it would be very difficult to assess monetarily'",
        "'speaker_0': 'what the residents are doing when they renovate the home and they move into a neighborhood and try to renovate it to a historic capacity. But they are actually bringing alleviating services from other parts of the city. That was all I wanted to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do support this. I hope you do it real soon. Thank you. My name is Kathleen Irvine. I'm the president of Whitmore City Heritage Association. I live at 539 Daisy Avenue in the First District. And I know from personal experience with my 1905 bungalow.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The amount.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of money that you would get from the Mills Act Four if it was reinstated, will not make up for the incredible amount of money that you will put into a historic home. That being said, I appreciate that it's being brought.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Up and I encourage you to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speed the process along because we all understand that it takes a lot of money. But far more important, I think, is that it stabilizes our neighborhoods. In the first District, there was at least 50% of our homes are owned by absentee landlords.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is a rental city. And I think that if there were.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'More incentive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For people to actually preserve these homes, instead of just slapping a coat of paint on and flipping it, that it would stabilize our neighborhoods, it would stabilize our city. And of course, everybody talked about the character and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We all know that. But I really feel that it would also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Encourage more families to take on that burden of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Renovating a home so that we have more families moving in instead of this horrible flipping of homes of our old homes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's it. Thank you. Thank you, Kathleen. Next speaker, please. Good evening, all. Norman took my wife and I owned two properties on First Street, one on the 1600 block and one on the.'",
        "'speaker_5': '2700 block of First Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': '2003.'",
        "'speaker_5': '2006. My wife and I made two trips to this building here when the Mills Act was still available to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And wasn't going anywhere. I know that today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're many, many years later, and I would really like to know exactly how many single family dwellings we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And unbelievably, condominiums.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Within units that are not the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whole building. Why can't you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Get access to those places to find out to do your audit? But I know that today my wife and I are spending our children and our grandchildren inheritance. I restore old cars. I'm a retired longshoreman. I restore old cars as a hobby.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And my cars are beautiful and immaculate. The buildings that we owned in Long Beach are the same way beautiful and immaculate love.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We spend a lot of money on them and if there's anything we want would get out of that is some kind of break and taxes. Only because I've made a commitment to my old cars and these old buildings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I live in San Pedro, but I love Long Beach. I grew up in San Pedro. I made my living in San Pedro and in Long Beach as a longshoreman. I'm spending that and my pension on the beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Buildings that we own at Long Beach. So the sooner the better that we get the mills back in place. So the individuals like myself and my wife.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can maybe get a little bit of a tax.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Break for us in the last part of our our years, that if I'm talking to you all personally tonight, I would ask that you immediately pressure the office to have this happen now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hmm. Good evening. Thank you. My name is Christine. Velma. 901 East 37th Street in California Heights. My husband and I were the recipient of the Preservation Award from Long Beach Heritage last year, and we've offered our home for the great homes of Long Beach Tours and twice for the California Heights Neighborhood Association.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are very fortunate to own a home by renowned architect James, our friend. When we purchased the home in 2006, we were also able to purchase the original furnishings. The home had never been touched. We bought it from the grandchildren.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It had one coat of paint on the interior and exterior. Everything in the home is original. It was a dream come true for us, but it's been a labor of love. So we purchased it in 2006, right before the markets turned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I immediately got in my application for the Mills Act and it was pretty promptly returned to us in the fall of that year. And it's been devastating for us. People that preserve architecture do it because they know that architecture is art and art is worth preserving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Art tells us who we are and it tells us where we've come from. But this is an expensive endeavor. We began by chipping away at the things that we needed to do restore the electrical, redo the plumbing, remove the fixtures, and have them re chromed, rebuilt, scraped, pushed apart everything delicately with a kid glove.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The home looks much today as it did then. We have changed nothing about the home. But however, our restorations have slowed down tremendously and now we're kind of at the point where we're just trying to maintain the house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for example, on December 23rd, our gas line went out and my husband on Christmas Eve dug up the line and that was our gift to each other. So people in this audience that know and understand the expense of maintaining a home.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know what it costs, but they know why we do it. We do it for love. We do it for passion, but we really do it for the future. So please, as we think about Long Beach going forward, please consider supporting people that support this cause for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. My name is Sasha Witty. I live at three, two, one, four East Second Street. I am the current president of the Bluff Park Historic District Neighborhood Association and have been for the last few years. This is one of the items we get questioned about the most frequently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When is the Mills Act going to be reenacted? Why hasn't it been reenacted? My partner and I live in a 1913 home. It's certainly a labor of love. We demoed out upgrade to from 1913 to 1960 standards to current electrical and plumbing a few years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Found out our second floor was collapsing into the first floor. And needless to say, our kitchen is put off long term until we can kind of recover those costs. So in my personal life, I also work as interior designer, primarily residential, and I would say I work on a lot of historic properties and I work on a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'lot of contemporary properties. There's no comparison in the cost to upkeep, maintain and bring up to date a historic home in comparison to newer construction. And I would just say I'm so glad this is before the council, and certainly it would make a big difference towards promoting and preserving these wonderful historic structures that make such a difference'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in our historic neighborhoods of Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, Tonya is the longest seven district resident address on file. I just want to thank you for bringing this councilmember, for bringing this to the agenda. I think ever since people have heard about this, that it may possibly be coming back, there's been a lot of excitement in the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The sixth and seventh District is not downtown. We're not the fanciest neighborhoods. But I'll tell you that any hope to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Be able to save the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Homes that we see as beautiful I think is a plus. I hear loud and clear from staff that it is difficult, extremely difficult to do from their perspective. But anything worth doing is difficult. And I've heard loud and clear from the community that they want this and that they wait long enough.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anything that you see when you drive down the streets, especially in the beautiful seventh District, Councilmember Johnson is is is an asset to the entire city. And when we get recognized for historic homes and buildings as a city, it brings not only recognition to us, but, quite frankly, visitors and money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think in the long run, we win. I hope that this passes. I hope that we get this done quickly and that we don't wait another eight years. Everyone wants this and we have enough resources in the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot of the speakers that you heard tonight to be able to help you figure those things out, the the the barriers, the the the blockades or whatever you want, the excuses. But there's so many people here that want to I think we have the brain trust here to get it done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaker Wendy Horn 3214. East Second Street. Third District. I'm speaking on behalf of Long Beach Heritage and we emphatically support the reinstatement of the Mills Act. We are all about the passionate identification, restoration, protection and preservation of historic properties, iconic and within the historic districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So anything that can be done to expedite that, we would support strongly. We feel that's a minuscule economic impact compared to the vast gains that you'd have in growing your cultural artifacts. Then as the co-owner with Sasha Whitney of our home at three, two, one four East Second Street in the Bluff Park Historic District.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City council that approved my ability to move that home from across the Long Beach Art Museum in 1989. And at that time, they were extremely supportive, as I assure you all are, of historic preservation in historic districts. And I worked very closely for two years with then historic preservation officer Ruthanne Lear in the moving and restoration of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that home. 23 years later, my that old, we still have quite a bit of work to do and we have also gotten some awards and recognized. And it's a wonderful property. We're enthused, we're excited. We love living in a historic district and everything it represents in this city, and we are excited to hope that the city would'",
        "'speaker_0': 'reinstate that. I too had applied and was told at the time. I think there was about 40 people on the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Waiting list and they weren't even accepting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any more applications many years ago. So we definitely are supportive and would encourage anything that you could do would be a great incentive to us. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And our final speaker. This is done. Let's move ahead. Let's advance. Look at linger in the past with old buildings that are dilapidated and if they were updated would still.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Look old fashioned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because renovation means doing the new. But building again means making it even more new, maybe functional. I recognized one building in particular the brick rubble on Ocean Boulevard and Alamitos that has some historical value that I haven't been able to ascertain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Architecturally, it's really unique. But it is really one of the best offerings. The historical sites have to really offer something Lincoln preserved. Now, the ranch, the ranch that we have with tours, tours and that sort of thing, that's kind of nice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think the art museum is a nice building, too. But what you haven't seen are the rest of the buildings. And interestingly enough, not one picture has been shown. These buildings that are going to be renovated, changed, changed to a new will generate more revenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The bill. Let's bill. Let's not sustain the old. It just doesn't look good. Architecture advances its modern. Let's not Long Beach be an old fashioned community. Let's advance and certainly some buildings. I would I would surmise most of the buildings are just not beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And by making it trying to make the more beautiful, you discover the fact that it can be rebuilt. Probably a lot cheaper. And if not cheaper, more beautifully. Thank you. We have one more speaker. Please come forward to the last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The one to get behind the. I just wanted to get the previous speakers name if it was on file yet. Mr. Dunn. Career? Dunn. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. We're going to go and take it behind the rail over here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're gonna start with Councilmember Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank all the speakers that came forward, especially those that have been working on historic preservation for quite a long time, from the neighborhoods and and those who served on the Cultural Heritage Commission, i. The questions I had, I think have been answered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then council memberships get asked about what year the element was. The historic element was passed, and that was 2010. And I think that had been excuse me answered as well. So I wanted to thank Council membership scheme for bringing attention back to this council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On this item. I first became aware of the Mills Act when I lived in a loft in the Kress Lofts, which at the time we had not qualified for the Mills Act yet. But certainly that building being one of the newer buildings, having come back online through adaptive reuse, we were looking forward to that and appreciated how'",
        "'speaker_0': 'oversubscribed the program was that it was oversubscribed because I believe we have well-intentioned homeowners that would like to preserve as much as they can of their historic homes. From there, I moved to another historic neighborhood, Rose Park, and the home is a 1917 home.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it is a labor of love. It's very difficult, but certainly worth doing. And so I want to thank you council memberships for bringing this council back in. Focus on the issue. It has been quite a while since we've discussed the Mills Act, as you mentioned earlier, but the topic remains very popular in the second district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as we heard from Councilmember Yarrawonga, it's popular all throughout, regardless of which district we live in. But if we just look at the intent really of what we want as a city, what residents want, I think we do want the same things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We live in communities like this because of its history. And one of the speakers earlier indicated what history really meant to us. And preserving that, it tells us where we came from and it informs us really where we're going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I appreciate that if if my memory serves me, we approved the element in 2010, which I think Amy's confirmed. And at that time we committed to reestablishing the Mills Act program after evaluating contracts and implementation from the last program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think if we look right at language from the element, it says the city will reestablish the Mills Act program for owners of designated historic properties and will implement a program to inspect and monitor existing mills, act properties and to review new applications to ensure that proposed projects meet the Secretary of Interior Standard for Rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I can appreciate some of the original concerns associated with that loss of revenue to the city, especially given the last decade of budget cuts and positions eliminated in the city serving on the Budget Oversight Committee. That point is not lost on me, and I recognize that many of council's directives here are heaved upon the shoulders of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'development services with an expedited timeline. I, for one, am guilty of that. And you can you can smile, Miss Burdick, because, you know I am guilty of that. We do put that on you and we everything needs to be yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm concerned that that we and our consultant are still evaluating properties at this point. I had hoped to see recommendations for a new program by now. I don't know the details of what goes on in those evaluations, but it's been a long time properly performed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Improvements provide a return on our investment in the form of higher property values, which in turn leads to increased revenue coming back to the city. I'll just talk about Rose Park. Rose Park today is not what it was 11 years ago when we moved into it because of the work that homeowners have put into it, with or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'without the Mills Act and it has raised property values, I can assure you, just from my own personal example, it really has what my neighbors have done through blood, sweat and tears and hard work has assisted the entire neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we know that to be true. So in that regard, I think we will make up those lost revenues through increased property values, perhaps changing of hands of these properties, although many of us, you know, would like to stay forever in our homes, it's a reality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so in that regard, I think that's where we make up this loss, this anticipated loss. And so I'm not insensitive to it, but I do know we will make it up if we do support neighborhoods in bringing these properties up and raising the entire area's property value.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In some, the mills act as a useful tool for preserving our city's heritage and a return on our collective investment. I firmly believe this. And so, Councilmember Lipski, I'm happy to support a motion that you put forward. I'm delighted that you asked me to coauthor this with you and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Honored to do so. But I will take your lead. I would like to see us move forward in a direction where we can make good on the original intent of our 2010 historic preservation element.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Counselor DeLong. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, I have a few questions. First, Ms.. Broder, could you just take a minute and describe how we've used the Mills Act in the past to just tell us what the benefit is to the residents, perhaps what the cost has been to the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just give us a quick overview of the program when it was enacted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't have the financial numbers in front of me of the of the potential tax losses that the city has has incurred because of contracts with the Mills Act. It is a clearly a benefit to a property owner of a home that does require significant improvements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They do receive a discount and state and federal taxes for the work that they put into their property. It is clearly not a 100% rebate and the property owner does get does bear a significant burden of those improvements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it is meant as as it was stated several times tonight to incent property owners to maintain their properties or to restore properties that have fallen into disrepair. We do also have folks who purchase properties in historic districts, and they know of the possibility of a mills act and they try to forestall improvements until they know that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'they can get some relief from their property taxes as part of a Mills Act contract. We do believe that there is a value in reinstating the contract, the contracts. What we do need to do, though, however, is modify the ground rules under the contracts to deal with some of the the issues that we've had with the program'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in the past. And that's what we're in the process of doing. The City of Los Angeles does have an annual cap. There are other cities that only allow a certain number of applications that are per year. So it's not necessarily a dollar amount, but it is a number of applications that they're willing to accept in a year'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So we're looking at different models to see which one would work for Long Beach. Once we do that, we do have to calculate what the potential financial impact is. But again, as as Councilwoman Lowenthal said, it is very likely that a lot of that impact could be made up in increased property values over time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So, for example, if I if I bought a home for $500,000 and I put $200,000 into it, what would be the financial benefit to me and what would be the impact on the city?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's based on your property taxes, not the value of the improvements that you put into it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So let's assume that the value of the property went up to $200,000 for my additional investment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The value of their property went up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Bought it for 500,000 that my tax base, I bought 200 into it, which added $200,000 for the value.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So now you have an assessed value of 700,000. Yes. Okay. So you're paying taxes on $700,000. You get a portion of that rebated. I don't know, portion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of the incremental 200,000 in value.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you've made $200,000, yes, you get a portion of the value of that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So a portion of $200,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. I apologize. It's based on the 700,000, the total assessed value of the property.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So is it possible that I would pay less taxes for this home that was worth 700,000 than I paid property taxes when it was only worth 500.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can't answer that. Right here, right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Can we just about how did the program work before? Was it first come, first serve? Do we have any caps, any limits? How did we determine that? A property qualified for a mills act?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It was first come, first serve. You had to be either a in a historic district or a designated landmark. And those contracts were entered into based on some some very general bullet points of what the property owner was going to do in terms of improvements for those homes, for example, a home.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the property owner would make the improvements and be able to take a credit on the property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what was the and how is the amount of that credit calculated?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't have that that information in front of me. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And how many homes are currently covered today under the Mills Act in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Individual homes, we have about 31 individual homes and we have almost 200 multiplex condo units that are also covered by the program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what are your concerns regarding the multiplex units? I noticed in your opening remarks you think they shouldn't be covered or is it the way we're covering them today? Doesn't make sense. The reinstatement of the program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The way we're covering them today does not make sense.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you have a six plex condo building and three of the two of the property owners do not participate in the Mills Act, but four of them do, and the entire six owners agree to improvements to the building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's very difficult to determine the value of the credit that should be derived for each of the individual property owners. If some of them did not, you know, did not have a Mills Act contract. If someone restores a window in their unit or there's a lobby that gets restored and that's covered under common area maintenance charges or'",
        "'speaker_7': 'an ATO, it's very difficult to ascertain the level of the improvements that were made that should have been historic in nature. That should have been just your condo reserve, that should have been applied to the individual property owners.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So your recommendation being a multi-unit property that all the units need to be applying for the Mills Act?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All the units need to apply, but the applicant would be the away and not the individual properties.

        "'speaker_8': 'Once the calculation is made of the historic property risk component, what they call the capitalization rate and the property tax component. This person now is, instead of paying 3125 in property taxes, is paying 1135 for a savings of 1990 dollars.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'There's nothing in here that that that that refers to that. I've actually read the deals act where there is some sort of a little bit more transparency with state employees as far as disclosing the terms of the contracts upfront.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so in that regard, I think you may be on the right track, but what I'm also concerned about is the additional and unnecessary cost that could be associated with some of the the proposals here specifically related to hiring outside counsel to negotiate contracts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, if we don't have qualified employees here to do that in H.R., we need to get them because that is a perpetual interest that the city has. I mean, contract negotiations don't end at the end of contract negotiations.'",

So I'm really concerned about the additional cost that that could be associated with this. I will agree that during this last round of negotiations, there were some areas where I had some concerns about, concerns about I'm not sure they're fully addressed here.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Ashton, I appreciate your comments. Although you did talk to me about perhaps having an outside negotiator for the management portion of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you're right, I did.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that is that's prudent. And it eliminates any sort of conflict if that is the case. But this doesn't say that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, if I can, I will I will add that I know the Miller is Myers Brown at backwards and forwards, having represented numerous city employee groups. And I will tell you, nothing in that act prohibits us from doing this whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This in no way impacts the rights of the two parties to negotiate. It is not bringing the public in to the bargaining room. It is simply getting information out to the public in a timely manner. And perhaps maybe with the substitute that I think Mr. DeLong did, the city attorney can come back.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's what my request was. And in fact, if there would be any difficulties in terms of the contracts online, there is no cost associated on those contracts. There is no financial analysis published either for the council or the public about each contract term and the cost.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is much different than just posting a contract online so that this goes beyond that. And then I would be very interested from the city manager's point of view what the added cost would be for us to be transparent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think, you know, the fiscal impact, as I put in the motion, is to be determined by the city manager and we don't know. So perhaps a separate from hiring a independent negotiator for the management team, I would be very interested to see what the costs would be involved for the other issues here, too.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think maybe in Mr. Lang's motion that could be covered when we get the report back.'",

I'm not averse to receiving a report from the city attorney or staff on on any aspect of this. And then we can take up any recommendation that any council member may bring forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there's no recommendation here, and it's asking for a report. And that's where my support is coming from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Dillon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. You know, Councilmember, often I share your concern about adding any cost to the government process. But like Councilmember Lowenthal, I guess what I thought we were doing was asking for some additional information here. I'm certainly not wedded to it has to be done this way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But, you know, maybe a maybe a third. It's this good, maybe a half, maybe 80%. I don't know. I think I'll have a a better feel for that up to the city attorney and the city manager come back with some kind of report for us to to review and discuss.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But certainly, I would share your concern that, you know, does it really make sense to hire an outside firm to do all this? Perhaps not. Maybe it does for management, but it doesn't for the other labor groups. And I would certainly be, you know, very open and interested in that kind of a discussion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But at least I to have the information come back so we could have that kind of discussion. So that's why I support the the motion that's on the table.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's get along just for you. Just repeat what the motion is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Basically, yes, the motion is to request the city attorney to provide a review of the city of Costa mesa Civic over openness, negotiations, ordinance and the feasibility of a similar ordinance being adopted by the lobby, city council. And for the city manager to provide, you know, perhaps a memo that determines the feasibility from a staff and human'",

        "'speaker_3': 'All right, Mr. Ralston.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thanks. Thanks a lot. I do appreciate, like I said, that discussion. My my my real concern here is that we the collective bargaining process is difficult and complicated enough, as is with the dynamics that exist by further complicating this and politicizing it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it will it will dilute and pollute the process even further. And so I think and I don't mean any disrespect to to to the authors of this agenda item. I just think we need to move forward very carefully using Costa mesa as an example.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Costa mesa has not been the the the example city that we want to follow in terms of our labor management relationship. And so I would I will just rest on that.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, you know, I had the same response when I saw the draft of the of the item. And Councilwoman Chavkin explained it to me when I brought that to her attention when she said that the ordinance was actually developed cooperatively between management and labor.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And I think what everybody's trying to do, or at least with the motions trying to do, is to see what the pros and cons of that approach are. And quite frankly, you know, I mean, people say if it's not broke, don't fix it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that doesn't mean if it's not broke, don't improve it. And you at least should have some information out there as to what some alternatives are. I know there's a lot of nervousness. I don't know which election period and all that stuff.'",
