        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. We have a great professor there. She was the smartest of our entire group, just so you know. It's true. So we with that, let me go ahead and go back and we had item nine was pulled from consensus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's hear number nine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Report from Health and Human Services recommendation to execute an agreement with California Governor's Office of Emergency Services to accept and expend grant funding in the amount of 306,000. Thousand 666 for the My Sister's Keeper program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you. And we did have a comment. Customer Pierce wanted to comment on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just I have our director of the health department, Kelly Colby. I wanted to hear a report from her. I think that this is an amazing grant and that we need to really recognize the work that we do and take it outside of our department so that our community can be engaged and understanding what our city's working'",
        "'speaker_6': 'towards. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you and good evening, honorable mayor and City Council members and I thank you for the opportunity to share about My Sister's Keeper. This new funding of 306,666 from the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, otherwise known as Cal OAS, continues a highly successful program that was previously funded to the Board of State and Community Corrections.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we've been operating this program for the last three years with with the from be from the. Their program is ending. That funding has ended. So we applied to colonias for additional funding to continue the program. The goal of the program is really to reduce victimization and commercial sex sexual exploitation through serving at risk females within the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'city of Long Beach. My Sister's Keeper program is an anti-human trafficking program that revolved around the city prosecutor's office and the Long Beach Police Department's directed services program. So it's a court diversion model, which is designed to assist women who are engaged in prostitution related offenses and are likely being human, sexual, you know, victims of sexual trafficking'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And so what they really done is start to identify those who are being who are being trafficked. And instead of being identified as criminalizing it, they're moving it to a victim, moving to a victim focus. So the model is really an incredible partnership between the police department, the city prosecutor's office, our service providers and the health department'",
        "'speaker_8': '. It's changed the system from viewing trafficked individuals as victims instead of criminals to us. And they've also streamline the process. The police provide citations to women. They give them an order to appear in court on the Monday. So it used to be a month, month and a half out before a person could show up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now it's if they're seen on Thursday, they come in on Monday, they get a phone call on Monday morning reminding them to show up. And then while they're in court, they're actually provided opportunity to divert from any sort of criminal justice opportunity, instead, two services.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they're provided trauma related services, case management and tattoo removal. In the past year, we've seen over 100 tattoos removed. So the service providers learn about you know, they explain the program. And at that point, they can connect and be diverted from additional opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And with the criminal justice system through the previous My Sister's Keeper, we are able to assess more than 200 women through this project. And in this one, we're going to be looking at, we're seeking to assist 40 more, but also to really look at additional data collection, to understand the long term impacts of this program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're excited to continue this great partnership and this important work. And that concludes my report and open for questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Customer Pearce, anything else to add to that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to say in Bixby Park is one of the areas in my district where we've had a lot of issues and a lot of constituents concerns. And I've witnessed our police officers and our heart team out there really working directly with some of these women.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it really has made a difference. So I'm proud of this work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. A mix up as we have Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just wanted to chime in and say this is really important funding and it does really important work. And I've seen the work that Theresa and the Health Department has really led, particularly in North Long Beach. So thank you for this and I'm happy to support this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Councilman Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great program. I know that members of the Junior League had a presentation from information that was put out by your office. It was a very informative presentation, and I think that the more people that are aware of it, the better we are, because it can happen right in front of you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you. We're going to go to we have a short public comment just for people. I mean, the first two items up on the agenda will be the item around homeownership and the Olympics. And so for those that are here, for those and then the rest of the agenda.'"

    "Feasibility of Increasing Homeownership Opportunities for Low and Moderate-Income Individuals.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. That concludes the public comment. Let's go into item 15. During the homeownership item than the April 28.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson, Councilwoman Mango Councilmember Aranda and Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request City Manager to evaluate the feasibility of providing increased pathways to homeownership to low and moderate income individuals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So this item, this proposal tonight, we want to elevate the conversation about expanding opportunity for homeownership opportunity here in the city of Long Beach. Homeownership remains one of the best opportunities and best ways to build intergenerational generational wealth and to close the racial wealth gap.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I grew up a renter in a rental household. When I was 25, I became a homeowner. And I understand the dynamics and the benefits of of such. And when people are in their homes, they tend to be more financially stable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their children perform better in schools, their communities are healthier. I know that there's a conversation and a lot of discussion around the lack of housing availability and opportunities for renters and things like that. But I wanted to elevate this this topic of homeownership to bring it more forefront into the larger conversation about housing in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Historically, families of color and low income communities have systemically been locked out of opportunities that homeownership provides this goal. This dates back to before any of us were in a policy position to create public policy from things like covenants and other systemic issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Currently in Long Beach, black and Latino families own their homes at half the rate of other households. The trends of this low of low homeownership rates in communities of color have roots to America's long, long history of housing discrimination.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On December 11th, as part of the Everyone in Economic Inclusion Initiative, my office in partnership with Local Initiative Support Corporation can convene the first of a series of roundtable discussions with a multidisciplinary group or think tank to take a deep dove into the issue of home ownership in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At the roundtable, we heard a presentation from the Green Leaning Institute, who recently, along with the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, analyzed the latest homeownership trends and mortgage data which examined statewide figures, as well as lending patterns in Long Beach, Fresno and Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The think tank was able to dig into these findings, provide some feedback and make some great recommendations that I'd like to forward on to the city council tonight. Access access to some degree of wealth is critical to every family's economic security.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wealth functions as a financial financial safety net that enables families to deal with unexpected expenses, disruptions of income without accumulating large amounts of debt. And we know that intergenerational wealth transfers of wealth can play a pivotal role in helping to finance college education.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Higher education, provide downpayment assistance for your first home for family members, first home for second home, or offer startup capital for launching a small business which is a part of many folks American the American dream here. Because communities of color have less wealth today, black and Latino adults are far less likely than younger than other young people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from other races to receive large sums or any money at all from a family member to help make a large investment in their future, like support for their college education or assistance with their first home. The result is that the racial wealth gap continues to perpetuate from generation to generation with profound implications to the economic, security and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mobility of future generations is the national conversation. But there's a lot to do with what we can do locally to address this. Currently, black households only only hold about 6% of the wealth compared to other households, which amounts to a total wealth gap of $104,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Latino and Latino households only own 8% of the wealth of other groups, which equates to a gap of $102,000, according to the Green Lighting Institute study of Long Beach home lending practices, recent research researchers found persistent exclusion of low to moderate income families and people of color from Long Beach's housing homeownership market, for example, African-Americans make'",
        "'speaker_3': 'up almost 14% of the population in Long Beach, but they receive about 7% of home loan purchases, so about half of what their representation is in terms of population. The same goes for Latino populations. Latinos make up 41% of the population here in Long Beach, but receive about 22% of the loans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Asians make up 13% of the population, but receive 10% of the loans. This is compared to other groups who make up 30% of the population but receive 47% of the home loans. Furthermore, home mortgage data shows that while mortgages are being purchased in low to moderate income neighborhoods, they're not necessarily being being purchased by low to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'moderate income individuals at 6%. So. So what that tells us is more than a quarter of all homes went to low. More than a quarter of all mortgages went into low to moderate income neighborhoods, but only 6% went to low to moderate income people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So put simply, higher higher income individuals are buying homes and working class neighborhoods at dramatically higher rates than working class residents who are often. In Black, Latino or Asian. Now, you know, there's a lot to sort of explain and how that works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When I first purchased my home in North Long Beach when I was 25, I was a low and moderate income individual. When I acquired my second home in North Long Beach, I was not a low to moderate income individual.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what? It doesn't necessarily tell you what those stories are, but what it does tell you is that that opportunity that I had when I was 25 is is not necessarily there for others to break into that to break into the home or homeownership game.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition, a down payment affordability check. In addition down down payment affordability challenges remain the top one of the top reasons why low to moderate income individuals are not purchasing homes at the rate of their of their counterparts, according to Zillow's 2017 Housing Aspiration Report, which surveyed renters in the greater Los Angeles region.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While while mortgage payments are more affordable on average, monthly rent paid then monthly rent payments. Renters are struggling to buy a home due to down payment barriers. So on average, mortgages are cheaper than rent in average. Nearly 70% of renters cited down payments as the single greatest barrier to homeownership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Coming up with a down payment is more of a barrier to homeownership than debt, job security or qualifying for an actual mortgage. Finally, one of the most surprising findings from the green lighting report was that the largest lender in Long Beach is not a bank.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And seven out of the top ten mortgage lenders providing mortgages to our residents are non-banks. What's the difference? Traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions don't just make loans. They take deposits, they offer savings and checking accounts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They offer ATM services, other family supporting services. Non-bank lenders don't offer those service services. They're also not regulated the same way as banks, but not that's not necessarily a bad thing. We're seeing a rise in non-bank lenders, largely because of in the post foreclosure crisis, the regulatory environment changed from a risk management regime to a zero tolerance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and 100% compliance regime. So it's more difficult for banks to generate these loans. And so the non-bank lenders have stepped up to provide opportunities to low to moderate income individuals. They're the ones servicing VA loans. They're the ones servicing FHA loans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the pullback from lending from banks continues to, you know, to provide an overall decline in homeownership, because people with slightly risky credit profiles are significantly underserved by banks who might have a branch in your neighborhood. So consumers with marginal credit scores or unverifiable income or traditionally are almost completely out of the market now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And now that we have identified large presence of non-bank lenders in our community, I believe that we have an opportunity to engage non-bank lenders. The way that we engage banks, we meet with banks. We typically have a community based conversation, something about conversations, about investment in the community banks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't have any mechanism to really engage non-bank lenders when the data shows us that seven of the top ten, which also includes number one, number three, number four, number five of the people doing business in our city are non-bank lenders.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They know they're not they're not on our commissions. We're not engaging them. And this is a major part of our local economy, a major segment that we need to engage on on a more significant level here at a city level.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long Beach can design policy solution solutions to expand pathways to homeownership for our most underserved communities. Given that down payments, are those the most significant barrier to buy? Your home in our city needs to do better and do it do more to pull together resources in order to help families make that leap into homeownership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I recognize that during the loss of redevelopment, you know, the 20% set aside, we don't have the financial resources to engage in the way that we did with down payment assistance. And I acknowledge that. So to bridge the gap, we can work with bank non-bank lenders, provide more downpayment assistance or to work with work with them to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'craft special programs, a special outreach tool to sort of close the gap. Cities all around California are finding innovative ways to do this, innovative ways to offer down payment assistance without necessarily writing a direct check from the city's coffers by tapping into, you know, things like Bonds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Private partnered with private and nonprofit agencies to provide that capital. For example, Los Angeles or Los Angeles offers a low to moderate income down payment assistance program, partnered in part by neighborhood housing services with L.A. County. So the county provides the resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city does the on on. So the city is sort of the servicer of that, and they are a partner that is interested in doing more with us here in Long Beach, the city of Santa Ana, and called Culver City.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They pull together resources by utilizing CDBG and in tapping into the Wish program, which is funded by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. So I propose that we research down payment assistance programs offered by private and not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Providence institutions and find a way to streamline it with our city's efforts. In addition to helping long these residents secure the means for purchasing homes, we need to do more to help help people prepare for responsibilities and challenges of homeownership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Establishing a HUD certified homebuying counseling education center in Long Beach will bring significant benefits and valuable benefits to aspiring homeowners. Homebuyer education and counseling can provide powerful support for prospective and current home ownerships homeowners, too, as they assess their options to become homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The evidence suggests that homebuyer education counseling can can help. It can assist aspiring homeowners, expand their housing searches and enjoy more options. And it allows them to help avoid risky mortgage mortgages, lower their housing costs, improve their credit scores, save more, and keep their residual income, avoid delinquency and foreclosure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So finally, we know that laws and supply and demand in the marketplace dictate when housing demand plays out. We know that when housing demand outpaces supply, then the prices go up. So while down payment assistance program housing education is absolutely needed, we with a limited housing supply and stagnant wages, our residents are struggling and still struggling to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'find a home. So we should look at alternative forms of ownership, like community land trusts, cooperative homeownership models. There was a lot of conversation at the think tank about this, for example, in Austin, Texas, and New York City.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're partnering with nonprofit housing organizations to create permanently affordable homeownership opportunities for low income neighborhoods. And so a land trust is where a nonprofit acquires the parcel of land and sells that land or pieces of that land to homeowners or developers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So your source is sort of a co-op. You're owning a piece of it if you didn't have to have the capital get into an entire property yourself. So there's currently 225 community land trusts across the United States representing 20,000 rental units and 15,000 home ownership units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know our cities taking the company, you know, having a conversation about establishing an EDC, well, CBDCS and EDC in Los Angeles and all across the county, they they up they participate in trusts as well. So when so, you know, cities like Washington, D.C. have begun have began implementing innovative alternatives to homeownership with a tenant opportunity'",
        "'speaker_3': 'purchase act. So something else we can look at that gives tenants the rights to purchase property where they reside. If the landlord or landlord wants to sell the property here in Long Beach, we have an opportunity. We have a responsibility to further examine the feasibility and provide the opportunity to our residents, expand our opportunity to residents to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really buy into the homeownership concept. So with that, I thank thank you for your time. And those are my comments. And I make and I move support for the item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President. Vice Mayor, I think you said it all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You thought it was the State of the Union 30 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Then you said it all. And I also want to thank I was looking through this item. I want to thank LISC and the Green Lantern Institute for providing a lot of the data here. You've obviously, obviously brought forward a very thought provoking item, one that needs our attention.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think financial literacy is extremely important in all communities. We should be more engaged in doing more to assist residents in our city and our workforce as well, and becoming more financially literate so that they can build wealth for their families.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And of course, homeownership is something that we've been talking about quite a bit. There's been a big conversation around housing here in the city of Long Beach. Homeownership should be part of that conversation. And certainly when folks invest into their neighborhood, they do have skin in the game and in the community and they make for great neighbors'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And so I fully support this item and look forward to getting back something from a city manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Let me go to a public comment and I'll come back to the to the members of the council. Please come forward. Keep your comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We when I started this. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak before you. My name is Brenda Rodriguez and I represent Affordable Housing Clearinghouse, one of the nonprofits that's listed in this report. And I'm here because I want to let you know that affordable housing clearing house has over 27 years of supporting'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the affordable housing needs of Southern California. And we stand here today. I stand here today on behalf of our board of directors ready to assist the city of Long Beach in establishing the HUD Counseling Center. Affordable Housing Clearinghouse is a HUD certified nonprofit agency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We provide housing advocacy. Homeownership opportunities, and we also own affordable rental units here in the city of Long Beach. So we were vested in the city of Long Beach, and we want to help those families that are low to moderate income, not just on one on one counseling, but also in budgeting their their finances and providing long'",
        "'speaker_5': 'term financial literacy, because these are some of the most important things that they need to accomplish in order to become low, long term homeowners. And if they're already living in the city of Long Beach, it's important for us to provide them with the tools and resources that they need to be successful homebuyers and avoid foreclosure or know'",
        "'speaker_5': 'where to go in cases of foreclosure. And so we're here to support each of your districts, and we're ready to sit at the table and let you know who our long term partners are. You already have businesses in the community that include HSBC, Wells Fargo, farmers and merchant banks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so with the partnerships that we bring to the table, we can already start to have the dialog not only with yourselves representing your districts, but with the community members that you serve. And so again, my name is Brenda Rodriguez with Affordable Housing Clearing House, and I'm happy to entertain any questions and and have a dialog with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi, everyone. Thank you for allowing to speak here today. My name is Benjamin Chow. I'm a community organizer with Housing Long Beach, and I'm also a constituent of the ninth District. I live right off of Cherry Avenue by the 91 Freeway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As an affordable housing advocate and a constituent. I would like to first express my appreciation for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor Rex Richardson's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Effort to address the affordable housing crisis we're facing in the city and also in our neighborhood. And I think it's important that low income members of our community have accessible pathways to homeownership and housing security. I also just want to point out that there are more actions that our district needs to take in order to uplift our'",
        "'speaker_8': 'residents and ensure housing security for all of our members. I want to point out that three out of five Long Beach residents rent and I know that you you had mentioned that you wanted to focus on housing. But I also think that renting is a very important part of this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And for this reason alone, we need to include provisions for renters and the EV1 initiative. When my family immigrated to the U.S. 20 years ago, the only place, the only place that we could afford in Long Beach was a one bedroom apartment in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was five of us fitting into this one, this one unit. And it was only after ten years of renting that my family was able to afford a down payment for the home that we live.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In now in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, that is not the case. And in those ten years, a lot has changed in North Long Beach. Home prices are going up in addition to mortgage rates. And it's becoming more difficult for renters to make that transition to homeownership.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And without laws that protect tenants from unjust eviction, renters will still have difficulty on their path to homeownership. When my family was renting in Long Beach, we had to move around several different times because whenever we brought up an issue with our landlord, we were asked to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vacate in 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I think it's very important that we provide stability to our rental market as a crucial piece of making sure that our residents have a pathway to ownership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I also appreciate that you've.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Included community land trust and cooperative housing, but there are many more options that we need to consider. Also, since the housing bubble in 2008, a significant fraction of the homes in North Long Beach are being rented to us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have to take that into consideration. Again, I'm grateful for this initiative and believe that home ownership is important to our community, but we also need to make sure that renters are protected and secure as well. We need to make sure that we build more affordable housing as a part of this holistic, affordable housing plan in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Long Beach. And we need to make sure that we have reasonable control on the rental market, including renter protections such as just cause eviction and rent control.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Again, thank.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Speaker, please. And these are the last four speakers on this item. People on the line. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is Status.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am a resident.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of Long Beach District eight. And also I work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For a bank. So I'm here as a residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And also to show that banks are here to support.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We partner with a lot of nonprofits, like Brenda earlier.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Said, with affordable housing clearing house, with NHS of Los Angeles, with LISC. All of the names that were mentioned, and we do have a down payment assistance program that we give out. For example, we can give 7000 along with the wish program, 15,000 with this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Connie many of 60,000. So if you add up those money, it's up to $83,000 in downpayment assistance. Who is using it, as he said, someone who is not low income. So we have to really make sure that a low income, low to moderate income individuals are using it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we're making our programs just available for low.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To moderate income individuals. And I'm here to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Support a residents and as also a banker. So I'm here available. That's all I have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi, Jane Tamplin 623 Rose Avenue. I'm here as a resident and as a member who's been invited to participate in the Everybody in roundtable, where we've gotten a lot of information. A lot of that information is about barriers of our own residents unable to buy homes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think we all agree that a city of homeowners is a lot more preferable than a city of renters. There's more investment, there's more pride, there's more involvement. And as people are getting jobs here, they want to live here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think I support everything that's being done, everything I've been heard of, some of it, which is very new to me and I'm very excited about. And I just wanted to come forward and ask for your support also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Through the last two speakers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Good evening. My name is Zita Daniele and I'm the national director of Community Lending and Strategic Partnerships with New American Funding. We were listing in your outline, and I want to thank Councilman Richardson for inviting us and telling us about this event today, because I want to first and foremost say that New American is excited to'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We want to do more. Being able to sit around the table with you and discuss the needs and how, for example, we can encourage and excite low and moderate income families about becoming homeownership, I think is the first step.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can tell you just kind of looking at the outline for today. You know, I know Brenda very well in the work that her organization, Affordable Clearinghouse, does. I know the work that L.A. Family Housing does and L.A. NHS does because I'm on both of their boards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think you've chosen and identified some wonderful partners partnering with Lewis, for example, to host that that green lining that that roundtable, I think was also instrumental in. I should, as a point of disclosure, say that I'm on their advisory board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I say all that to say you are partnering with the right people. I'm so glad that I could be here today because we want to say and I want to say on behalf of my president, my CEO and our CEO, as well as our branches and our staff throughout the area, that we want to be a'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And we want to look at ways that we can leverage relationships with non business banks or business banks, I should say, to create more homeownership opportunities. I will also tell you that we embrace it is part of our philosophy at new American funding to leverage bond and down payment assistance programs wherever we can at the request of'",

I happen to be the president of the Young Relatives Division of Los Angeles, which is a affiliate, the National Association of Estate Brokers, who happens to be for the last 70 years, a most decorated trade organization when it comes to fighting for advocacy for homeownership'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And even worse, if you're in a black household, you will need 228 years to amass the same wealth that our white brothers and sisters have today. When I look at the National Association of Homebuilders, who suggest if you're middle class, nearly 70% of the wealth is in the equity in your property, surpassing your retirement stocks and bonds'",
        "'speaker_4': 'savings accounts combined. It's how we send our kids to college, how start a business and give our kids their start in life. So when I look at this data and I look at the growing rates of Long Beach in terms of a black and brown community, our objective is clear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We simply want to be a part of a conversation that allows us to collaborate together. And when I think about it, right behind me, my young protest, please stand. These are real estate professionals working right here in the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what I can tell you. On the front line is that people desire to own a home. The credit capacity tends to be there, the income tends to be there, or we tend to fall short as on down payment assistance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In California alone, last year had nearly $25 million of unused money geared towards down payment assistance programs that went unused. But the ability to educate, to get the word to the community and to be a partner together is vital as we rebuild forward.'",

I want to first just say congratulations again, Vice Mayor, for doing all the work on the front end, bringing people together, constituent stakeholders, making sure that we have the right lending organizations at the table. You mentioned a lot of fantastic things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A couple of things that I wanted to to raise up is, I think one of the challenges that people feel like when they learn about homeowner assistance programs as sometimes it sounds a little sketch, right? So I think as the city, what role can we play in educating and packaging a program that includes everybody at this table'",
        "'speaker_6': 'but that we're giving it that validation? Like you mentioned, there's a lot of there's a lot of organized organizations like you mentioned that we're not banks, right. That are out here in inner city doing this lending. How do we make sure that we are partnering with good partners and packaging and branding that and engaging our constituents in'",

We, Vice Mayor Richardson, always does a really good job of inviting and introducing new groups of people to the council chamber.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for those of you who've never been here today or been here before today, I thought you did a really nice job of weaving in what you do as professionals every day to this item, because it makes us see what how a concept can become a reality through the professionals who are actually going to be out there'",

We pride ourselves on being the classics capital of America, and nothing is going to allow us to showcase that more than improving the facilities that we have, that where'",

        "'speaker_5': 'With the Olympics coming and the sailing events being so heavily focused around the pier area, I think the opportunity to rebuild the pier and enhance its its its status as an iconic facility in the city of Long Beach is very important and I'm looking forward to that and I'm glad that it's one of the eight projects same'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as the case for the Belmont Pool. Obviously, we've set aside more than half of the money that we need on the project, and we have an incredibly engaged and active community, dedicated and committed to seeing us raise money and look for alternative funding sources to be able to completely fund that project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm very, very pleased and proud to be part of that, that project. So I'm glad to see that that's on the list of eight. The other thing that I think is really important, and I know Councilmember Pearce agrees with me on this is our lifeguard towers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our lifeguard towers are really in bad shape. They don't reflect the quality of the lifeguard program that we have here in the city of Long Beach, the great work that the men and women of the lifeguard division of our fire department do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so enhancing those facilities, I think, will go a long way for building community pride, but also making us look like the precious gem that we are within the region when spectators and Olympians come to town. This is a really great opportunity for us to think about creative ways to partner with public and private entities, potential grant'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And many in my side of town reflect back on the year of 1984 when we hosted before. And it's only appropriate that we get our house in order and ensure that we put our best foot forward for the world.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I look forward to many sponsorship opportunities for our large facilities, similar to the $70 million donation splash naming rights that were just received in L.A. for the Coliseum. I hope that we have a couple of $70 million offers right here in Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And so I had a couple of questions. I, as you guys know, had some concerns about the Olympics in the beginning of supported it. I think that they've done a great job in making sure that there are community benefits tied to the city, as there's been about a decade conversation around what happens when Olympics come to our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'city. And so I want to applaud the city for working with them on making sure that we're getting some of those community benefits for putting this list together. There are items on this list that I had some concern about before, and I've had a couple of emails, so I just wanted to publicly address them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On naming the Belmont Pool. I was not here for that vote. I know that it is with the Coastal Commission right now and we have, as Councilmember Price mentioned, half of that funding. One of the things I like about this item is that it's lifting up Long Beach and saying, we're open for investments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're open to make sure that we have good corporate sponsorships, that we've got good athlete organizations that are sponsoring. And so I find this is a great opportunity to make sure that we're not carrying the entire financial burden on our backs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I look forward to hearing what comes back from the Coastal Commission on that. My favorite project on this list is definitely the beach concession stands, something we've talked about for a really long time. The Alamitos location is going to be phenomenal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I met with staff today and we hope to have some kind of groundbreaking by the end of the year, hopefully. I don't know, Tom, if you want to talk just a little bit about that in the RFP process, because it is something that is probably my favorite project right now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, Councilmember, we have been working on creating some pretty stunning designs on how to engage people on our beach, to come and visit concessions and be able to to have a great experience. So those are there's three different projects.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We are bringing those forward to the planning or to the Coastal Commission. They've already gone through Planning Commission. They're really designed both for residents and visitors alike and coastal serving users. So we're hoping to get that through the Coastal Commission by the end of the year and to continue to put together the funding.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so we can do a groundbreaking. We're fingers crossed by the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. And I also want to recognize that on that concession stands, I know we've had a couple of conversations with Dolby and other folks about that. So just for the first time, we're looking at breaking up those reps and being able to have local businesses in there, whether it's oysters at one and burgers at another'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So I always have to champion that any time it comes up. So my other question is really around the conversation, around housing. I looked at L.A. and it seems like L.A. is trying to get to 100,000, 100,000 new housing units to be developed by 2028.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And part of that plan was that you're going to have athletes housed in these units, and then once the athletes leave, that those would be converted to affordable housing. Do we have any plan to house any of the athletes in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So none. Not this time. The way that they're creating it, most Olympics create an Olympic village, and that's really where they house the athletes. And that's right now plan for for L.A. but we are going to be the hub.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So they're designing us to have people come down here and not just have one event or two events, but really to have a center. So we're a major center, the Long Beach Center. But as of right now, housing down here is not one of the projects that they're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I know that there's we'll probably hear in community comment tonight some concerns around housing impacts. Any time we've had this and I know there's some studies that show some good reports. Are we going to have an annual report on the 2028 list?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we can certainly report back on how we're doing. I think that's part of the report is to let you know what the timeline is. And then, yeah, we need to stay on target and report back. I do want to answer your question about housing, though, is that is clearly something we've heard from the council that we'",
        "'speaker_10': 'need more housing and that there's been a goal set. I believe, Mr. Mayor was 4000 units in it, mostly in the downtown area, and we're well on our way. So we are building a lot of housing. There is a number of skyscraper projects that are either breaking ground or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Moving forward. So housing is important and you'll see in ten years a much different downtown than what we know today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Mr. Modica, I would like to ask that whenever we get our annual report on the eight projects that we also just have a report about how our housing is increasing. I know that this council and the mayor is taking housing really seriously and just want to make sure that we're following that along with all the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'work that we're doing outside of it, so that we're addressing the conversation head on. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you, Amir. You know, I'm really excited about the you know, to my colleagues who are bringing this item forward, you know, also along, which is a long story history and, you know, athletics and the Olympics, you know, good preparation starts early.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think working that we do to prepare for the 2028 Olympics could be successful and financially viable, you know, which will create jobs. And I would really like extremely like, you know, to ask the city manager focus a lot on local employment and the implementation of these eight projects to a greater degree possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is very, very important, I think, to me and anyone else who lives in the city of Long Beach. It's employment, local employment. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. And I like to speak in support of this item. This is very exciting and there is obviously a lot of work to be done in the next ten years. I was out at Skog last weekend and I heard a presentation from L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'He gave a pretty comprehensive presentation, and the expo actually included Long Beach in the presentation as well and all of the the the games that will be here. He also talked about the Olympic Committee agreed to to frontload some financial resources to to the L.A. Olympic Bid Committee.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. Mayor. And I was curious to know whether or not there's been conversation, to see if any of those resources will be available to Long Beach. And in terms of what to help us get to these these projects, if you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And maybe Tom can add. So there's some some extensive conversations going on around funding opportunities, both on the community benefit side as well as on the construction side. So on the community benefit side, for example, we're looking at the as people probably aware, the L.A. Olympics in 84 was one of the few Olympics that actually made'",
        "'speaker_1': 'money. And the foundation around that Olympics is still actually putting money out into the community through their nonprofit work. So one of the things that they're looking at this year for the 28 Olympics is they're looking at a long term plan to provide essentially to pay, particularly for low income families, all of a kind of athletic programs'",
        "'speaker_1': ', swimming programs, parks, recreation, youth programs, and trying to be able to fund kind of a master youth sports program that would last for a decade plus for the communities and where the Olympics is actually in. So that is something that's being actively discussed and a goal of Mayor Garcetti's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in addition to that, we are we expect some substantial opportunities to work, obviously, with with the Olympic Committee on opportunities to kind of close some funding gaps for us that we might have in in these projects.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great. Well, I look forward to supporting this and working as a council, as a city to make sure that we are a great host in 2028.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Councilmember Superdome.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I have a question and a couple of comments. The question is to Tom Monaco. When will you bring this back for a second look. Do you have a date in mind?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't have a date at this point. We can certainly get you back kind of a general report. But some of these projects are further along than others, and they're going to require some additional study on what it will take.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, for example, the lifeguard station, we have not started that project yet. We don't have a time frame or a sense. But for things like the concession stands, we have a lot of information. So I'm hoping in the next probably two or three months we'd come back and have that first look and then let you know, you'",
        "'speaker_10': 'know, further what needs to be done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So I won't frame my comments as a friendly amendment since this is coming back again. We can discuss that. But first, I just want to follow up on Councilwoman Mango's comment about the L.A. Coliseum, or maybe we should call it the United Airlines Coliseum, $70 million, but it's only for 16 years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that's a tremendous opportunity, I think, that we can look into, and I would hope that would be studied. Also, the one point that is striking to me is, is as was mentioned, so many of these projects are in the Tidelands area and that's great for funding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The downside is that it doesn't engage our entire city or all of our communities, but we do have a prototype for doing that. And I would hearken back to our legacy with the 32 Olympics. And you talk about tough economic times, 1932.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're about three years into the Great Depression, but they had a city wide program to ask the residents to plant vacant lots or decorate vacant lots. And that happened all over the city. The winning lot was on the corner of Locust and 14th, which was nowhere near any of the venues.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as a side note, that was that contest was won by a renter who had only been in the city about five years. The other thing I think we should look at is kind of the legacy of the 84 Olympics.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there are two. They looked at the entire community and looked at our legacy from 1932. So realizing that the traffic circle in the fourth Council District was built for the 32 Olympics, they made sure that torch run went down Lakewood Boulevard around the traffic circle.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we have lots of opportunities to engage the community and get these areas spruced up for the event. So that's all I am. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I wanted to chime in and add my support for this item. I want to also say, you know, I you know, when I drive near the Compton Town Center up Artesia, you'll see that 1984 Olympics logo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think we should also also, you know, make sure that we understand how to frame this to our residents is going be a lot of questions about what what our game plan is, what we're doing. And I'd like to understand better or get a briefing at some point on how there will be benefits to the local'",
        "'speaker_3': 'community in terms of like the L.A. 84 style benefits that were referenced tonight. Those are exciting. They, you know, help support swimming programs and things like that in all areas of all communities. And so I really want to want to better understand that and be able to champion that a bit more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to be excited for this. You know, my girls will be teenagers. I'm thinking about, you know, what sports they can get into now so they can really be inspired at that time. When I look at these sports and I want to make sure that we get some tickets to the Olympics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, thank you. Let me take public comment. Please, please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Judy Clarke is the address. Obviously, I support this measure. And if people haven't thought about it, we will be getting even more venues. As I think most people understand, these are the what happened this summer with the smoke and the fires in L.A. Basin, and there's no indication that will not happen again.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we will be getting more venues. I want.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To turn to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The issue of having the Marine Stadium included in that as a rowing venue. If you recall, two years ago, I came before the council, I think it was during Christmas break when Casey Wasserman's point people called me three times and said they definitely want to have the Marine Stadium as the rowing venue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It will be completely. He understood that the Davis Bridge is going to be replaced. It will be completely compliant. Unfortunately, what has happened based upon some credible individuals, some information that I find to be very far from a very credible individual.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. Wasserman has been. Persuaded away from and somebody for reasons far from commendable has essentially been poisoning the well suggesting that he take it to the first alternative to was up the lake villages which proved out to be very unsatisfactory notwithstanding the overall success of the 84 games because it was so distant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Then there was a place they suggested down by not far above San Diego, equally problematic. Then they were going to put it in Lake Balboa in the middle of van eyes, where even in the best, without any smoke and fires, it's 102 degrees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, there are paradigms that are going to address that. But I would strongly suggest you move forward with the plan to have the Marine Stadium designated it. It will be, as I say, the bridge will be in place within 3 to 4 years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No bench. Those two supports structures and so forth. The Corps of Engineers comes in with about 90 days before or 60 days before and does their thing to hold back the tides and the currents. And so there's no reason why the Marine Stadium should not be the rowing venue for these games.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm going to put my foot on that. You keep that on the neck of the issue because it makes absolute sense to have it here and it makes no sense to have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Any of the other locations that unfortunately.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. Wasserman was steered.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To. Thank you very much. I can. Mr. Good here. I know this is one area where you and I agree very closely. And I, I talked to Mr. Wasserman today, and I can just guarantee you that he's very aware of our interest, our strong interest that for additional opportunities for us to host at the top of that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'list, as you all know, is the event that you're talking about. And so it's a decision, of course, that's not our decision. That's correct. But we they are absolutely aware of our ability to do and host an amazing event, a marine stadium.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that's something that they know. Thank you. Reinforced. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Next speaker good evening, council members and Mr. Mayor. My name is Alan Perlman. I am a senior principal at Studio 111 Architecture, an urban design firm here located right in downtown. I'm also a third district resident, and this year I co-chair the Long Beach, the downtown Long Beach Alliance's Economic Development Committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And tonight, I want to express our strong support for the recommendation to pursue the eight by 28 plan. I think leveraging the fact that Long Beach will be one of the Olympic host cities once again, it's a generational opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It allows us to continue improving our city. And, you know, while completing the eight projects identified by 2018 will be important for the Olympic Games. We believe that they represent infrastructure and quality of life improvements that will benefit all residents of Long Beach for many years to come.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's about really not just the Olympics, but the long term improvement of our city. In fact, Mr. Mayor, we want to take this opportunity to suggest, to think maybe even a little bit bigger, because while the Olympics represent one catalytic event, an amazing event for us, there are other things in play that are equally exciting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if you think about putting them all together, the improvement plan for the L.A. River, the changes to Shoreline Drive, that will really create a totally new experience of coming into the city and a much more pedestrian friendly downtown.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The expansion of the aquarium, the revitalization of the the Shoreline Village and maybe Marina Green Park and a more productive use of the elephant lot and going all the way up and down our shoreline. I think that all of these things point to an opportunity to take advantage of really one of our greatest assets, which is our'",
        "'speaker_9': 'waterfront. And I think if you can imagine a cohesive plan of tying everything from the L.A. River all the way across the city, it really ties the downtown and the rest of the city together into an amazing opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So as a stakeholder in the city and the downtown, I'm thrilled at these opportunities. And I think now is the time to dream big about what we could do for our city while we take advantage of ideas about having equitable outcomes which are extremely important and value capture in some of these projects that really can help fund'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the future of our city and really plan together for ourselves and future generations. As always, the NBA is here to lend its support in these exciting ventures. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, mayor, and members of the council. I'm Jeff Miller. I've lived here a long.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Time and I was here for the 1984 Olympics. And I and my neighbors and friends and I enjoyed them very much and looking forward to doing it again.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have a few comments about one specific aspect of the eight projects, and that's the BBC, also commonly known as the Belmont Pool. The agenda item behind you reads the critical phrase there is for staff to prepare a plan with a needs assessment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What this plan needs is a pool that can actually be built as planned. Now, the Belmont pool is the wrong location. The traffic, the congestion, the lack of access. The visitor amenities are not there. No true cost has actually been given for what this would be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the the money is not there. The in there just insufficient money to build that there. But most important, perhaps, is the issue of sea level rise and other factors that very likely will cause this to be rejected by a coastal commission.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The need here is a pool that can be built. So I urge you to look at building this pool downtown where access is assured. The freeway is there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The blue line is there. All the bus lines converge there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There is adequate parking. There are hotels, restaurants, other entertainment opportunities downtown, the aquarium, the Shoreline Park, all within walking distance for the visitors who will come. And a pool built there could very likely not be subject to the limitations of the one being planned.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And maybe it could be built so that some of the actual Olympic events could be held in our pool downtown, which is not the case with the current plan to put it on the beach. So I urge you to maximize your opportunities for getting the Olympic funds that are going to be available to use them wisely to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'put together a pool that will last not just until the 28 Olympics, but on beyond that, and it will not be swamped by the rising sea. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia, city councilman and women. My name is Gordon and CJR. My address is in file and I am a resident of the third district. And I'd like to speak to you tonight about a request to remove this pool, the Belmont pool, from this eight by 28 recommendation and request by the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First, I'd like to remind you that the project is under litigation by citizens about responsible planning. The carp group following the council's approval of this IIR for the for the pool earlier or late last year, I should say, May of 2017.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand that while the suit may have a hearing in May of 2018, that date is not confirmed. In the likely event of a ruling against the city of Long Beach because of serious sequel violations. There will be important issues that the city must remedy in order to move ahead with an updated or supplemental air.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One official or one critical issue is the fact that the city chose not to identify any valid alternative sites for the project in the event that another location is identified and one that could potentially be outside of the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The mayor's plan for eight Olympic projects may be spoiled, at least five that are planned for the coastal zone. In addition, the appeal to the California Coastal Commission on the city's local coastal development permit for this project is still pending.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A hearing to determine the significant issues has not been scheduled and no date has been set by the coastal staff for the appeal itself. As you know, a number of Long Beach residents have appealed this project and it's also important to remind you that two sitting coastal commissioners have also filed their own appeals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Although this action is not unprecedented, it highlights significant Coastal Act implications that this pool has and its location have for the Coastal Commission, specifically its location on the beach and without regard for the threat of future sea level rise further, it's clear that the pool will never be used for these Olympic events.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's being designed as a hall to host exhibits, and I'd suggest to you that there might be some other locations within the city of Long Beach that might be more appropriate for that kind of use. Specifically because of the funding uses that are funding sources that are going to be needed for the rest of these projects that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'are being proposed. I'd like you to consider removing this item from the eight by 28 project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Q Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. Mayor Garcia, Council Members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vice Mayor Richardson, thank you for bringing forward the home purchase project. I think that's great. We're very excited about having a rebuilt Belmont Pier. I can't tell you how many people I certainly in the third district and around the city will enjoy that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that's a great project. I would like to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Suggest one addition to what you're working on. I think the lifeguard stations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are important, but I think a lifeguard headquarters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A marine safety.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Headquarters, the building that they're working out of on Junipero, is it? It's very antiquated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in September of 2016, the city had a presentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There was apparently plans being made to rehabilitate the lifeguard headquarters. So that was presented in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I've tried to reach the gentleman who was Pine's, who was the contracted by the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I haven't heard back from him, so I don't know where that stands. But please talk to the marine safety people in the lifeguards. They really need a upgraded location and they need extra equipment. They need the room and they need really modern.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're going to have a lot of people to watch over.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And also I join in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Urging you to think about working with the Olympic Committee. If you're going, there's no one who.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Doesn't want the aquatic community to have a nice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pool and they want a pool for events. And that's their large interest for diving, for a water pool, for swimming. And so it makes sense to do what the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Olympic Committee is going to do, which is to put their pool in downtown Long Beach, where there's parking, where there's access. Those things I've mentioned already, and there's going to be even a more beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Place to watch from the pier and watch the sailing. If you let us keep the Olympic Plaza Park and I do urge you to go out there, it's a beautiful scene. There's the park. People are enjoying.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It all the time. You can see the pier from there. You can see the sailboats.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think there's just such a win win of trying to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Encourage the aquatic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Community to get their mind around the fact that there can be a beautiful sand Long Beach aquatic center in downtown. It'll better serve the people who live on the east and west side, and it will cause much less dissension, which we've encountered because of the lawsuits and because of the coastal problems.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I really urge you to to work on that. I'm glad America's in charge.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sure you'll do a good job of putting all this together. And thank you very much for listening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. My name is Johnny Coleman. I'm with a coalition called New Olympics.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'L.A. represents many housing advocates, homeless advocates.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Anti-Imperialist.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Immigrants, rights workers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Groups across Southern California. There are over 30 groups in our coalition as we speak. We launched a year ago. I've spent basically every day in the last year working and dissecting and credit and critically looking at this bid.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm curious to see how many people in this room have actually read the bid. It's extremely long. I've read it many times. It represents a very bad deal that the lawmakers in L.A. have negotiated for. It puts the L.A. taxpayers on the hook indefinitely.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It puts California taxpayers on the hook if it goes 270 million to 540 million over it. And and this is to say that it has been passed by L.A. City Council with no budget. There is no budget for the L.A. 2020 to 2028 Olympics right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is historically unprecedented. This has never happened in 100 plus years of the Olympics. So that's very disconcerting. Not to mention, thank you for whoever brought up the possibility that this might have a negative impact on the housing on people's housing issues, the affordable housing crisis or homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what was not talked about was what this will mean for sanctuary. It is a national special security event, the Olympics. That means that the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and CBP and the NSA, is not only allowed but to encourage to work with local law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if anyone here in this room that's sitting in front of me was a proponent of sanctuary status and in Long Beach acquiring that, then this is directly contradicts and undoes all that work you're doing. Also, it's really interesting to hear you people, especially Eric Garcetti, the mayor of L.A., touting youth sports.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know if anyone's been paying attention to the news recently and what the Olympics do under the guise of youth sports, but it's extremely irresponsible. I also want to correct what someone said earlier about United. The United to naming rights are the Coliseum.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The IOC actually prohibits any city from letting the venue use corporate naming rights during the period of the Olympics. So United, for example, cannot be called the United Coliseum during that period. And they actually didn't know that when they negotiated the bill.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As The L.A. Times wrote about this yesterday, we also talk about the. Legacy of the 1984 Olympics. For who is the question? I work a lot with activists in South L.A. and in Skid Row, and you should ask them what they thought about the 1984 Olympics and all the power that it gave Daryl Gates and how that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'led to initiatives like Operation Crash, Operation Hammer and the 1992 uprising. We'd also ask that the city, if it does actually make any sort of profit, that funds not go to the 84th Foundation, which is a nonprofit and is not accountable to the people that have elected you all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Involved in hosting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Every Olympics ever, such as increased gentrification, police militarization, budget overruns and displacement. Then when the International Olympic Committee cut a deal with L.A. and Paris and gave Los Angeles the 2028 Games, City Hall quickly just flipped to the numbers and voted it through without any more public input or even the illusion of public input or a budget'",
        "'speaker_8': ', as Johnny also mentioned. So in assessing these massive Olympics related projects in Long Beach, I encourage.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'It's a reason that we rejected F1. Racing is the exact same reason that we should be doing that. We're rejecting the Olympics. It is an untenable, corrupt organization that extracts money and works as a displacement engine for especially low and moderate income people inside of the city.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'So I just wanted to, as a democratic socialist, dwell on the undemocratic processes that have got us to this place in 2017. Our City Council approved the city manager to enter into an agreement for the 2024 Olympics, and if so, what Mr. Mayor described as a tweak actually happened.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's sorry. And that's moving the Olympics from 2024. Four years later, it's 2028. Long Beach has to date not approved anything having to do with the 2028 Olympics. This was done under our nose. And we're just going along with, you know, big brother, Los Angeles dictating what's happening here in our city with international business agreements.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So why were the Olympics awarded in 2028? Well, it's actually unprecedented for the Olympics to be awarded this far ahead of time. And the reason, well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In at least.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Many people's opinion that they awarded the 2028 Olympics is because the Olympics are decreasingly popular among cities. More and more cities are waking up to the risks that the Olympics bring. After we've seen devastation and raising rents in London or just so many disasters in Rio.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'People are realizing that the Olympics are terrible for cities. So that's why the Olympics were concerned that if they waited four more years for the 2028 bid process, they wouldn't even have any applicants. So they tried to stick us with the 2028 Olympics right now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so this is why it's so mind boggling to hear the previous speaker talk about how ten years will fly by and how a mr. Monica is saying, you know, ten years really isn't a lot of time to prepare for the Olympics.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's the most time any city has ever had to prepare for a modern Olympic Games. So as I said, I think there were undemocratic processes even when we voted for the 2024 Olympics. It was presented as a done deal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There wasn't much substantive conversation around how this would impact the most vulnerable communities in Long Beach. And now we have another four years. So I would urge the City Council to take a step back and take these extra four years to get more input, do more studies on how this would affect rents, how this would affect police'",

        "'speaker_10': 'and the staff have done a tremendous job getting ready for this. This time at at a December 19th, 2017, city council study session, the Budget Office provided then a preliminary projection for FY 19. This is an update to that preliminary projection, and this update provides a solution to the preliminary budget outlook shortfall.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The updated projection shows a balanced fy19 budget when strong balancing actions are taken. The primary causes of the shortfall that we're seeing are pension costs and slow revenue growth. The updated preliminary projection adds $1.8 million of new revenue and $2.7 million in additional cost.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Budget Office has also identified 11.3 million in additional budget balancing actions if the preliminary projection holds after further upcoming updates and if the City Council approves the balancing actions, we should have a balanced budget. This is great news, but there are some caveats I wanted to mention if there are unusual cost increases for F9 90, for'",
        "'speaker_10': 'F9 19, that's next year. Departments will need to absorb them and there may be impacts from that. At this point, we also do not expect any surplus or new funds for one time purposes. The city is independently recognized as having very good financial management and we are always improving efficiency.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But those good aspects cannot overcome the major impacts from pension costs and slow revenue growth. Budget issues are likely to continue into the future. Most importantly, the projection does not include the impact of litigation. That impact will be discussed later in the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In summary, based on the preliminary projection, we have the very good news that we believe we can achieve a balanced budget. Balancing actions and their dollar size are key factors in addressing the preliminary shortfall projection. It is projected that we will require 11.3 million new net new balancing actions to provide a stretch structurally balanced budget.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the Budget Office has tentatively identified preliminary balancing actions that will do just that. We believe there is about $4 million and balancing actions available from fee and fine increases and parking revenues. Ambulance fees are one key area for potential revenue for many people.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These fees are often covered by some type of insurance. The current fees are below cost and below the current L.A. County rates, parking fines or another key revenue source. The current fines are below those in Los Angeles, and the city does not charge for the separate fees that the state collects.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Budget Office will also look at other fees that are not recovering costs and other fines for potential increases. We are also suggesting that an initial estimate of $900,000 may be available from transient occupancy taxes on short term rental of homes and apartments done through services such as Airbnb.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is a national issue and we are suggesting that action could be taken by city council in the near term to begin to collect that money. We are also suggesting using $3.1 million in new measure revenue and $3.9 million in a reallocation to public safety of Measure A.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have recently received information to allow us to better project the new measure A revenue. There is now strong indication that measure a revenue is better than we originally projected. In looking at that and proposing that reallocation. We want to point out that there is no adverse impact on the city's $150 million infrastructure program.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Finally, an estimated 2.9 million in other balancing actions is needed to balance the budget based on preliminary based on the preliminary projection. We believe that we can find that amount through vacancies, savings, new funding sources, additional efficiencies and other areas of cost reduction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Included in this would be finding offsets for unfunded cost increases that departments incur. Some of the additional balancing actions could have an impact on services, but we would strive to keep them to a minimum. There is a total of 14.8 billion and suggested balancing actions.'",
        "'speaker_10': '3.5 million of those were already assumed in the original budget. So there needs to be an additional 11.3 million and balance to balance the updated preliminary projection. And we have identified that $11.3 million to achieve a preliminarily balanced budget.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The actual budget shortfall and the needed balancing actions may be different from the amount shown in the preliminary projection. It is early in the year and as the year progresses and more information becomes available, there is potential for significant variance to the preliminary projection.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'For example, a 1% variance and overall revenues could mean 4 to $5 million. Updated projections may require less or more budget balancing actions, and if more budget balancing actions are needed and are not available, then department reductions may be necessary.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We expect a major projection update to be released sometime in March and then a final three year projection update will be released with the proposed budget in July. In summary, the 2019 budget is balanced based on the preliminary projection and the 11.3 million in balancing actions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Unfortunately, the preliminary budget that I have described does not take into account the impact of litigation. Litigation has a major budget impact. Litigation will result in service reductions due to a loss of long time revenues. There are two lawsuits that are issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The recently settled litigation concerning the water utility adds another $8.3 million to the budget shortfall. In addition, depending on whether the city wins or loses some gas utility litigation, it could add another $10 million to the shortfall.

        "'speaker_10': 'The charter amendment, currently being considered by City Council for Inclusion on the ballot, could prevent the service reductions due to the two lawsuits with no historical cost increases. Two Fy19 budget options will be prepared because of the uncertainty with regard to the charter amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It cannot be assumed that the charter amendment would put on the ballot or that if it is put on the ballot that it will be has. As a result. The 1419 budget process that is now underway includes the development of two budget options.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One option is with no impact from litigation. The other assumes an $8.3 million additional shortfall as a result of the water litigation settlement. Settlement of the gas litigation is expected to be about two years away. So the budget does not include that potential impact.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Whether the litigation will impact the budget will be known one way or the other before the proposed budget is completed. As soon as that is known, the appropriate option will become the basis of the FBI 19 proposed budget.'",

And we will focus on maintaining services that provide financial, technological and H.R. controls and capabilities, and will focus, of course, on strong economic development, strong financial management, and on reducing costs and increasing revenues.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to thank the city staff for their hard work in both tightening up the budget and our economic development and department for helping with our economic initiatives that have made it possible for additional revenues to come in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that since the 3:00 meeting today, when we first announced that this would be possible, we've already received some fake news tweets related to people saying that the council's overspending and how could we have a deficit? I think that they're completely misunderstanding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We. In the future, see that expenses are growing and revenues were outpacing them. And so with the partnership of my colleagues, we looked to the future and said. Winter is coming. Let's tighten up our belts now. Let's put forward the initiatives necessary to grow our business corridors, to invest in our opportunities with our revenue related to capturing'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And because of this forward thinking city staff and the support of my colleagues, we are ahead of schedule like we have never been before in terms of ensuring that we do not go into a budget process planning for a deficit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so for that, I just want to make sure that the messaging is accurate and clear. We haven't spent into a deficit. We were projecting. And then with the courage to say, we know what's coming, let's tighten our belts today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let's invest today. And let's be sure that our future is bright and that the things that the residents care about our public safety, our infrastructure, our afterschool programs are safe. Those programs are key to keeping a community vital.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you. Chair Mongeau Budget Oversight Committee Chair Mongeau. We had a conversation months ago and we literally entitled are our op ed Winters coming or something like that? And I think it's smart that, you know, we asked city staff to take a look at this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I just want to say the final financial management staff, this is the kind of kind of creativity we were asking for. I have to say, bring in two proposals to bring bringing to budget options forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's interesting. I wonder what the response of the public from the public will be. But I think it's smart to educate people on the potential risk of, you know, the potential impact of litigation, because the reality is we deal with these lawsuits all the time, and many folks don't know sort of the impact of the decisions that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we have to make here. It's smart that we're moving it moving forward with a proposal to and, you know, to maintain what we restored. I think it would be unfair to the public if we presented a budget that takes out of service the things that we just placed into service like Rescue 12, like Engine eight, like the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'South Division. And a lot of times it takes time to ramp up and really adjust our systems. So we have to make sure that we are putting our best foot forward to protect those services. I think the part about strong, strong, focused focus on strong economic development, I just want to underscore that that should be all across'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our city. So projects that are happening in all parts of our city, we should do we think, you know what I'm talking about time. We should make sure that we're doing what we can to move those projects along in all parts of our city, those economic development projects.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So again, I support this direction. Again, the angel is in the details. I do want to better understand what it looks like, sort of the details of what these savings look like. But I love the direction that we're trying our best to sort of protect and preserve the quality services that our city provides.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, so thank you. And I'll be I'll be supportive of this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I definitely want to applaud the BBC and the staff for all the work that they've done on this. I know that, you know, at the end of last budget cycle, it was a lot of conversation. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Like Winter's coming and that we are going to be dealing with a massive deficit. And so I also want to make it clear for some of my constituents that this is, in fact, a proposal from city staff, a projection of where the work is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just have a couple of clarifying questions for the revenue from short term rentals. Where did we get that number from?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That number was based on very preliminary information, very preliminary based on Airbnb and then expanding it to potential other similar type firms. A lot of work needs to be done to confirm that, and we certainly recognize that council has not taken action on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. And could somebody update us on just the RFP process and where we are with the short term rental?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, Councilmember. We have closed the RFP process. We're very close to issuing an award and we would be able to get started pretty soon. So we expect a memo out next week that we can kind of outline where we are in that process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we issued the RFP in October. We're just about done now, which is about four months. And then we're targeting for summer to be able to do the work, the outreach, and come back by summer, which would line up with this budget process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. And one of the clarifying reasons I asked is because I know in the item that we had also asked through that RFP process for the consultant to explore ways to direct some funds to affordable housing opportunities, considering the balance and the relationship in between short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just want to be clear with that as we move forward with the process that there are lots of different ways to get revenue from short term rentals, whether it's fee based or fines or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But just that that is an ambiguous number that we still have a lot of work to do. So I just wanted to recognize that. I also wanted to just say how much I appreciate the fact that we're looking across the board economic development, obviously not only in downtown but in the third District and North Long Beach is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'really critical. Adding those housing units is also super critical. And I look forward to having a community process where we talk about how we have equity in services throughout the city where everybody can be involved in this. So I'm very happy that this is coming forward earlier than planned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I already asked most of my questions during the BFC. Just as a summary for my colleagues, I did clarify that the reference to the term litigation in the presentation is referencing specific litigation, not litigation in general.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we are and are not anticipating these numbers to change dramatically just because of litigation in general, but but rather more specific litigation. So that was one of the topics I discussed, but I did not talk about short term rentals and I'm glad Councilmember Pearce raised it just in case any of my residents, especially from Naples in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the peninsula, are watching. Short term rentals are prohibited in the city of Long Beach. And I understand that. And we're not by any stretch of the imagination changing the policy by discussing this. However, and I just want to clarify, if we do take some action in terms of short term rentals, it's it's right now it's very unclear'",
        "'speaker_5': 'what that action would look like. We may choose to take action where we allow them in some parts of the city, disallow, allow them and others based on parking impacts, density, all of that. So so hopefully we're not I mean, we understand that we have a long way to go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're talking about what the fees and taxation rates will be. And in my district, I'm having the communication about whether or not we're even going to allow this. So I just want to make sure that the conversation is very clear because as Jack, my chief of staff, will tell you, we just had a very heated community meeting'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with multiple petitions going on throughout the district for the city to enforce the ban. So to put it on here as a revenue source, I think might send the wrong message to to some residents who are still hoping that we enforce the ban.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm very much looking forward to having that discussion and seeing what options are available. And hopefully our consultant will share with us what some of the best practices that have been utilized by other cities are that might alleviate some of the concerns in our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. So again, as I stated earlier, I want to thank our staff for putting this presentation together. I think it was really well done and I look forward to the update in March.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if I can add a clarification, Mr. Mayor. Yes, please. So on the short term rentals. That's absolutely correct. We're actually approaching this little differently than some other cities. Some other cities have basically accepted the money and already programed it and spent it before they've allowed it to be legal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we didn't feel that in our case that that was appropriate. We are here kind of projecting and looking to the future and saying if we were to allow it in some level, it might generate this amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And you heard the finance director say that it's very speculative of what that actual number is, but we're using that 900,000. But we have not accepted it. We are not planning on it's not in the budget yet, but it's part of our future projections.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we wanted to keep that process pure so we can discuss all of those options and come before you with a recommendation before we count on any money in our budget like some other cities have done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So sorry I forgot to ask my other question. I think I asked this last time that we discussed the budget and in regards to the litigation, but just to be clear that this is only referencing the litigation on the water and gas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So is there a line item where we estimate potential litigation for, say, PD? How do we assess that, that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We used a historical practice on that we meet with the city attorney periodically, we review the cases, we look at historical practice, and that has actually served us fairly well. If there is a deviation in any particular year, we generally can fund it over a period of time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we have not had a big problem with funding that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Since we're talking about some of the fines and fees and I know parking tickets was a component of the discussion for the $4 million, I was put on notice recently that we still have not had the RV ban come to the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to be another seven months. So perhaps we need to discuss options of implementing it outside of the coastal area, especially if we're considering revenues related to parking fines. So if parking fines and fees for individuals, parking illegal trucks and trailers and ARVs are to be considered, maybe that would be something that needs to come back'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to the council sooner rather than later if we're thinking about it being a component of revenue for next year. So that would be my comment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Seeing that is all the council comment, I want to make a couple of comments and then we'll go for any public comment. So I just want to first just add to staff. I know you guys worked really hard on getting us to this point, and I do think that what is important is that I essentially'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what we did this year and I do want to thank the BFC and other members of the council. We've had these discussions including I know a motion by I think it was Councilman Mango invited me. Richardson I think towards the end of last year in the budget cycle that we're essentially solving and eliminating the deficit before we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'even start the budget process and essentially doing it early. And so I think that's really smart. I think it is it's important that we're kind of taking these kind of budget budget balancing measures early. A lot of people don't realize that we we balance our budget every single year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so sometimes when people hear the word deficit, they don't realize that the second that we think we're going to have a deficit, we eliminate it. And when we pass our budget and I think that's something that's important that we do year after year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm really glad that with these balancing actions that essentially we eliminate the shortfall, with the exception, of course, of some of that possible legal liability that we have because of that of the utility lawsuits. But if we take these budget balancing actions and the council adopts this as a as our plan, we just we repeat'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one more time what that is what that leaves our actual deficit number at zero. Well, zero, but nodding, but not including.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The little but the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Litigation. Yeah, the litigation would add 8.3. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this would, this would separate the litigation. This would balance the budget and leave our deficit at zero. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. And then also just to just reconfirm as well, I do appreciate Mr. Modica, I know there's a lot of conversation about short term rentals. I'm really glad that we were finally out there and actually getting the work done because I think there's a lot of interest from the council and all of us to get that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'work done, including from not just members in the community that are seeing some of the some of these homes and apartments being used for nothing, but essentially the small hotels, but also from the short term rental community. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They also want us to pass a policy and they also want to be regulated. And so I think that the I'm glad that you guys selected a conservative number on that. I mean, obviously, the it's it's a small piece of kind of the larger revenue pie, which I think is smart.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I would encourage is the sooner that we have some sort of policy that kind of dictates the future, even even cities that have well, in most most cities have now or either have or are implementing, as you know, the short term rental policies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But even cities that have implemented these and certain begun collecting taxes have seen pretty substantial investments back into their funds because of these short term rental taxes. And so the fact that we're allowing these well, you know, we're not officially allowing in fact, these are being operated with no sort of direct benefit back to the city is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'problematic. And every day that we don't have a policy and collect that actual support, I think we're just losing revenue that could be invested back into our neighborhoods. So the sooner we do that, I think the better. I think everyone would like to see that done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then and then with that, I'm I'm happy to know I was not aware that the measure is coming in larger than we originally initially thought. Is that correct? So about 3.9 million more.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is. That is correct. About 3.1 million we're projecting for 8 to 18 at this point. First for the structural side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well double that for whatever little. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the totals double that, huh. Yes. So measure is coming actually in about 6 million. More than expected. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's about we think it's about 12% up. We're still looking at it, but those are what the preliminary numbers say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I love how you guys gave us those. Conservative numbers, which was good. I appreciate that. Actually, 12% is not insignificant. I mean, that is that's a good amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's very good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So. So that is. So I'm so I'm really happy. Yeah. Yeah, I'm really happy to see that measure is coming in more than expected. And again, I'm thankful to to the voters that put their trust in us to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's really, really great news. I was not aware of that. So happy to hear that. Any public comment on this? Yes. Please come forward. Join the other public comment. This will be our only speaker then and the closing public comment.'",

Already, the city of Long Beach spends less than 5% of the overall budget on positive youth development programs.'",

Our membership base and community partners are motivated to partner with this Council to ensure that we are creating effective strategies to invest in youth and make them our top priority.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The future is bright. When we invest in youth, afterschool programs do make our communities thrive, but only when investment is equitably spent across communities. Lastly, I urge this Council to not play a balancing act with the future of Long Beach children in youth.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and members of council. There's been a lot of progress with the city's Green Fleet program, and we'd like to bring you up to date. This is an update of a presentation given to the Sustainable City Commission in July.'",

Security necessary for our receipt of a $622,000 emission reduction grant. This overview gives a broad idea of the size and scope of the city's fleet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Some of the awards and recognition that we're quite proud of, about 2000 vehicles in the fleet we purchase about 200 new ones a year, go through about 2 million gallons of fuel. And we've won a couple of pretty decent awards in recognition for Green Fleet and overall fleet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As you can see, we're doing pretty well with the use of alternative fuel vehicles in the fleet. Our overall purchase rate is 50% or more of all fuel vehicles, and that's where the city's fleet is being quite varied with many vehicle types that have no fault fuel model available.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you look at what we're purchasing compared to the market availability, 98% of our fleet purchases are alternative fuel. And I'll talk more about the various fuels we use in a later slide. We've been taking an aggressive approach to greening our fleet and to making our operations more sustainable.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our Green Fleet analyst, Jackie Dimmock, sitting beside me, manages the pilot testing of new technology to reduce fuel use and emissions. And she also manages our telematics program, which I'll discuss later. Also, our program to become an accredited sustainable fleet is managed through Napa, the National Association of Fleet Administrators, the nation's largest fleet management association.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it helps guide our future sustainability efforts and policy. And Long Beach recently achieved the highest ranking Tier four among only 34 accredited fleets in the United States. Alternative fuels are generally defined as those fuels derived from sources other than petroleum when used in vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'However, natural gas, hydrogen and electricity are also included. You could look at it as anything other than gasoline and conventional diesel fuel. We've been in LPG fleet since 2003 and were pioneers in the field. We converted to renewable LPG in 2015 and LPG and CNG are used primarily in medium duty and heavy duty trucks and we are'",
        "'speaker_9': 'converting from LPG to CNG in the fleet now. We've been using CNG since the 1970s and renewable CNG starting in August of last year. Our focus on renewables has paid off as about half the fuel the city uses is renewable.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Renewable CNG is produced from biomass sources in landfills and allows us to reduce our reliance on organic petroleum sources. Renewable natural gas is also cheaper due to credits. It's about 32% less expensive. Renewable diesel brings a 50 to 90% greenhouse gas reduction over traditional diesel, plus a 9% NOx reduction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And along with these renewable fuel transitions. We recently opened a new CNG time filled station at the city's Temple Willow Yard. We open the city fleets first time field station last May. It serves up to 100 heavy duty trucks and sweepers and as mentioned, uses renewable CNG.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And since those trucks fill up overnight, it also saves time and Labor compared to LNG fueling, which must be done by an attendant. Converting to renewable CNG was a big step and we were also recently able to start using an advanced engine that further minimizes the environmental footprint of these trucks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This picture is from the Alternative Clean Transportation Expo held here in Long Beach in May of last year, where we displayed the first near zero engine refuse truck in municipal service in the United States. And this is important because the initial the emissions reductions are substantial and very significant when you consider the heavy duty cycle these trucks'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have. This new emissions reduction technology on these trucks enables considerable NOx reduction. And these reductions are important because our refuse trucks use copious amounts of fuel doing their job and they can be big polluters and harmful to residents health.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we have 23 near-zero engine trucks today and another five on the way. And while the greenhouse gas reduction is welcome, the NOx reductions is the excuse me, NOx emissions are reduced to a level 90% lower than the national EPA standard.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Overall emissions of a near-zero engine truck when using renewable natural gas are equivalent to an electric truck when measuring just the power plant emissions of that electricity. So turning to the hybrid portion of the city's fleet, the city fleet contains a number of hybrids, primarily sedans and SUVs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Benefits are not only reduce fuel use and emissions, but also less maintenance effort. There are infrastructure challenges when going to a plug in hybrid, but those come with even better gas mileage and emission reductions. We're expanding use of hybrids in the fleet with a pilot test of new technology for light trucks and vans.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For trucks and vans. Our Ford supported aftermarket up fit adds attraction motor and battery pack retains the original engine and powertrain reduces CO2 emissions by 20%, increases fuel economy by 25%, and the plug in gets a 50% mpg increase.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're excited about pilot testing of Ford's new pursuit rated hybrid police car. This will start in Long Beach in September, depending on delivery, will test five cars and patrol and unmarked service. These patrol cars are rated at 38 miles per gallon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's a savings of about $6,000 per car in fuel over its lifetime and 28 tons of greenhouse gas emissions per vehicle. Pretty excited about this PD test. As I mentioned, this is the first patrol car on the market with real potential for emissions reduction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And turning to the future, we're looking at other potential alternative fuel options. We're exploring hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and we have a pilot test of a Toyota Mirai. Thus far, we've had great performance and reliability and we're getting much more involved in the battery electric market.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Battery electric cars, as you may know, are readily available. However, trucks are not yet well developed. But this is changing fast. And I'll have more on our battery electric vehicle program in a few slides. First, I want to talk about the use of data in operating an efficient fleet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're actively moving towards a fully data driven fleet, both in maintenance and in operation. This supports and enables emissions reductions through reduced fuel usage. We collect data on the fleet through use of telematics, which is the transmission and use of vehicle data to include how and where a vehicle is driven.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We use both passive and active telematics, and some of the key data that we can obtain includes engine idling time, vehicle location, how a vehicle is driven, for example, hard acceleration or heart breaking vehicle fault codes and more.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Another initiative we're looking at is engine REPROGRAMING. That's the opposite of performance tuning, and it is essentially engine tuning for fuel economy. As we fully implement telematics across a fleet, we can begin fleet wide reporting to departments to drive decisions on how our vehicles are used and to ensure maximum efficiency and reduce emissions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And turning to battery electric vehicles. Now, earlier this year, we started a task force to develop plans to convert city vehicles from fossil fuel to electric. In May, the B.V. Task Force met for the first time to develop draft policy for battery electric vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The task force is comprised of Fleet Public Works, Office of Sustainability and Government Affairs. The policy is that Bevs will be used wherever feasible, subject to availability and with limited exemptions. Electric vehicles are more sustainable. Reducing emissions and operational cost range has greatly increased and the technology has become mature.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Battery electric vehicles are considered to be zero emissions, while only sedans are readily available. That's changing rapidly. The electric vehicle the electric vehicle field is widening, and since most of our cities fleet is trucks, we are closely following development of electric options in that segment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in terms of funding regular fleet capital charges will fund the electric cars and the charters departments are to pay electricity costs just as they do for fuel. Electric vehicles are more or less expensive to operate, but the infrastructure costs can be significant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We'll use available grant funding for the charging infrastructure, and our deployment of electric vehicles will initially focus on sedans. There are 84 eligible sedans in the fleet for conversion spread across most departments, and we're looking at vehicles such as the Chevy Bolt to Nissan Leaf.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Conversion would be phased as the current sedans age out of the fleet. Within two years, we expect to expand beyond passenger cars and move into Electric Park, sorry, electric trucks and more for the future. We intend to continue to pursue multiple strategies to reduce the city's carbon footprint.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That means fully developing our green fleet policy and being the early adopters whenever feasible and smart, acquiring the greenest possible vehicles. And it's not just vehicles. We are working hard to integrate the full spectrum of telematics and its data into management of the fleet to reduce fuel consumption and emissions while improving safety.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This necessitates policy development discussions and increased department involvement. It offers other alternatives also such as gamification and programs that grant small, non-monetary incentives for eco driving. And finally, we will stay fully tuned into the ongoing transition to autonomous vehicles and mobility.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It won't be many years until we are using autonomous vehicles for at least some of the city's transportation needs. This is an exciting time to be in the fleet business. The technology is advancing so quickly and the opportunities to not only improve service delivery but reduce our impact on the environment are significant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Indeed. That concludes my presentation on the city's Green Fleet program. Next, I have a very short presentation on clean transportation from the South Coast HQ, AMD's Mobile Sauce Reduction Committee. That presentation is necessary for our receipt of the $622,000 emissions reduction grant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's in today's council meeting. This is the clean transportation presentation from the Local Government Partnership Program. Yamazaki was established by the legislature and is working closely with the South Coast A.D. to invest in reduction in air pollution. We have significant air quality challenges, as you're aware, and according to the A.D., we are in an extreme not attainment'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for ozone, which is a primary component of smog. We have mandatory air pollution reductions that are necessary focused on NOx and NOx emissions, which need to go down by 45% within the next five years. The way that we accomplish this is through the AQ MD's plan of which our grant is a part in this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'AQ AMP is a roadmap on how to meet those obligations. We are partnering with them and with the South Coast AQ, MDA to get our funding. Participation is voluntary. However, funding has been reserved for us and we are working with Mr. SI to obtain that $622,000.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That concludes my presentation. I'm available for your questions. Very thorough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very, very thorough. Great job. No, seriously, I'm just very, very nice. Thank you very much. Any. Any. Any questions?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You have two people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know, but, councilman, did you have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No. No. Okay, I'm just looking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Andrews. I'm okay. You're okay. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You just get me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in the last year, I actually worked on a grant for different types of charging stations and thought I'd learned more about vehicles of this type than ever before. But the thoroughness of this presentation has opened my eyes to how little I know about all of this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you very much. Thank you for keeping our fleet clean. And my only question would be, I know that there have been some discussions and dialogs about the changing face of vehicles and that a lot of businesses are considering moving to a lease by the hour model where different industries are coming in and saying, instead of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'owning your own fleet and or leasing your fleet for your exclusive use that sits parked X amount of time that organizations like Enterprise and others have come out and said, we provide fleet services to cities. Have we looked into that and or is there a cost savings if you have?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, Councilmember, we do some limited leasing where it makes sense right now. We do it in the fire department on some very expensive assets there, and we've done it in another couple of examples that I can't recall right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm familiar with Enterprise's model considerably. Mm hmm. And there is money to be saved by leasing in the right cases, in the right types of vehicles, not necessarily through their model. Okay. We can generally get the money cheaper.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Right. Through bonding and so forth, which we have done. So, yes, in a nutshell, we have done that and looked at it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They had made a presentation at a conference of some sort, I guess a while back related to like animal control vehicles and how expensive they can be to build. And yet there were all these different options available when cities work together and the fleets move around and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's great to hear that you've already looked into it and it I wouldn't doubt that whatever you have to say on it would be accurate as you have more information on this matter than I've ever seen in almost any presentation at the Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So congratulations and great work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And Councilmember, I do want to point out that Dan is a true expert in this field, is an area where we're doing really innovative work throughout the entire nation. So we get lots of awards for our fleet and it's something we're very proud of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've heard those awards, but now I see why. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Dan, I hope, you know, I'm just giving you a hard time. This was actually a great presentation. So and Craig fills us in on other all the great things that are happening all the time on this. And so very exciting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's good to see all the all this just commitment to our our climate change goals and pretty amazing stuff. So thank you very much. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just a point of order. You know, two motions up there. I made the original motion kind of skipped. I just wanted to say it's all good. So did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I. That is true. I don't know why that did that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I wanted to just chime in and just say, Mr.. See, we can thank them for a lot. This is this is a grant. And a lot of times we just hit a button and don't acknowledge it. But and I'm an alternate on MSR three in this see through SAG and they've supported events like our active transportation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'event in North Palm Beach. They provided $75,000 for that. They support a lot of the work that we do to green our fleet. And so we sit we say thank you to our team for making it so easy for us to go to MRC and get these funds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we also want to recognize and just say thank you to MRC and we do appreciate the support they give to our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Councilor Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Yes, fantastic presentation. Not only the slides, but just your commentary throughout. It was very easy to follow. Thank you so very much. I did have one question. I know that there's I've had two concerns coming from my constituents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One is on the status of those companies that service the EV charging stations. Can you give us an update on where the city is with those contracts? Maybe not. Maybe that's a mr. Beck question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the what? What I know about that from in discussions on the BBVA Task Force is that a contract is being prepared or rather an RFP to get a contract to service the stations that exist already within the city for public use.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that would also include the stations that we are proposing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'll add a little bit to that. So we had put those in. Those are especially going in in the beach areas and a new lots. That's part of our policy. Unfortunately, nationwide, one of the major leaders of that service went bankrupt.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we had to cancel all of our contracts, figure out a way to get the power turned back on while we go back out and do an RFP. So it we asked for a little bit of patients were kind of in a new field here trying to make that work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. And then I also just want to highlight, you know, as a city how many awards we've gotten, but just the fact that we're we talk about being green, we talk about climate change to be able to have a fleet so diverse as this, I think is really amazing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I hope that we share it with our constituents and our residents. So I hope this presentation is somewhere available for them so that they can be proud of the work that we do in-house. And then my other question is, outside of the city, I know we've had constituents call and ask about getting service stations near their'",
        "'speaker_6': 'home or at their home. Could you just for the public, a recap what that processes?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we actually do have a program for free chargers. So it's something that really only exists in Long Beach that we know of right now. We, through our partnership with Mercedes-Benz, when they came here and became their Western regional headquarters, they gave us I don't remember the number, but I think several thousand chargers.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we are offering those free to the public. They do have to come in and get a building permit in order to install it safely. But if anyone's interested, we have that on our website and we can make that available so we still have chargers left to give.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Any public comment on this? CNN. Mr. Bolen, do you have one? Please come down.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Give me a minute. I'll be right there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, Larry, Will and I have a real interest in this is really going the meeting after the events was the compliance manager for Toyota motor sales for many years so involved in the early days of emissions regarding zero emissions electric vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is a question to the director. What percentage of the kilowatt hours that you purchase from, I believe Edison, are generated by coal fired generating plants outside of California. As a question. No answer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you know, Mr. Bowen, this is an opportunity to ask questions per se. But if council only we can. But continue with your public comment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I suppose a friendly time. The reason I ask that question that maybe the public might get fooled a little bit when it says zero emissions because Edison does buy power from four corners from the Navajos. And I don't know, but I think it's a fairly larger.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Content of coal fired energy that we get. So remember that it may not be zero. There may be some other number. Thank you.'"
