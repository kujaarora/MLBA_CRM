        "'speaker_1': 'JOHNSON Well, thank you, Mayor, and I think Councilmember Sugimoto for co-sponsoring this with me. She's certainly very knowledgeable on water issues that are represented for the MWD. As everyone knows, the governor has declared a drought, and while there's no immediate crisis here in Southern California, I thought would be a good idea to revisit our conservation efforts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As David Freeman said many years ago. We do basic get out of the concept of drought. We have a long term challenge where supplies are threatened and demand continues to increase, or at least the demand is not sufficiently addressed by supply.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that's what we need to look at. But certainly I want to respect the governor's call and revisit what we can do. I did talk to the chair of the water board, Harry Saul Shaver, who mentioned that they would be discussing this at a future board meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And certainly we don't want to preempt anything they're discussing since it is the water board who is in control. But I do invite the water department to come out and address the subject and thank them for their advocacy on this issue.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much for this opportunity to talk to you about water conservation here in the city of Long Beach. Our supply reliability in Long Beach really relies on a number of different things, and one of the most important is water conservation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm appreciate this opportunity. There's really two aspects to water conservation. One is sort of behavior. It's sort of choosing not to hose down the driveway. Choosing not to let the faucet run while you're brushing your teeth or shaving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Choosing not to take a 20 or 30 minute shower. All of this these choices really matter. In the end, they add up the lot. What I'm going to talk to you tonight about, though, are the programs that we have available for the people in the businesses of Long Beach, specifically our rebate programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have a lot of programs for our business customers. We call it CEA, commercial, industrial and institutional. And then, of course, are important residential customers. And we manage these programs through a partnership with the Regional Wholesale Water Agency, the Metropolitan Water District.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have the websites up there. They're both very good sites that provide a tremendous amount of information in all these programs. I'm going to talk about this, just the legal caveat. They're all subject to change and there's limits of time and funding and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But first, with our commercial, industrial and institutional customers for landscape irrigation, we provide $4 for very efficient water irrigation nozzles for public agencies like the city of Long Beach. It's a special $6 per nozzle. We have $13 rebates for large nozzles, $30 per station for the smart irrigation controllers that just themselves automatically.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for public agencies like the school district in the city, it's a $45 per station, which is a tremendous amount of money and something called an INS Tim Flow regulator to minimize excess irrigation for restrooms for our commercial industrial institutional customers, for control valves to limit the amount of water per minute that's coming through the faucet, but'",
        "'speaker_0': 'keeps the high pressure, $220 per urinal. And for fitness centers, it's an incredible 510, which is almost the cost of the device itself and for toilets, 110 for fitness centers, 310, again, a special program, really encouraging fitness centers to make these conversions are coin operated laundries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a lot of them here in Long Beach. We have, again, another really incredible deal, $500 for the high efficiency clothes washers. It covers about a third of the cost of the device cooling towers. It's basically like the air conditioning on large buildings an office building can use.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Half of its water can be used just for the cooling towers. There's 200 or $2,050 in rebates for one kind of device, $725 for another kind of device to help bring efficiency to these devices that consume tremendous amounts of water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Commercial kitchens, thousand $50 for air cooled ice making machines, $585 for connection US food steamers, turf replacement $3 a square foot of irrigated with potable water, $2 if you're engaged with recycled water. And then finally, if that's not enough, we understand that to conserve and the commercial industrial sector can be very difficult.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're all very, very different from one another. So we've even created sort of a catch all program if there's any way that they can figure out to conserve water, whether it's to change a process, to buy new equipment, whatever it might be, we'll bring some money to the table to help them do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is, again, a very innovative program, and we're the first one of the first cities in Southern California to actually have this kind of a program, and now it's region wide. So we're very proud of the fact that we're pioneers in one more water conservation program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now for the residential customers, of course, we have a lot of programs for them as well. $175 rebate for a high efficiency clothes washer. $50 rebate for the high efficiency toilets. $4. These are these incredibly water efficient sprinkler nozzles, rain barrel rebates.'",
        "'speaker_0': '$80 for these smart controllers, self-adjusting irrigation controllers in our line to garden program. Our line to garden program. We provide $3 a square foot maximum of 1000 square feet for a single family home to replace grass in the front yard and parkway with a beautiful landscape that thrives naturally in our semi-arid region.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These landscapes require about only 20% of the water of a grass lawn. And there's the website. This is a very user friendly program you can apply online. We have free classes about how to convert your landscape. We have photographs of over a thousand Long Beach homes that have done the conversion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you can see pre and post photographs of other homes in your neighborhood. Virtual tours, the beautiful landscapes. We have online plant databases to databases. They each have about 1500 different kinds of species of plants. We have free landscape designs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a deal with a 15% discount at certain nurseries in Long Beach area for people who go through the program to buy you plan material and much, much more. And this is an award winning program, and we're pleased to announce that we received our most recent award less than a week ago from a statewide water organization'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And these are the kind of landscapes that we're talking about. We're not talking about putting gravel down and getting rid of the grass and creating an unsightly landscape. It's really we're talking about lawn to garden. So these are all very drought tolerant plants that you see, and this is in the spring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're blooming like crazy. It's very gorgeous landscape, but we have a lot of other programs to promote sustainable landscapes. And one of the reasons for this is that about half of the water used at the typical single family home is used outdoors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is really important to us. That's why we have this emphasis on landscape. We have free landscape classes and they've been going on for years and tremendous interest in our community. For these customers, it's going to apply online.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have our free watering update will soon give us you give us your email address and will notify you when it's time to change your irrigation. Turn it up, turn it down. Depending on the weather, that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a tour of spring tours. It's free to our customers. And last year we had 1900 reservations, people in Long Beach to go on this tour to tour. They tour over 30 beautiful homes in Long Beach. And I want to make a shameless plug right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's time to sign up to register for. This will be our third garden tour. We'll have again about 30 homes in Long Beach, beautiful landscapes. You go there, see the landscape, get a plan. Let's talk to the homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They answer whatever questions you have and they're all very excited about their landscapes. And actually their excitement is really contagious. We encourage people to register and by registering, then you get the updates, you get the maps, you get all that stuff sent to you automatically, to your smartphone, to your email, wherever you want it sent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's really easy to register. You can just do it online. And that's my presentation. Be happy to answer whatever questions you have about our conservation program and our rebates.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Lowenthal I don't have any questions, but I wanted to thank you for your presentation. I think it's timely. Also like to thank Councilmember Johnson for this item. As you mentioned, that the drought declaration certainly brought a great deal of statewide attention to this subject and the challenges facing Californians in the San Joaquin Valley and Delta area'",
        "'speaker_8': '. You know, I do want to caution us, and I think both Kevin and Matt have alluded to this. Every city and every region is different. While this is a statewide problem and there are no geographic boundaries or political boundaries to our groundwater and really just water in general, we have done a tremendous job here and we need'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to continue to do so. And I think if residents stay the course, then we could see our way through this. But I certainly don't want to send a negative message that somehow our residents here have not for at least the last decade done just as we had hoped and hope that we continue to do so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, we do want to also reach and force the notion that while a lot of us have embraced conservation, there is always more that can be done, even small ways, household appliances, things that are something that we things that we take for granted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So those big and small ways do tend to add up. And single family owners, homeowners, primarily when you do your lawn to garden program, you can see how the old notion of converting your lawn to something that is water conserving doesn't have to be barren or desert like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so you've been able to demonstrate that. And I and I think it's a better approach to approach homeowners in a way that they can still meet their esthetic needs and curb appeal. We're always taught about curb appeal when when we become homeowners or even renting a home.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I appreciate that you've taken that approach. I want to compliment the water department for hanging in there with the tiered billing system. It is long in the making. We are. I want to say I brought that item forward five years ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do you recall I think it was initially five or six years ago, we researched it. Finally are at a stage where you can implement this tiered billing system and that too will help with conservation. And so really I just want to compliment the staff at the water department as well as our residents and ask that we keep'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's a membership fee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. Mayor, I want to thank both Matt and Kevin for the work that you do. And as you know, I've been sending you some emails because my constituents are extremely engaged. I'm wondering if the department can help, maybe put something out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These are wonderful. But there are some confusion among consumers as to, you know, the announcement by the governor about the drought. And then, as you know, they've indicated, well, we see the city having the sprinklers on in the medians.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, we see the the sprinklers on in the parks, etc.. What is the city doing specifically about the drought? So I'm wondering if we could get something that can get out to the consumers that were acknowledging the drought.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as Councilwoman Lowenthal indicated, that the city has done an incredible job, not only the city, but the residents have an incredible job and conservation. But that needs to continue because as I'm out there, I see a lot of people still watering a lot, watering cars, having a lot of runoff into the street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I think there's some consumer confusion out there. Maybe you all could help and get something out to the consumers. Appreciate it. Thank you for the good job you're doing. This is really excellent.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Very good, because the address you just heard from the manager of the water department. Highly qualified, talented. It's confirmed the governor has declared a state of emergency and a drought. Even though at this point we're not that much affected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would remind you again what is coming forward on the Ides of March or around that period of time? It makes absolutely no sense. Or you should see have detailed outline of how much water you have available to grow the marijuana.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's bad enough the conditions are in the view of some in some cities where it's going down the toilet and we won't have enough to flush that toilet. And I'm very serious about that. It goes back to the issue.'",

Terrific report. Exciting information opportunities for people in all all walks of life to save water and conserve water.'",

But I've been to public meetings and talking in small groups and at other associations that I'm a member of.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Everybody's conserving. We're going to continue to conserve. Conservation will improve, but where will the water come from? And we just don't know. It makes some people think that maybe instead of a rebate, there should be a surcharge for adding water usage to the cities.'",

The microbrew industry has become a a small cottage industry that's grown quite successful in areas, particularly in San Diego and others. We actually have three microbreweries in Long Beach. Those are would be Beachwood Barbecue, BBC, as well as Rock Bottom, which are the only three that are currently located here'",
        "'speaker_11': '. This has been an industry that is seeing really great growth and its microbreweries are a lot for a lot of us. It's kind of like the wine tasting of of restaurants and places to go to. It's a it's a great business.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's really about tasting different craft brews. And for a lot of people, it's more than just a hobby, but something they really enjoy doing with friends and family and others. What we currently have right now in Long Beach is where I, myself and others have been approached.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know by a couple of different businesses that are looking at production. There have been some questions about where they can and can't locate and how supportive the city is. From what I hear from the current tenants, particularly Beach, where we've been very supportive of them in the past and they've had a very good, good experience with'",
        "'speaker_11': 'what the item is asking for essentially is for us to look at what best practices are. Both Torrance and San Diego have passed pretty comprehensive policies on microbrewery, and the craft beer industry in San Diego has gone as far as to create really a whole kind of marketing and other types of campaigns to kind of bring some'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of that business to their city. So I'd be just interested to know what other communities are doing. It's been quite large for visitors and tourists. There's a lot of local economic impact that happens around these types of businesses, and so that's really what the agenda item is about.'",

They have been a wonderful catalyst for the promenade area, really, in helping put Long Beach on the Kraft Brew industry map.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I know that their next business venture is going to energize the craft brew community here in Long Beach and beyond. So we're looking forward to that. With redevelopment gone, our options for incentivizing are reduced. However, I am interested in this growing industry beyond Beechwood, so I'll be curious to see what types of zoning or piece specific'",
        "'speaker_8': 'changes could support the nano breweries that wish to set up storefronts in urban downtowns like Long Beach, the vice mayor's mentioned Torrance and other communities that have actually been able to put themselves on the map and in very micro brewing ways.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd be interested in knowing whether there are changes in our permitting that could assist medium sized breweries. Perhaps this might be more of a manufacturing question for the city manager and council to discuss down the road, but I certainly look forward to hearing back with that.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And as the vice mayor said, San Diego's already bought quite a bit of dollars, their regional economy with these establishments and also very large sales tax dollars. So with the look for supporting it and look forward to go some of these establishments in the future.'",

Thank you, city council members, for bringing this item up. I love the city. Being the brewer at the Belmont Brewing Company is the greatest job in my life.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a real job. You know, people sometimes think, oh, you're the brewer. What do you do? You go push a button and all the beer comes out and you get to sit around and drink all day. No, my day today started at 4 a.m..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, 330, my alarm went off, you know, and I rode my bike down Vista Boulevard. Thank you very much for Vista and for being a bike friendly city. I went to the Belmont Brewing Company. I brewed 200 gallons of beer today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After that, I went for a nice swim in the new pool. Thank you so much. It's beautiful. After that, I took the city bus to Beachwood Barbecue and I walked down the beautiful promenade. It's fabulous. It's fabulous. And these entrepreneurs that have put these businesses on that street should be thanked and the city should be thanked for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fixing that promenade up to be so nice and so beautiful. I love the city, the Belmont Brewing Company. I don't know how many of you remember that was a blighted area. That was a blighted area before David Hanson bought that property and turned it into that nice place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we got a nice little restaurant row there with Gypsy's Diner. And so I want to you I just want to encourage you to.

        "'speaker_5': 'You need to introduce yourself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, of course. My name is Thomas Ricardo. I'm the head brewer at Rock Bottom Brewery, just around the corner there. I'm new to the city. I've only been here for about a year and a half now, but I've seen good things in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I actually came from San Diego, which is why I wanted to come today and talk to you a little bit about this and recommend approving this as a movement. Essentially, crack beer is a great foundation for businesses of all types.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The most unique business I've heard recently coming out of San Diego was a Revolutionary War museum that serves exclusively craft beer and wants to become a craft beer destination. And I think that example is really important because it actually shows the foundation, the backbone that craft beer builds on businesses in San Diego.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Almost anything is viable. If craft beer is your base, people will show up for it. People are getting excited about it and it's only growing. I'd also like to point out how well the LBA did with their first beer festival, the Promenade Beer Festival, that brought a lot of attention to downtown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They did a really great job and the promenade was shown off to, you know, hundreds of people because of that. Yeah. And that's that's pretty much it. La la is a very untapped resource. And Long Beach is sort of the shining light outside of Torrance right now for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we'd like to continue that support and we thank you for what you've done so far.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Go, Giants Vice Mayor Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Well, first, I want to thank I want to thank all of you for coming out. And you're I mean, you guys are the pioneers of this movement in Long Beach. I think it's it's good to know, you know, what's happened in San Diego and and a few other places.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And right now, San Diego is certainly becoming like the Napa of of of the whole craft beer movement. And people literally are going out and spending time there just to visit these different breweries and spending lots of dollars throughout this throughout the county of San Diego.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's been happened also incredibly fast, at least the last you know, the last growth has been incredibly fast. So I think Long Beach with with our weather and our location and the three great breweries that we have already in place is a great foundation for this type of of industry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I just think, you know, thank all of you for the work you do. These are also these these places provide good jobs. These are really good jobs that are careers and look forward to getting back the report and how we can facilitate more of this.'",

    "Motion to Suspend Contract of Arup North American Limited.": [
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I to make clear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I made this communication for the office. Councilwoman Jeri ships key with recommendation to buy motion of the city council directed the city manager to suspend the contract of North American Limited until the next City Council and Mayor Assume office in July 2014 as membership.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I bring this issue forward because in talking with numerous residents all throughout the city of Long Beach, many question the the wisdom of pushing through any kind of project that is going to financially obligate the next city council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If this council recalls, we had to deal with the pension spiking that was left to the city council. And this is not something I think a new council, particularly this the first time in the history of Long Beach, you're going to have five new members of the council, possibly six to be handed something that was generated from'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this council. So I understand from the city attorney, Mr. Anthony, that, in fact, that the city could direct the city manager to suspend the contract until the new city council comes in so that they can take it up from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their council memberships. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And the other reason I bring this up is because as we talk to talk to residents out there, they're they're asking about the city expending $1,000,000 at a time that police officers and I've shared this with the chief and others are telling my constituents and others that we don't have enough officers on the street, that when'",
        "'speaker_9': 'we had a fire the other day, that we didn't have an engine directly available across the street and that we don't have engines in two other stations as well. And so I think it's very difficult to explain to them that the city would expand $1,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did read the new management memo, which I find very interesting, because I actually kept I keep everything. I kept the 26 and the 27 report to us. And I I would ask, though, that there was a request from city management at that time that two things be done based upon the seismic concerns.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And one of them was to evaluate, evaluate emergency response plans for occupants of this building to ensure personal safety. I know we've had some kind of discussion, but I've never seen in writing what it is that we plan on do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because if we do in fact believe this is an unsafe building, that should be the first thing we do. And the second thing was to develop mitigation strategies to address the problems with the wings and the second floor truss.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so before I make my motion, I if I can, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to ask city management if we have those two things in place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I was going to ask them to respond in general. So, Miss Frick, I'll turn it over to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly, we did all that during. We did everything there from the reports that we had from 2005 and 2006. And then, of course, when we did the peer review as requests for the city council, things got a little bit worse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm going to turn it over to Suzanne Frick to walk us excuse.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Me now and specifically, Mr. Mayor, if I can, and I hope that you answer this, those two specific steps. I know you did the peer review. I know we had a tier two study. We did not have an RFP on the cost to retrofit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I'm particularly concerned that if, in fact, we do believe this building is unsafe, did we do these two particular things that you brought to our attention on May 15, 2007, when Christina Anderson was the director of Public Works?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor Members of the Council. Yes. In fact, we did do those items at that time, as you recall. The vulnerability with this building were in the wings and that there was fear that the the wings were potentially unstable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that contains our elevator shafts, our stairwells and restrooms. And so, in essence, what we did was a major undertaking within City Hall to move all of our emergency supplies that used to be stored in those wings into the middle of the building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We informed our employees about evacuation techniques, and we also worked with the fire department to determine what would be the best method to evacuate this building in the event that our stairwells and elevator shafts were unusable. There were some challenges with the floors above the seventh floor that we still were working out the specifics.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then subsequent to that, as you recall, the Council directed us to prepare that peer review of the seismic analysis. And that peer review has determined that it is no longer just about the wings. It is now about the core of the building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that we are a. Finally on notice as of the fall that this building has some serious seismic vulnerabilities and could jeopardize the life and safety of the employees and the visitors in this building. That is what's prompting us to move forward at this point in time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I would indicate is that we have evaluated the issue of retrofit versus is new construction. And I want to kind of remind the council to some degree that the retrofitting option basically requires us to go to the voters for a bond measure because there is no funding for a retrofit, whether it is 100 million, 200 million'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or 250 million. We don't have that funding. So not only would we be paying the 10 million we're paying today, we could be paying up to an additional 16 million for a bond measure for retrofitting. And what the council has been clear about is that you do not want to fix city hall on the backs of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'taxpayer, that what you have directed us to do is try to develop a scenario that, in fact stays within the amount of money that we're currently spending. And what we're doing is moving forward with the public private partnership because that meets that objective, that there would not be a additional cost beyond what we're paying today to build'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a new city hall. So that's the dilemma that we're faced with and that's why we're moving forward. I'd also note that what we're doing right now is merely testing the market to determine whether or not the notion of this public private partnership and staying within the amount of money we spend today is feasible in the private market'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And that's what this RFP is doing. Once we determine it is or is not feasible, if it's feasible, great, we'll have a partner. Then we embark upon our public process to vision city hall and figure out what the configuration and the design is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there will be an extensive public process if it is not feasible to stay within our means. We're going to have to come back to the council and then we will have to discuss the option of going out to a bond to deal with this issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I appreciate that. A couple of if I can, Mr. Mayor, a couple follow up questions. One is that I think residents are asking why it takes $1,000,000 to find out if there's a market for this, since there obviously is a market out there because we have a building across the street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The P3 or the P3 law expires in 2017 statewide. So it needs to be obviously renewed. But we know that there that there is a market out there. So the million dollars is, I think, the bigger question. The second question is, and I and as somebody who has worked diligently in the city to try to get residents'",
        "'speaker_9': 'ready for an earthquake, if, in fact and I do believe that we have a seismic problem here. When are we think heating this building? Because the scenarios that I've been given all the time in the handout is that tomorrow, Calgary, that they are it will take best case scenario to do a development five years from the time'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that you get your proposals. Seven years is realistic according to your slide presentation. In ten years, if in fact this is in the condition in a seismically and safe. And as you say, Suzanne, the city has been put on notice.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Why aren't we? Why aren't we backing up a little bit and making plans to relocate staff and get them out of this building instead of waiting to go through a consultant process and go through the machinations and waiting for a new council to come out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, you know, I'm being I'm being sincere. I'm not you know, I'm trying to get. If you really do think this place is and you keep saying we've been put on notice, then why would we keep people here from for four or five years or even two years more?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We believe we need to move expeditiously, and that is why we're proceeding down the path where we're going down with the council support and we're engaging the council every step of the way. It is a risk that we are taking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no question about that. That's why we want to continue on an expedited process to relocate. City Hall is going to be a tremendous expense, and that may in fact, be an option that we're going to have to explore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If when these we go out with the RFP and the proposals come back, and if the scenario is that nobody can deliver us what we're asking for, we may in fact be before the city council asking you to spend money to relocate the employees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It seems to me we don't know that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. It might be prudent that you work on parallel. Tracks if, in fact, you know, this is going to take until July to come back to Stephen to discuss the feasibility of whether this is feasible. It seems to me that it would be in the best interests of the people who work here, that we are proceeding on'",
        "'speaker_9': 'some way to plan to get people out of here. The poll was closed down because it was considered to be seismically unsafe. And because you do have crowds there and they you didn't want to have any difficulties. I would think that if this is in the same and I saw the film, it's called the FCI score on'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this, if in fact, this truly is is in the state that you're saying, then I'm wondering why we would keep open and risk the same thing that might happen at a pool structure that might happen here. And I understand because of the pool in the earth.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But again, if if this is considered to be so seismically unsafe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me jump at the Belmont Pool. And the condition of city hall are two completely different scenarios. The Belmont Pool is on basically quicksand and is a 5.0 earthquake could topple that building. So that's what necessitated the immediate evacuation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City Hall, on the other hand, has some seismic vulnerabilities. We are taking a risk, but it is a calculated risk at this point in time. And so we don't believe that it is such a risk that necessitates the immediate evacuation of this building.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, what timeframe do you think they. We have to evacuate people, because by your own report, you put this city hall on fault areas. That's what you handed out to council, saying it, showing the city hall being in a Long Beach area fault.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think we've said that city hall is on a fault. The Southern California is peppered with faults and that this particular building is not in a fault.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, perhaps that was the error of the former public works director because she has it. And the city hall seismic evaluation pointing out our vulnerability because of the fault. So I don't know why that was in there if we're not at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think it's the proximity of the faults. Just we've got the newport-inglewood, we've got the Palos Verdes, we've got a number of faults that are directly connected to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, personally, I you know, I'd like to hear some more from the public, too, but I really would hope that instead of spending the money to find out if the market's out there and by the way, was the newspaper correct that if people answered this RFP, that the city will be financially obligated to pay them for answering'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it? Or was Mr. Bradley incorrect because he put that in his table?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When this matter was brought before the council, we there was a discussion about a stipend for the developer teams and that stipend would be paid by the winning developer. So that in essence the council authorized 500,000 per up to 500, let me say it that way for up to 500,000 per development team that would be payable by'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the winning proposal. Now if in fact the Council does not choose, we get the proposals in, there's a viable proposal, the council decides not to proceed. Then there is a remote possibility that the city would have to pay that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we believe if in fact this is successful and we find a developer who can deliver this, then the city will not be paying the 1.5.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the city would be obligated according because we certainly haven't we don't get to see the RFP before you send it out. So I don't know what the language is, but my understanding now is that the city would be oddly so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The future council would be obligated to pay the winning development team if in fact it chooses not to go forth at that point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not following the question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, are they going to get paid whether or not the city decides what if the city does what this news council decides in July? I know they don't want to do this. And you've picked a winning proposal that you've brought to city council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What happens with the obligation in the RFP to pay the winning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Team.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Council memberships? The current posture is that if the city issues an RFP and cancels the RFP before the submittals are required to be received, then no stipend is payable. If the RFP continues and we receive submittals from the three short bidders, those submittals that are qualified under the requirements of the RFP would then be eligible for a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'statement. If we are unable to come to an agreement with the preferred proposer, then there is a possibility the city would be responsible for the or for the stipend. But if we proceed to closing with the preferred proposer, then the preferred proposer will pay the stipend.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Mr. Conway, if the city chooses, not after they've done. Can you tell me what the maximum obligation of the city would be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we would be currently liable up to a half a million dollars per bidder if we received three qualified bids as a result of the response to the RFP.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So potentially, if the next council decides not to go forth and you had responsive bidders, it could be 1.5 million that the city would have to pay for them. Taking the time to respond.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That could be an outcome.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'd hold off on a motion until we hear more from my colleagues and from the public.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilor Longo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's okay, Mr. Mayor. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You passed?'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Process, we suspend identifying our potential solution. Is that really where you're coming from?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's precisely where we're coming from.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Correct. Because we don't know that a new building or a three piece is the solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a search.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is an investigation. Am I correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what about speaking specifically to the retrofit option?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know the $160 Million number has been thrown out. How hard is that number?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What experts have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Looked at it? How confident are you that that is the number? Should we be doing something now that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Might put us on a dual track where we want to look.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At a retrofit?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember O'Donnell The original estimate for the retrofit, including both code required and ADA, required upgrades for temporary relocation space, for soft costs, for design, for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Back in 2006 was estimated by the same engineering firm that conducted the Tier one and Tier two study.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And at that time, in 2006, the estimate was $119 million. For discussion purposes, we brought that number forward to 2013 at a 5% annual increase, which brought us to the 100 and I think $74 million range. I think Ms..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Frick's comment that the order of magnitude of that retrofit clearly makes that an unacceptable alternative for us, as we don't have anything near 100 to $200 million to focus on a retrofit that would simply saddle the residents of Long Beach with additional debt and continue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I to get the debt part. So I'm just more I just want to be confident that we've really looked at the retrofit component comprehensively. Listen, I'm not in favor of stopping tonight's stopping the process from moving forward. I just wonder, you know, is there something we should look at?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did this $160 million proposal estimate, did that undergo peer review?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember O'Donnell I don't believe that went under peer review, but it was conducted by a structural engineer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And council member. What we anticipate is that that is likely on the low end of the retrofitting costs, because, again, that was based upon the retrofitting associated with the wings, the the Tier one and Tier two analysis. And given the new analysis that's been done that is related to the core of the building, we recognize there will'",
        "'speaker_4': 'likely be additional retrofitting that would be triggered. So that's why we're saying it. If it's 160 million or if it's 200 million, that is a significant burden that we would be looking to fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But I guess what I'm telling you is what I want to be.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Confident is that the number is 160 million. That that's where.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are very confident on the low end of the number that in fact, that 160 million is the minimum amount that it would cost to retrofit. We, in fact, believe it could likely be more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Can you can you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If I could jump in, since 2006, there have been significant changes to both the building code and the seismic requirements.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And every year there will be I get it. The minute you know, you're after your buildings built, it's out of code because the code changes. So I get that. That doesn't mean that there's not a significant problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I understand it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you put something.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Together for me so that I can be confident that we've really looked at the retrofit concept and it's just not viable?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, we can put together what a viable estimate for the potential retrofit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And if you have to consult with somebody and it costs you a little bit of money, to me, that's not, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, made out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of reason.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So by all means, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's remember Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think my buttons broken. I'm not cued up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm really sorry. Your button's broken. We'll try to. We'll try to rectify that. So you do not want to be calling?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. All right. Do we have a motion here?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's go to public comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not without a motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, maybe. Maybe city management.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can help here. Listen, I'm not interested in stopping the process here this evening. I want to move forward. I do want to get something back from you that speaks to the effort that has gone into identifying the potential retrofit costs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I don't know if we'd have to do a receiver file here or or the motion would be just ask city management to to further analyze the costs associated with the potential retrofit and get back to council. I know it's through a memo or what.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's just that work for you?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember We're more than willing to return to council with an estimate on the retrofit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there's a motion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's a motion and a second council. Boston.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I'd like to piggyback on Councilmember O'Donnell's motion and possibly offer a substitute, because from what I've heard here, and I do understand that we are looking at the feasibility of this public private partnership for a new civic center.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But and I do agree that we need to also be on a parallel track with the looking at the retrofit option. But have we discussed a public private partnership for a retrofit? Is that a possibility in any way, shape or form?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think one of the public speakers mentioned that a little earlier. And the notion that we need to look at.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember a public private partnership for retrofit would still. Let's assume it's $100 million or $150 million. It would still require an additional annual payment above our existing $10.8 million. And and that would require additional funding through some source, whether it be the residents from a bond measure or taking other funds from other necessary programs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I don't know if that's a viable alternative. We have to take the existing annual expense that we have for this civic center and put it into another civic center instead of adding on to costs of the existing civic center.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we have a significant footprint here where we are today. We have a old courthouse. We have successor agency properties downtown that could be identified as a new potentially new civic center. A new civic center. I think there are.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just don't think we've looked at all of the the options and variables. But I also wanted to comment on the the the original motion. I'm not interested in the new council having an opportunity. I will just say I disagree.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think the new council won't get a pass on this issue. The new council that will be seated in July will have to deal with this issue and wrestle with this issue issue. And it will be a priority for us to wrestle with because of the seismic safety issues that have been outlined here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I do agree we need to move forward. I just think we need to look at move forward with every option available. I think we need to have a little bit more of a robust public outreach as well to meetings, in my opinion, just stating the case that it's not enough, not when you look at an'",
        "'speaker_10': 'investment with the gravity that we are going to undergo with the new civic center or retrofit. Either way, the public needs to be more engaged, more involved. And it was noted that nobody showed up to the the last meeting, a public meeting, or it was that attendance was likely it was light.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I personally had a district events and big district events going on and that conflicted with that. And so there are a lot of activities going on here in the city. And so with that said, I think we should really do more to to to do outreaching and give the public more of an opportunity to be involved.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'd be really interested in hearing about feedback. What was the public input during those public meetings regarding? The new civic center. Is there any, you know, quantifiable data? Were there surveys? Where was the online outreach and what were the results?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, I would love to get that as well. So with that, I think I'm going to support the motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember Shipp, Skip.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think Mr. Austin has a good point, that one of the things that this council has not done, we've not really had a thorough discussion about all the options, including simply relocating. And we also have not seen whether or not what the options are out there about selling the courthouse property to use to finance it for any'",
        "'speaker_9': 'kind of retrofit or any improvements for a civic center. We've just really not have that discussion. And in looking at the well, the RFQ, that didn't seem to be something that was even entertained. Any discussion about retrofitting is also not in there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So none none of the three qualifying groups actually put in any kind of proposal for qualifications for retrofit. And so we really haven't looked at the other scenarios and we really haven't had a full council meeting on the financing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know you talk about the voters would have to approve a bond, but we've not even talked about why that would be required and what aspect of this whole proposal would require that to be done versus going the P3 route.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's I think that's the other thing. The public is kind of responding to Mr. Austin, that there's they're saying that they don't think enough information has been given to the public. You're asking the public to come out and talk about something that's an extremely kind of amorphous situation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And unless you give them the information, they they really can't engage and they're not being asked to. As we have had in visioning sessions and others, they're not being asked to put things on paper. They're asked to be they're being asked verbally, you know, what do you think we should do?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, you know, that's that's an extremely vague question. And so the answers are extremely vague as well. I will tell you about the notification on the the public meetings. I had a response from a member of press saying that they were only told two days before the those the first public hearing actually took place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that makes it difficult to to get those announcements out in the press. So I would hope in this the motion that Mr. O'Donnell made and I second it, that we will get I would ask if city management give a little bit more information not only about the cost to retrofit, but how would such retrofit be financed'",
        "'speaker_9': '? Because I don't know that we've had that discussion. And could that include selling the courthouse to be able to finance such retrofitting? Because certainly we don't want to increase taxes on anyone and obligations, but we've never really had any of that discussion about how else we could pay for the retrofitting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I do know that there are FEMA, there are FEMA funds available to many of the cities that have undergone retrofitting. There's there's city halls have have received some assistance from FEMA to do that. So but in those cases, I do believe it's because FEMA indicated there city halls were called essential facilities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They had emergency communications facilities in those facilities. And we don't. So I don't I don't know that we would probably qualify on that basis. So I would just hope we get that additional information. When you're talking back to us about retrofitting, how such retrofitting could be possibly financed, that would it would help.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Otherwise, we're just we get the information and then we've had no information back about how we'd go ahead and pay for it if we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Vice Mayor, I just for the record, like to clarify what the exact motion is, as my notes indicate that it's a request for a report on the retrofit costs and then councilmember ships key is has made some additional changes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know if that's a friendly amendment or if so fall to the body.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because we're ships.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I guess my only I just wonder if you're getting ahead of us here because I mean if the retrofit is so expensive, the cost benefit isn't going to be there to retrofit because then you then you'd had the direction of a new building.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So well, because we want to know what the what has gone on with regard to researching the retrofit. Alternative. That's that's purely my motive and what the costs might be. So, you know, they had some information in there about how we might finance it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I guess that's fine, too, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So they're going to motion in a second on that counts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then I like to offer a friendly amendment to include the public the the exploring the public private partnership with the retrofit auction as well if.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that's part of the I that will be part of the moonshot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we can include that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As part of the financing component. Yeah. Okay. I just want to be clear. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's a there's a motion on the floor. I'm going to make a couple of comments. We're going to put up to the public. I think what's important for us to note is at least, at least for me, is at the end of the day, this starts and begins.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, this starts and ends as a public safety issue. And I think what's important for us to remember is I think everyone is interested, no matter what side of the issue you're on, is that we do have serious issues with this building, with the structure of the building and the safety of the people that are in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'this building should always be our top priority. And so I want to make sure that we are that that is what the debate is revolved around. There's different ways of getting getting there and creating a safer environment for our employees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that certainly needs to be at the forefront of our discussion. And also briefly, it's my understanding that. Mr.. Mr. West. From conversation that you and I had about the community outreach process is that there is going to be additional meetings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There continues to be additional needs right now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because I think that that's I mean, I think that there's been that something that I have heard in the community, I think that's important for us to make sure that we get out there if we have even that schedule.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, the sooner that we let the public know when these meetings are and they certainly should be throughout the city, I think that's going to be important so that people can ask the questions. And I mean, I think for a lot of people, this is probably instructive as well to just get information out there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so the more of those community meetings that we have, the better. And and lastly, on the visioning piece, and I just want to clarify this as well, it's my understanding that there would be an extensive if we decided to move forward and we haven't even decided to move forward on this type of a plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If we were to decide to move forward, there would be an extension extensive, I imagine many month, year long visioning process that would go out to every neighborhood, involve all sorts of of communities to envision what we would even do on this on the site.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely correct. That, in essence, before we go out with a comprehensive visioning process and get everybody's hopes and dreams alive, we need to know whether or not we have a developer team who, in fact, can deliver a project for us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it is absolutely critical that before we embark upon that extensive outreach process, we have that developer in hand. So that developer is in fact listening to the input and participating in that extensive public outreach. So again, really, this step that we're taking is really to determine what we want to do, whether or not it's feasible and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The way I interpret the Senate budget, doesn't this step essentially provide us an option? Correct. That doesn't mean that's the option that we will take, but it provides an option. It's my understanding that the issue would have to come before the council many times between now on numerous occasions, including any future council, on a variety of different'",
        "'speaker_11': 'decisions that would come before, on, on, on funding, on the project, on the visioning process, on a variety of different questions. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And what I like what I like to remind people of is that we started this process back in 2005 when with the first analysis, 25, 26, and we're still at it. So this is really spanning multiple city councils who have participated in this process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the Future City Council, in fact, will be significantly engaged in the completion if in fact, we move forward on this project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And then my last point is going to be and again, I had some conversations with with Mr. West about this. But I do think and I do believe in reviewing the engineering studies, that we do have a problem in this building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a serious problem. It's one that we should take seriously. And I think that, Mr. West, as as we do these reports and as you come back with more information, we should be looking at what are what are other options are, for whatever reason, we go through this process and we find out what our options are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this council or future council rejects those options. Or the option doesn't pan pan out, because we could come back with information that says this is just not financially possible or this won't work. For whatever reason, we still have a building that is structurally unsafe for our employees, and at the end of the day, we have to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'fix our problem. And so we need to start. And I think we have already. I know. Ms.. Frick, you said that we don't have an official plan, but I know you guys have already had discussions about what other options would be, what leasing would look like, which would be very expensive, but what leasing would look like in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'many other buildings, or if we'd have to relocate to other parts of the city. So that piece of the of the discussion is critical, I think. So let's bring some of that discussion, I think, to the forefront. We should do them parallelly, because I don't want to get to a point where one thing is rejected and then'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we have no plan. And I think we're going to have hopefully a couple a couple of plans in the works. Thank you. We'll go and go to the public or you have another comment?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I have a couple of quick questions. Can you please then enlighten me and the public what this public process is that you're doing right now? I mean, what is it that you're asking the public to give input on what they should tell the developers, how they should go and write an RF P because they're not being'",
        "'speaker_9': 'given the opportunity for input as to what should be done. Since you're since the purpose of the RFP is to go find out what can be done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilwoman Chips Key In the RFP, we have a somewhat abbreviated process that we're following that is intended to provide the short listed bidders the requirements of. Both Civic Center and the port in in the RFP. So we're going to be providing them not only programs but the functional needs of the civic center, both from the city hall'",
        "'speaker_7': 'perspective and the library perspective. The port has their own needs assessment and 30 year demand analysis, and we're converting that into a document that will hopefully inform the short bidders on how to come back to us with a financially feasible project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so the outreach to the public is to inform them that we are proceeding with this process and that we are not we don't have a project yet. We are only on the pathway of selecting a partner, a development partner.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The idea being to educate and inform the public that this is the process we're going through. And this is just two of probably countless outreach meetings that will occur as this project progresses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, in fairness, I don't think that's what the public understood, because we've got a great deal of people in the library community who thought it was an opportunity to come and give input, particularly because in the RFQ there was a figure put in there about what the in you and I.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr.. Conway We've had discussions on this where that figure came from about what should be the size of a new main library. And so when people are coming this morning, they really thought that it was to give input as to what direction to go.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I share and I think I've shared this with Mr. West. Unfortunately, I've heard from residents who overheard staff afterwards kind of ridiculing the people who had come up to say something by saying, Haha, I guess we got your our marching orders.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And these are credible residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have to interrupt that. That is adamantly false. That's not the case. We listened to the tapes and that is not that comment is not attributed to us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It wasn't said on tape, Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We listen to that. Listen to tape. We heard the comment is not attributed to staff. I have to adamantly protest that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Was it attributed to the consultant staff?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, who was it then? Because it was not. It was not. I mean, because you're you're making the question about public input. And to have people come to something and then have them feel that their input doesn't really matter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, again, that's the statement you're referring to is false.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. The second thing that said, Mr. West, that there's some additional when are the additional public sessions going to be on this aspect?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If I could add to that, we have been working closely, not only with the Library Foundation, but a consultant hired by the Library Foundation to better describe and define the library of the future. That information is going to be in our data room, which is accessible by all of the short bidders so that they can understand the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'position of the foundation and their consultant. So we believe we reached out to them. We believe that we are working together with them to better define what the future library looks like. And I'm hopeful that that cooperative spirit proceeds into the future and as that needs assessment gets translated into a design, is when we're going to go'",
        "'speaker_7': 'out to the public and seek their input from the entire entire entitlement process, which will be nine months to a year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Well, to questions, Mr. West mentioned the regret to Mr. Garcia that there is going to be some additional sessions. Do we know when they are so we can let the public know?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We councilmembers. We continue to stand ready to respond to any member of the community, any community group, any council group to appear and go to any meetings we've done to several already. And I'm getting direction from the council that we may want to go out and schedule some of our own, but certainly we're out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our website volunteering to go to any public meeting desired and we stand ready to go to anyone.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. And last but not least, Mr. Garcia brought something up. I don't think the rest of the council was ever aware of. You have worked out scenarios about leasing other property to move.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the city council has heard those scenarios.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Know the cost of leasing. Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. We can do those, too.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that was that was you know, that you included that in the cost for relocation, but you didn't talk about what potential buildings you're looking at to lease.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, the council's been informed of that and we'd be happy to provide that to you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, please. I would like to see the memo about the locations that have met. Identified.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. We're going to go to the public. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Mr. Vice Mayor. Gary Shelton, again. I didn't rush down because I think my comments are most important. I just have to be somewhere else in a few minutes. So I wanted to get my my thoughts in. I'm in favor of the motion as it stands right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anything that can give us an insight as to what seems to be some of the missing pieces of this conversation is welcomed. I did want to express just sitting there listening as closely as I could, that there are the cross purposes are being loudly spoken and there are there are some folks that seem to want things both'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ways, and it really can't work that way. What I'm what I'm talking about, I get to a couple of specifics is related to the idea of of of a retrofit financing would have to go into bond issuing and and be approved by the voters and by the issuers of the bonds that's spoken as if that's something bad'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I don't know that it's something bad. We have no no concept of why that would be an improper way to move forward. Maybe it's the best way. I really don't know. That's never been elucidated or there's been no light put on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other cross purpose that I heard was over and over was that this this RFP process is just a a search that we really don't know what the outcome is going to be. We don't know if it's going to be feasible or not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's looming large in the discussion, however. Then just five or 10 minutes later, Missouri State but not moving forward is a remote possibility. So like which is it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is it this is just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going up in the air and we don't know what's going to happen or is it not moving forward is a remote possibility. Which way is it? So learning more about the retrofit is going to help us understand that the the the remote possibility, by the way, was in the context of the $500,000 stipend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate the motion and the second and the discussion and I hope it passes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Good evening, Vice Mayor Garcia. City Council members, city staff. My name is Margaret Smith. I am a resident of the third district and I am speaking on behalf of the Long Beach Public Library Foundation. We appreciate the difficulty of these decisions and we respect your need to go forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From a cost and safety standpoint. But from the very beginning, the foundation has asked for an open, robust and transparent process for getting community input. Not just library supporters, but everyone's input about what they want for the future of their civic center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we have also voiced our concerns about the aggressive timeframe of this process. The request for proposals, as Mr. Conway has shown in many of his public community sort of outreach efforts, goes out February 28th or let's say March 1st, three months later.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those proposals are due back from our three pre-selected bidder teams. So that's three months to do a monumentally complex proposal. And then a month later in an evening meeting, just like this one on July 1st, city staff is going to come back to you at the city council with the proposed preferred proposed proposal and ask you to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'vote on that all in one meeting. And at that July 1st meeting, no one from the public will have seen those three proposals that have come back. And we are making a commitment to this team for a minimum of 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with all due respect, Ms.. Frick, when you say we're just testing the waters, we're going to be committing to a team and committing, at least in concept, to a design approach that we are going to have to deal with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I respectfully disagree that this is just a testing of the waters. This is a monumentally important decision that will be made July 1st, first with no community public input. If this current schedule goes ahead, we are asking that sometime in that month, between June 1st and July 1st, the public be given access to those proposals so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we can have and make informed input on July 1st. We don't think that there's adequate time in this process for community input, for adequate time to explore all the options and adequate time for the bid teams to create a proposal that a project of this magnitude warrants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if we do go forward, we do ask for that public input input in that all important month. We appreciate the respect and consideration that has been shown to us as the Library Foundation by Mr. Conway and Ms. Bodak.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have not heard anything about negative comments. We have been treated uniformly with respect and we very much appreciate forging this mutual partnership with the city to go forward, whatever you decide. In closing, I would ask two things that the public be given access to this retrofit cost analysis and that any additional public meetings that are going'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to be scheduled be done so with adequate publicity and adequate advance notice.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Jim McCabe, retired deputy city attorney. I just wanted to point out to the council who I'm sure has read the February 7th memo. My take on what's in there and what's not in there, what we do not know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As has been pointed out, whether it is commercially feasible. So the numbers thrown out by Mr. Conway all this time of 12 something million dollars a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Essentially out of thin air unless Mr. Conway tells us where these numbers came from. There are just guesses in the wind. We do not know as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whether.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The project is legal. The memo of February seven implies that California legislation is needed to make it legal, but says nothing about whether that legislation is likely. So we're going to be going a gaily forward without knowing whether we can ever do this project at all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we do know is that no California city has ever used this project for a municipal building. What we also know what is known is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No North American.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Project has ever shown three PE to work in the long term. How can they? There is enormous difficulty speaking as a as a as a retired lawyer. There is enormous difficulty in defining what the maintenance and care needs for a city hall 40 years in advance are going to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's no idea how this is going to be taken care of. One very big question remains is whether or not the city that all the city property reverts to the taxpayers at the end of the 40 year agreement, or it's a three year agreement or a 38 year agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've heard all these figures. Mr. Conway has told public meetings this a public meeting this last Saturday, that some property at least was will be owned by the developer at the end of the lease. Is this the old courthouse land and how much is it worth and how much does that figure into the supposed limit of 12'",
        "'speaker_7': 'something million dollars a year?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What gives? What's the rush?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The memo suggests more public outreach, yet the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Voted to limit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Public outreach. And I just I'm just baffled by the by the whole process it had. Thank you. I may have. Second, if I if I've had the impression this is a little like the like the Wizard of Oz.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you, Robert.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll. I'll just finish up one sentence. Thank you. Just. Just believe the city manager and Mr. Conway.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Time's up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Please don't ask who the man behind the curtain is. Thank you very much for your additional forbearance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor and City Council. I'm Kerry Gallagher, and I'm the executive director of Housing Long Beach. My address is on file. I just wanted to thank you all for having the opportunity to open up this dialog to the public and with our elected officials.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a huge opportunity for a Long Beach. It's a really big decision, and I, along with many residents of the city, have not been entirely clear on how the process has moved forward. So I really appreciate thank Ms..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Gypsy as well as the rest of the Council for having this dialog. So if the Council does decide to move forward with a new civic center, this has an enormous opportunity or even a retrofit. There are enormous opportunities to serve the communities of Long Beach, the community of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I'd like to just point out a couple of things that especially jobs and housing advocates have been talking about for some time now and hope will be considered as the dialog moves forward. So from start to finish, this really has multiple spaces in which we can insert as a city community benefits that will improve the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'condition of life for our residents. We commend you on recognizing that the project should include a project labor agreement. However, we think we should go even further and include living wages as well as a local hire provision. It makes total sense to hire our residents, especially our low income residents, for the jobs that are going to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'created from this project. And this should be a no brainer to include in the project and in the RFP as it moves forward. Additionally, it's under quite a bit of consideration, from my understanding that housing will be included in the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so as our civic center, as a piece of land that is intended to serve the Long Beach community, there should be affordable housing included. And so we started to have these dialogs with a few of you. We hope to go in much deeper as far as how we can include community benefits in this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are a number of other pieces, not just in jobs and housing, but child friendly resources, gender neutral bathrooms, a library that serves everybody, and a number of things that so many residents have come out to support. And so as housing Long Beach and our coalition of partners, we hope that we can continue this dialog with you'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Vice Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Can I just add that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In the project labor agreement, there is a local hire provision? Yeah, there is. That was written into that message.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's of all the project labor agreements we've done in Long Beach. We've included a local hire provision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's the percentage?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, I don't know the exact percentage because it depends on the project. Realizing that some projects, some of the trades are far out. You know, you're not going to find the number of pile drivers you need in Long Beach to construct the bridge.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it's on a trade by trade project by project basis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we could have either you or city staff help us get the.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name is Lee Fukui. I live in the Wrigley District, sixth district. I went to the first RFP meeting and I was really dismayed that it was less than half full. Not enough notification, not enough communication about this grand project that we have here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Civic Center is going to involve every taxpayer here. And yet these meetings weren't communicated well. And if you look at this whole process has not been communicated well. In fact, if you look at it, everything about it doesn't look right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, but I know you've talked.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For years, but it hasn't really been communicated to the public. When I talk to my neighbors about this. They're shocked about what's going on. You know, there's this a multimillion dollar effort here to rebuild civic center. And yet no one really knows about it except for the few here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I really want to do is what I really came here was to ask you to support council memberships. KEYES Motion. That this is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not fair.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To to the residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't know what's going on. This talk of RFP and all the money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not making sense first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the first meeting, we were told that it was going to cost.'",
        "'speaker_9': '$818.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A square foot. Now we got another thing. Information, $685 a square foot. So, you know, there's these wide and.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Under to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seismic retrofit because they experienced two earthquakes. They did not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tear anything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Down. They retrofitted. And yet retrofitting was not even discussed until today. And it's this whole process has been backwards and you need to fix it. You have a second opportunity to do this by. By passing this motion and stalling this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is taxpayer money. And we need to know exactly what's being spent and where it's going. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When he was there. He. Gonzales, I just was on fire. Long term, I guess. Civic Center activist by default. My my whole course is the rooftop, the neglected rooftop that's been on top of the library. That is the whole reason we tried closing the library.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What was that? Six years ago when we had the same surge? A sense of urgency. Oh, there's an the earthquake. The big one's going to come. And we haven't done anything in the past six years now, six months before the mayor is about to go out of office and many of you are leaving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of a sudden, that urgency is back. And unlike six months ago or six years ago when it was raining and you had this big dramatic effect of all the rain coming into the library, I don't know that you guys are prepared to show us anything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think you guys are ready to take the public and say, oh, here's our plan for a new civic center. Here's one how we're going to pay for it. Because, for example, I've heard and I've seen this like weird Twin Towers thing in the press telegram with the port, who's going to pay for that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I've heard of this whole P3 is going to pay for it. From a business perspective, you don't get something for nothing. So assuming that the private is going to pay for this public entity, they're not just going to do it for nothing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're not they're not doing it out of the generous generosity of their heart. Somebody somebody's got to lose something. And my understanding of how a P3 works is that the private developer will, in the end acquire the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that's what the former deputy attorney was just referring to. So before we make that kind of decision where we get rid of public property, probably property that was inherited to the public in 1904 when the land was bequeathed in a will, a very expensive public property, ocean and pine, ocean, Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we need to talk to the public first, and I think that's what we keep on hearing. I'm pretty sure that's what everybody just said, including council memberships key and, you know, a few of the other councilors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't understand the urgency. I don't understand the haste. I've been here for a long time now, six years, and I've been wanting to talk about the Civic Center. I've been wanting to have this big, transparent discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You guys know me by now. I've done this many times, and yet I haven't had anything yet. You guys have always moved forward, you know, I didn't expect to have and I'm sure you guys remember a team of architects actually draw up a proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had no idea where that was going to come from. Are you kidding me? Like, I'm not qualified to come up with a proposal for how we're going to readapt to the main library. But they are. And I think you guys should take a look at that before you decide in the next five months, before you leave'",
        "'speaker_0': 'office, that, you know, it's absolutely, absolutely for certain that we have to destroy and rebuild an entire new library with magic, imaginary money that's supposed to come from the port, which is a big yes or no. Maybe we need to, before going to the public, know for sure how we're going to pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'BE And I say that also because we haven't yet paid for the current one that we're not taking care of. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Need to have a more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thorough understanding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the rationale and why this has.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Rather than on the most equitable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And possibly more visionary solutions. We have heard several figures on the cost of.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And they were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Dismissed as too costly or prohibitive.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor and council members. My name is Matt Eichner. My address is on record. I had a whole other thing planned because I really wanted to have this postponed. You and I were going to come up here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Real quick, just if you're going to speak. Would you mind queuing up if you plan on speaking on the item so we can get to it quicker? No other no other speakers on the item. Okay. Please queue up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Please continue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So I originally was we I'm sorry. I wanted this whole process slowed down. I was going to come out to public comment actually tonight. And then I discovered that this was agenda. And I'm very grateful for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you very much. I was at the library meeting on the very first one on the 25th and or the meeting at the library. And Mike Conway shared and Amy had shared a lot of numbers and the timeline, and we were all shocked by the timeline because it suddenly was very rushed is based on this motion'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tonight. And I guess I'm asking you a question. Are you guys slowing it down? The RFP is going to be released on the 28th or the first that's still going to happen. Is that or is this slowing that down?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that process getting slowed down from this?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'According to the motion right now, the process is moving forward at the same time that's been set out, but there'll be additional information brought to the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And I'm also concerned about the additional information because like I like Lee, it said that at the meeting on the 25th, $818 a square foot for retrofit is what was presented, whereas for 54 brand new build was the other number presented.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that number has always stayed constant, although that's the one that we possibly can't really know. And retrofitting is something that has been done in other civics city halls and as Lee had pointed out as well. Sorry if I am bouncing off of him.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And anyways, my our concern is that this number that we keep hearing which dropped to 685 and then tonight, I think it was another number that was lowered. These numbers sound made up and based on some calculations from eight years ago from one company, and it just seems like this information is not necessarily good or accurate to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what really is the case. And I don't understand why an RFP also wouldn't be released concurrently with the new versus the retrofit. I mean, why wouldn't you get both information? I mean, maybe that's what the motion is anyways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm just concerned. I wanted it to slow down. I was really hoping that the motion, as it originally was, would stick. Since it's not, I do appreciate that you're looking at the retrofit as all and we really do feel that this has not been brought to transparency as it should be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there is a lot of suspicion and we hear lots of rumors as to why it's moving so quickly. And a lot of it has to do with the election, and we don't want that to be true. And I think I have one last thought that I wanted to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, Mr. West, I actually heard on my way to the garage the I believe it was the the woman who was running the RFP, I don't know what it's called, the consulting firm, talking to what I believe was the developers and they kind of she said, what are your marching?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, your marching orders? And they kind of jokingly said, Oh, yeah, I put in this and put in that. And maybe, you know, it was light and on the way to the restaurant that they were going through or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't know who exactly it was, but I heard it and it was it did make me feel like this is a joke. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rick Ilitch addresses on file. You know, first of all, I want to say respectfully that I acknowledge the pressure that you as the council are under. Having sat there for eight years, I know that everything could come at you quite quickly and decisions get made quite quickly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that a lot of times staff presents things in certain ways, and you're comfortable with that. But the public is being very vocal. I would like to remind you of everybody seen the movie Chicago. There's the song.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Give them the old razzle dazzle. Well, that's quite appropriate. Here again, this reminds me so much. And I and I want to say that I respect the job that you do. I mean, you're defending what you have to do or what you feel you're supposed to do, but you have a job to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And your job is to question everything that they put in front of you so that the people that you represent are satisfied with the outcome of that. And I would hope that there will be a substitute motion on this to stop this and make sure that everybody is informed to the best of your ability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, what is the right I know what the rush is. I'm not going to stand up here and criticize anybody. But, you know, I just I have to say that this smells just like the 2001 Long Beach Airport project that was pushed down the throats of council, who really didn't take the time to understand the implications'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And that resulted in six years, six years of council debate and lawsuits before we finally reached consensus and did it right. So now everybody is happy and proud of that outcome. I hope that you consider doing the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will say that one, two, three, four council members had a comment on this the last time I was here and we talked about this sushi. You couldn't stop talking about it. Seize the opportunity. Hardly ever. This hardly ever presents itself, you know?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, don't you care? Is aren't you interested in the outcome? Don't you think that the public that put you there deserves a right to participate in such an enormous project? You know, here's what I'm hearing, Suzanne. You said that the peer review was done and now the entire building is in jeopardy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that because of new physical changes to the structure, because of the land that we're on, or is it because of higher standards within the industry? You know, I could not construct my reconstruct my house with the design that I did in 1988 because of standards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that what we're talking about? You can't do the double speak. You've got to ask for the study session, provide the information to the community and to the council, and then let's make a decision to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Joel Weinstein, 4000 Linden Avenue. I wrote a rather irate letter to you earlier this afternoon, and I don't know whether I should retracted or emphasize it. The problem is the decision you took on the 3rd of December. It's not that the project is bad.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not that the project did not have sufficient public input or in fact, contradicted public input. Those are big problems, but they're not the biggest problem. The biggest problem on December 3rd is you opted deliberately for a decision procedure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That said, we do not want to look at alternatives. We have a defined problem and we insist on grabbing just the first alternative put on the plate and to reject and blind ourselves to any information on anything else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the basic of what you did on December 3rd. And until you produce a motion that looks at all alternatives, unbiased way that will solve the problem. There's really no satisfactory action here. Because the prime legacy of this process is not going to be a building or a specific rehousing of our headquarters and our city hall staff'",
        "'speaker_0': '. It's going to be the decision method that you are sending as the message of your preferred decision methods. And I was really irate not only as an ordinary homeowner and taxpayer of your refusal to look at alternatives, but also as a math and logic, Ph.D. Who knows a little bit about modern decision analysis?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what does that modern decision analysis tell you? What common sense has told people who are solving problems for thousands of years that the first step in a rational decision procedure is to look at a spectrum of alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like What would it be to have an alternative building somewhere else in town? You go by Douglas Park and they're saying, Come build here. This is a project that you supported. Why isn't there an alternative that's looking at Douglas Park, among other places?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have people here that brag about how we're a digital city. What about the Internet age alternative, where instead of cramming workers expansively all together into one big, vulnerable building, you put them in distributed neighborhoods, centers economically. And this is not feeling this is how I've been working for the state of California for over ten years as'",

I think you've talked about the $33 million we received in from the dissolution of the RTA this year and about or in FY13, about 17,000,001 time oil money in FY 13 council appropriated that money and then the balance of that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'money was appropriated in the 514 budget, the budget we're now in. Overall, in FY 13, the general fund had about a $3.3 million surplus. There was a surplus of about $4.4 million in the up once oil fund. That is what you are discussing, those numbers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city manager is proposing that the 5% of the surplus be used to help fund unfunded liabilities in accordance with council policy. So he's recommending that 300 and some thousand dollars be set aside in accordance with council policy for that purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The balance of the upland oil money would be used to help complete some of the projects intended to be funded by the RDA. And the city managers talked about that in the bulk of the one time surplus, and the general fund would be used to help support police staffing and overtime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And most of that surplus that we were talking about in the general fund is in fact a police department surplus. So it simply rolls that money over into the police department. And in FY 13, the surplus was due primarily to attrition.'",

That certainly comes when we find one time money available, as we did the large amount of money that we had while we're putting the budget together. But the year end amount, the year in surplus or the year in closing just comes to the city council.'",

Council Member DeLong, you've always been a budget hawk, and and I do appreciate your thoughtful approach to, you know, possibly redistributing these these funds.

        "'speaker_10': 'Acknowledged that. So I mean.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I understand that. But I thought that at that time when we that was brought forth, that that was considered to be what was necessary at the time, because the library isn't going to be opening for two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Yes, that was 1.5 million approximately in one time dollars that we set aside. So when the library was built, we'd have those dollars available for fixtures, equipment and books.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so these additional funds would be used for one for the library.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The additional 4 million tonight would be used to build the library.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Help me on this. I thought we had previously budgeted funds for the construction because that was called up in question. Why would we budget money for materials and equipment if we didn't have the funding available to build it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had $8 million from the agency. Again, we were hoping to get 12. We're going forward with the agency, hoping that we'd get money on the ropes. That didn't happen. We did have some one time money that we came back to the city through the redevelopment agency.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We we're hoping that that 4 to $5 million would be allocated to the library, and it was not. So we're looking for these funds to go be first to use to look at the library for completion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Another different subject, because I don't see it accounted for any place. What happened to $184,000 we appropriated for Code for America? I assume that those coders were supposed to be here in January.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yes, that money is. Councilmember That money is being spent. We have a group of Code for America staffers who are working on the 14th floor and working with all the departments to do that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Working for.'",
        "'speaker_1': '14 for. Yes, at this time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. We didn't get. Did you send a memo on that, that they were there?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're working through the mayor's office.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What? Since the council appropriated the money, could we have maybe a memo that indicates they're there and what they're working on? That would be. Appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's a real.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. And yes, I'd just like to remind this body, as the city manager is saying, we've always been 4 million short since the loss of redevelopment. We did have a plan during the budget process to address that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this body chose to divide by nine, which still leaves us short without doing this right now, it is going to seriously delay this project and where we're going to find ourselves in the same situation again. So I would urge my colleagues to support staff recommendation that we move this $4 million now to get the city manager'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to the point where we have the $12 million that we need to make this thing reality.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Karen, to make a substitute motion to refer the item to the Budget Oversight Committee and charge the committee coming back with several recommendations. We'll start with the staff recommendation. So certainly keep it on the table, but look at what other opportunities there are to provide city wide investments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. There's been a motion and a second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we can do that very quickly. Mr. NEILL So doesn't delay the process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. Mueller, your comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My my comment is, although definitely not in favor of that. No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I won't be supporting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I just have a question on the on the maybe the timing issue for Mr. West. So I do have a question on the on the north side, but what's the give me the total amount again here. We're talking about total tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're talking about $4 million. We have $8 million in the bank or in escrow. We're anticipating the library to come in at someone about somewhere between 11 and $12 million, but we won't know that until we actually get hard bids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so as as far as as far as the delay on the library piece, the library piece of the funding or what what what can I would that cause any issues for the the process of actually getting that project going?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are not planning to go out to bid. I'm looking I misspoke, April. So the first week in April we planned to go out to bid. So whatever the if the boss or the council's looking at this, we would hope we wouldn't go out to bid until we knew the amount of dollars that we had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So first week in April.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Mr.. We along with that, would you plan on meeting before that? And I think the last thing anybody wants is to delay any sort of progress for the for the library.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I agree with you. And we could certainly commit to meeting within 30 days and getting it on the council's agenda a week afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Katherine Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, thanks, Vice Mayor. And I do think it's appropriate to have robust discussion of such an important item. But I think that the council members to my left, I think councilors, Neal, and often have a good point that the North Library really is a citywide asset and we have an obligation to look at our entire city north'",
        "'speaker_1': ', south, east and west. So with that, I'd like to make this substitute substitute motion that we approve the staff recommendation. But in addition to that, we do send to the Budget Oversight Committee simply the question of looking at our police expenditures and analyzing certainly looks like where there are some shortfalls we're using for funding for here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Taking a look at whether there may be shortfalls in this current year and reporting back to the city council, but still basically approving this and just sending them to the question of police funding search.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Emotion in a second. Kathryn Brosnan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just wanted to get clarification. Who sits on the Budget Oversight Committee?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Chair, myself and Mr. O'Donnell and Ms.. Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Just want to get clarification on that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilor DeLong.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Johnson, I appreciate that. Substitute I guess the only one of the concerns I would have I'd like to look at is, you know, I would like to understand a little more about what is the projected total cost of the North Library.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know this. For example, if there's any remainder would go to Atlantic Media and Oregon Park. Well, if there's a hundred thousand remainder or $1,000,000 remainer or $2 million remainder, does it go to that? Are those the two most important projects for the North as well as citywide, you know, or any other district?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess this is just it just seems very nebulous to me the way numbers are being plugged in here. But I do agree that the North Library's important project, I do think it's a citywide asset. But since we have time, yeah, I'd like to see the Budget Oversight Committee just be able to come back and present some'",
        "'speaker_6': 'alternatives. I know that I've mentioned a couple of alternatives. I've heard others. And I would also say I'm interested in any other alternatives that a councilman would like to say, well, you know, include this in there, and I would do that as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think we could do a good job of providing more information on this alternative as well as others.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Could you staff comment on the points Mr. DeLong just made with regard to the money going to other projects? Because that's kind of like saying I'm going to fly to Hawaii and then maybe I'll go to China. And I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, I don't know what the nexus is between the two projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Surprise me that would be slipped in there like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those projects are part of the redevelopment bond. The redevelopment bond from 2010 or 11 included the library included shorter hall. It included the Atlantic medians, it included the artesian means, which are no longer in existence because we didn't have the funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It included Oregon, Oregon Park. So we're looking at the specific projects that were included in the redevelopment bond, which fell short when the agency died. Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And listen, I don't have a problem with the library. It's necessary. Mr. Neill has made his case to me, and I know the children of that neighborhood well. But what I do have a concern is all of a sudden there's other projects on there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, with redevelopment gone, help me understand the nexus between oil money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, the nexus is these are the projects that were in the redevelopment bond that fell short. We would have no issues whatsoever. I'm looking at Councilmember Neal and Austin that if you just capped it at the at the librarian, any additional funds would go back to the block for for allocation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But so I would think that would be a matter of common practice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, no, the idea was these are all projects that were tied to the redevelopment bonds. Right. That is the nexus. The only reason we're looking at it in this fashion is because those are the projects. Had we fell and fall short, if we fell short in the shorter haul project, we would then you'd see shorter haul here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for the East Police Station. But we didn't fall. We weren't falling short in that city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am still not convinced.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'How those projects got labeled in there. I get the library, I'm with you on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, just to point out that the four or $5 million that did come back to the city one time for the agency was utilized to divide by nine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. That's a matter of fact. I don't know how that's relevant to this point here that I'm trying to make, though. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Concern for the wrong.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's okay. I'll pass. Thank you, Rosemary. I guess the only I would say is that I think the other thing that the U.S. could do on this is to look, if there's any other alternative sources of funds, because I'm not sure that using surplus fiscal year funds to backfill RDA is necessarily the best approach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd be curious to see what other source of funds and I have a few ideas of whether there might be dollars that might be a better source for this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. There is country radio.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. You know, I think this is a healthy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Discussion, but I do. And I appreciate Councilmember DeLong and his staff on this and looking at budget solutions. My my biggest concern is making sure that we don't prolong the construction of the library. And the longer this the communities in the north have been involved in this project for well over a decade.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're right at the threshold of making this happen. And again, we had a plan in the last budget cycle on how to get to the 12 million, and this body divided that by nine. So that's why we're here today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm imploring you to invest another $4 million to get us to the 12 million that we know we're going to need to make this thing happen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Was the most conservative one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I'd say, is that I share your concerns about any delays, but at least based on the kind of tive time frame of their RFP, I'm very confident the VRC could meet and come back to the Council in a timely manner that would make sure there weren't any delays moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. We're going to go ahead. And the motion on the floor. Is a motion by Councilmember Johnson, I believe it was seconded by.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember ousted.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember Austin. And this, just to be clear, is a motion to get the library funding piece today, but then move on all other items related to what's in here over to B or C.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't. I'll let Mr. Johnson speak about that. Go ahead. I think one thing that's discussed here is that there's been some issues in the police department in terms of not trading and needing one time fund, etc.. So my motion was basically to accept a staff recommendation for the funding and separately just to ask the PSC to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'take a look at our police department in terms of, you know, do we expect further ongoing problems in terms of attrition, etc.? So that was my motion.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Sure. I've got to follow up on that. And then you.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Cuts were drawn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I guess I'm I'm a little concerned about kind of singling out PD and having the Budget Oversight Committee say, we're only going to look on this one particular piece. So I guess my preference would be to kind of send all of it to us and have a look at it and get some recommendations back or kind'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of none of it. I mean, what we'll do at the council directs us to do, but I don't know that I'm comfortable zooming in on just one department. That's part of an overall recommendation.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'No, we don't. It happened. It happened really quick, and we didn't hear it. I'm fairly confident was down the left there because you're approving the staff recommendation. And then I came on top of the substitutes, I believe it was Council Member Neil.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Who actually help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People on a daily basis quit smoking. Electronic cigarets work. But they are not being marketed to children. The flavors are intended for adults. It is illegal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Already to sell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Electronic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cigarets to people under 18. That's already been taken care of. We're doing all more research and we'll continue to do so. So I ask you to at least.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Postpone or stop this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Which will hurt the people of Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please leave.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I leave science with you?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Actually, the clock over here. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor and council members. My name is Paula Wood and I am a resident of District seven and I am currently the co-chair of the Tobacco Up in Smoke Free Long Beach, along with Pete Flores. We're deeply concerned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First of all, we'd like to commend the council for moving this issue forward and dealing with it tonight. And we hope that you will vote in favor of this. We have a deep concern about what's going on with the e-cigarettes and the paper products.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We notice that many of these or these these these these stations or these stores are cropping up in our neighborhoods. And we're concerned about, even though there may be they're not legally be able to being able to be sold to the young people there on the campuses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have teen groups. I've talked to our young people and they're telling me they're all over the high school, they're available and the young people are attracted to them because of the colors and the just that it's something new.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so they are in the hands of our youth and we're deeply concerned because this is new and we know that there is tobacco and nicotine involved, and we're concerned that this is creeping up all over the city and there's no regulation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we support the council in their effort to regulate these and treat them the same as Cigarets. And we ask you to support this tonight on behalf of the coalition of a smoke free Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Nick. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name is P floors were from Paula Woods. I am a co-chair for the Long Beach Coalition. Mayor and councilman, this is actually my second time being here, observing you guys and all that. And I, I really just wanted to say with this being a co-chair and, and also.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Coordinator for Project Greater Southern Cal that we deal with educational to youth. And I go to car shows and I educate the youth about smoking and e-cigarettes. Now we revise our our surveys with the youth because we had to put in with the e-cigarettes and the vapes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I know that this is a ongoing battle. It's been ongoing for a long, long time. And I just wanted to I just want to go forward with this with you know, with the council of hoping to go ahead and go forward with this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor Garcia. Council members, thank you for bringing this forward. I think there must be a misunderstanding on the part of either Jack. This does not this ordinance does not prevent people from using e-cigarettes if they feel it helps them stop smoking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What this does do is put nicotine charged, electronic cigarets in the same category as far as preventing the smoking in public places. The gentleman in the plaid shirt gave us a distinct opportunity to understand what happens. We're used to this council not having smoking, but all of a sudden there was this puff of smoke in the air'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And I could smell it. And you could. And you don't know what's in it. There's formaldehyde, there's benzene. There have not been complete studies to know what we're breathing from secondhand smoke. So we're asking that the electronic cigarets be treated like tobacco cigarets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The FDA is working on a regulation because of the need to understand better what the health aspects of this are at the Center for Disease Control over two years. The 2011 2000. 2012 found that twice as many teenagers have taken up e-cigarettes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it went from like 4% to 10%. My neighbor came home and found her son, who was that totally non tobacco smoking youth sitting with an e-cigarette and thinking that that was a glamorous thing to do. So we asked that you pass this so that those of us can go to a public place and find that we're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not reading some chemical we know not what coming from one of the electronic cigarets and that our tobacco retail permit process. Watch over these sites so that we know what's happening there and we urge you to pass this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank any of the public speakers up here. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Frances and Frances Emily Tyson Harris and I reside in District one. This is a very controversial matter and I agree on both sides. There are series of facts in. And when I made that comment I'm making in the sense that they're serious, the facts that can affect your health in terms of smoking cigarets which are known to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have formaldehyde and all kinds of other things in regards to and cause cancer, you know, aggravate people to have asthma attacks, etc.. That in terms of the e-cigarette, I look at it more like a evade hearing. I'm not 100% familiar with the whole thing about the e-cigarette, but I can say that I do have friends and I'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know people that smoke and they smoke and they changed to using the e-cigarette and they were able to cut down tremendously in regards to smoking and quite a number of them actually have quit and they feel so much more better.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now I look back at the matter regarding interest in marijuana have could affect you and all of the things about what the federal government thought in the state and everything else. And when I'm hearing everyone and what they're having to say, the federal government, I understand, is in the process of determining something about this matter and how'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it should be addressed. Well, I kind of wonder if it may not be a bad idea to put this matter off to find out exactly yay or nay what's happening in terms of the e-cigarette. I don't think it's something that has to be addressed right now, this moment, because to me matters that need to be looked at'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to know exactly, you know, what's happening here. And I do appreciate Lambie's being smoke free. I think it's absolutely essential. I feel there should be regulations in terms of the use of this product. I'm deeply concerned by young people getting their hands on it, but I'm hearing all of these matters and to me there's too many unanswered'",
        "'speaker_9': 'questions and matters I feel that need to be addressed in order to be able to move forward without coming back and having all kinds of problems on your hands. I think if you get the answers more find on this matter, I think you'll be able to move forward in a matter where it's not going to be so'",
        "'speaker_9': 'many stumbling blocks. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Any other public comments after after unexpectedly other public comments came at a good cause, a public speaker less piece.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A Roseanne Lamendola. Again, I hope you follow your commonsense and avoid any. Extra additional smoking venues in the city of Long Beach. If anyone is considering this as a a negative move, if your support of e-cigarettes, please look what happened to cigar smoking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A business decision was made to allow cigar smoking within the shops, and somehow that evolved to smoking again in public areas, exposing everyone to increased health risks. So if you are in favor of e-cigarettes, please contain it inside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do not let it evolve to the point where it has. With our outdoor cigar lounges, there are many young people, young adults in their twenties, male and female, who think it's very hip and cool to smoke a cigaret when again we know this is a documented hazard to your health.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. We're going to get behind the council controversial scheme.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Mr. Perkin, in reading the ordinance, is this specific only to e-cigarettes that have a nicotine, that utilize a nicotine product or are all e-cigarettes?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the direction given on the December 3rd meeting of the City Council was all cigarets, not just limited to nicotine legally.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm wondering, can we do that and classify the non nicotine non tobacco product as a under the rubric of our tobacco ordinance about candy. Yeah, I'm going to and about the candies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have followed. Yes, we've followed other jurisdictions and looked at other cities who have adopted these ordinances and I believe were consistent with the other cities where we have been asked to regulate those products as in the same manner as we are currently regulating tobacco products.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the restrictions would be the same as a CIGARET product, so wouldn't be able to be consumed inside an enclosed space. That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What about the issue of the what they call the Candy Cigarets? In fact, we got a letter from the American Lung Association regarding the fruit or candy flavors such as Captain Crunch, Gummy Bear, cotton candy, atomic fireball and Froot Loops.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like a fireball. Yeah. I'm sorry if it's a question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, what I'm asking those are if they do not have nicotine in them, then they're going to be precluded from selling any product that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It does not preclude the sale. Again, they can that the cigarets we're not banning the cigarets we were regulating them similar to Cigarets. So by definition the electric cigarets we've added those definitions and it is not exclusive to those products containing nicotine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And then how are we regulating the the shops as we do with the tobacco shops right now? I believe our health department. I may be wrong, but I think our health department goes out and verifies whether or not under the I think our Smokefree Coalition about whether or not that they are displaying appropriately, are they under'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the same regulations then as the tobacco shops about how they can promote and put advertisement at a certain level and making sure they don't sell to kids?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. The regulations and the the way we've amended the ordinance in two separate chapters, 5.81 and 8.68. We have we have added to the definition section to define the electronic cigarets and then made all of the applicable regulations regarding tobacco products applicable to them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if it's covered in 5.81 or 8.68, it would be now applicable to electronic cigarets or vaping.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if I recall, under the ordinance regarding tobacco shops, you're not allowed to unless there is a we don't have the cigaret lounges. I thought we. Yeah. The cigar lounge but I don't think you have the cigaret lounges correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. I believe there's eight currently allowed cigar lounges.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But so if people purchase this product at these tobacco shops or whatever the e-cigarette shops, they would not be allowed to sit on the premises and, and, and use them outside.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is the well they would be allowed to use them. When you say outside it, meaning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They couldn't sit in chairs and and use the product because I understand that's our tobacco ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. You would not be able to consume the product within the within the business or within so many feet of the entrance of the business, similar to the way that Cigarets are currently regulated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And do we have any idea when FDA is like maybe this company could answer that when we think the FDA might be coming up with some kind of recommendations? I know that they're looking at it, but is there any kind of indication when we'd get a report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't know when that would be the status currently moving forward? It's passed the Senate and it's sitting at the assembly and they're looking at a statewide conversation that looks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Exactly like this one. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We can't we can't we can't do it. We can't ask questions. Sorry that way. But counsel worships with you all. Any other comments? Oh, I do have a I do have a quick question also for for the city attorney as far as the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's my understanding that there there is a difference. All right. As far as on the the vaping cigaret, there are those that have nicotine and then those that do not. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct. It's the so the e-cigarette is a device essentially that you can drop with whatever you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Want it to do and uses a vapor. So you can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can easily use a nicotine product. You can use a non nicotine product, you can use THC, you can put whatever it is you'd like to in there. And it depends on whatever is being sold. And yes, so there are some that are that do not have nicotine in them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And then those are the four the cities that have done regulation. Have any cities actually separate those categories out? I'm just curious, or is it all been one size fits all?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not sure, but I'm not sure about that. I don't believe so. In fact, a number of people, a lot of cities around the area have said we're just going to ban them for a year until we figure out what's going on so that the others that I know of have treated it exactly as it as they'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would a tobacco product.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's consistent with our research on other cities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Where if we pass what we passed tonight, the retail establishments that have opened would still be allowed to be in place, correct? They still be able to sell the products that they're currently selling, but they would not be able to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But establishments or businesses would not be allowed to or wouldn't wouldn't be able to allow people to smoke the vaping cigarets. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I understand, you're correct. Yes. The stores would would not be closed. They would just not be allowed to consume the product inside of the establishment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So there are currently 18 shops that have been.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That are currently doing business as vapor only shops.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So, you know, I'm just going to close my comments here. I completely understand where where this is coming from. I understand the concern. And for me, the only part that's difficult for me to to get over is I have a couple of friends and family members that have particularly one that's been smoking for 35 years and has'",
        "'speaker_11': 'destroyed his lungs and he's never been able to quit, tried everything in the book and now he has been he has tried to e-cigarette and he's actually been able to quit. And I certainly don't know all the science behind what's in that cigaret, but I couldn't imagine it being, you know, obviously worse than nobody was putting in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'his lungs before. But but I understand that this essentially is is really about the public. And that's I think what I'm trying to to understand is this this would not outlaw the sale but would just outlaw the use of it as we do for Cigarets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it would be consistent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With his usage for the last 35 years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's correct. We have before us. Does this have a one year kind of review as well or a review process?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It does not. But at any Tuesday, the council could come back and amend or tweak this ordinance if there was a further desire to do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if there is if if tonight if we wanted to put in a, let's say a ah review of this policy, it at six months or a year, would that mean another reading or could be could we add that in if if if the council member agreed to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The the ordinance is here this evening for first reading so it would not become final until after a second reading. And then 31 days after the mayor signs the ordinance, at which time then you would have your ordinance is in effect with no review, period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if there was the council's desire to revisit this at some time, they could ask staff to come back at a certain at a future date if in fact it is passed tonight. But if we.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If we put a review period in it tonight, would we have to come back for another first reading or could it passed as a first reading?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would need to come back for first reading again if you're making a change of the standards of nature.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, Councilor Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I think you have a good point. I think no one here wants to ban e-cigarettes. We're not banning e-cigarettes. I think that's simply what we're trying to do is treat them like regular cigarets. And certainly if science comes out and there are turned out there are problems with e-cigarettes or they're less than we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'expect because certainly change the ordinance and that we have the power to do that. So I think we're open to the science. One thing I want to bring up is I think the vice mayor had a good point about, well, what about if they have nicotine in them or they don't have an equity in them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the problem there, I think, practically speaking, how would the store owner ever know the difference? Right. So if you're seeing someone vaping, you really are in a position to know, is there a THC in there, nicotine in there, or is it just water or whatever?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think as a practical matter, I do think it's rational for us to treat all vaping the same because we don't want people to be put in a position of, well, let me vape off of that myself to see what's in there or something like that would be kind of an absurd result.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I do think it's appropriate treat all vaping the same way, you know. So I just want to defend the audience in that way.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Any other council comment? See? None. So this is a vote on a first reading will happen and will come back for coming back to council for an additional reading before we move forward on it. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So, Members, please go ahead and and cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I got him in. Motion carries five votes. One vote no.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Believe we're now going to move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On to new business.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'New business. Councilor O'Neill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.'"
