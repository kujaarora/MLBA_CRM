    "Resolution on Spending Priorities for Transient Occupancy Tax Increase.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's give them a round of applause. Thank you very much for being here. We are now continuing on the agenda. We're going to move up and go to item 17, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adam, 17, is communication from City Attorney Recommendation to Adobe resolution expressing intent to prioritize spending of the transient occupancy tax increase for specific purposes. If approved by the voters in the March 30, 2020 special election. City Wide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm just going to do a couple of opening comments and then I have some public comment. I just want to again add and say that I was really proud to work with all of our arts organizations in the city, as well as our Convention and Visitors Bureau to propose, measure, be on the ballot that the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council unanimously put on the ballot. Measure B is a transformational measure that, of course, does two things. One is it provides stable and consistent funding for all of our major arts organizations in the city, museums, theater groups, and of course, supports the Arts Council in a much larger way, which will then give us the ability to also'",
        "'speaker_0': 'support artists smaller grants, mural programs, community art and and other purposes. In addition, it also provides stable annual funding to make upgrades to the Convention and Visitors Center, which of course is the home of many of these arts organizations as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that was that is Measure B, and what you have in front of you is a resolution that, of course, as we know, we adopted one of these as well for for Measure A, and we did that when we passed Measure A the first time as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so there is a motion and a second. But I want to ask Kelly Lucero, Steve Goodling and Cantrell, Karen Deci and Paul Garmon all to come forward in that order, please. Kelly Lucero, Steve Goodling and Cantrell, Karen Deci and Paul Garment to please come to the mike in that order.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Sarah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Miss Kelly Lucero and president of the Long Beach Symphony. And on behalf of the Symphony's Board of directors, we urge you to adopt the resolution before you, which prioritizes spending of the funds that would result from the total increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Funding will support the Symphony's inclusion and diversity activities by providing increased arts education programs in schools and after schools and on the weekends for all residents. We are deeply, deeply grateful to the Mayor and the City Council for your visionary support the city's arts organizations, artists, cultural programs and education.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This action is unprecedented and it's extraordinary. And I've never been more proud to be a 33 year resident of this great city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Sarah. Mr. Goodling.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor, Council, also city manager. I, first of all, thank you for getting us this far. And last summer, I had the privilege of talking with the hoteliers individually. And they all said, Steve, we agree this would be a great thing for the city to help continue our arts programing, many of which use the convention center, continue to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'create this core vibrant area, but also some of the others like the museums and musical theater west further out. In addition, a study was recently completed by the city. An independent study 55 million is needed to take care of old mechanical that is 60 years old that we can't buy replacement parts for anymore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so some of this money, sadly there won't be enough of it will help to defray and take some of that onus off of the back so that we can buy replacement parts, repair chillers and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's a win win. And Mayor, thank you for champing this and the city council, thank you for your support of this. And to all of you, it's it really is a game changer for for the city. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Goodwin. Miss Cantrell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. And Cantrell. And I wholly support the use of this hotel tax. However, I wish you had put in the measure that this extra 1% will go to the arts, will go to art education. As I read it, it says May and that all of this money goes into the general fund, just like the 10.25% sales'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tax does. And it's at the pleasure of the mayor and the council as to how it's spent. And I hope that when you come to budget time, you'll remember your pledge to all of these organizations that this money will be spent on the arts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Control. And I think like we passed the measure of resolution. That's why we're passing the Measure B resolution so that all the funds get spent where the resolution asked them to be spent. And so that's what that's what this agenda item is all about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you, Mr. Simon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, I'm Karen Deci, artistic director, producer of International City Theater.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'This request with you. I was asking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That you pass the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Which is a positive step in this city's evolution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A priority to the.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Paul Graham is executive director, producer for Musical Theater West. I'm going to let the kids speak for themselves. We reach about 17,000 kids, both bringing them into the theater at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center and going into schools, libraries and parks in each one of the nine city council districts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is after our pioneers of flight tours, which toured for two different weeks this past year. And it talks about the evolution of flight and aviators, and particularly women and African-American aviators. I just want to thank you for everything you do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This was an amazing show that you put on for us. I liked all of you guys singing voices. It was so cool that you have amazing voices. You guys taught me so much how to accomplish all my dreams and goals, even though I'm going through some tough things right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to thank you in case because I earned so I learned so many new things that we don't have to listen and give up. We can keep on going and don't let people tell it. Get into your dreams.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for setting up this show and for all the work. It was so fun and cool and creative and she was a third grader at Fremont Elementary School to musical theater. Wes, thank you for showing us the music and how fun it was to watching it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope we get to do it again. He came to see Carmody and I am thanking you for paying for the tickets and for our busses. And I'm so thankful because that was the kind of the show. It was so kind of you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your show was great. It had lights plus music, plus characters, and it was all my people and it was all on stage. My favorite part was when we met Jim met his neighbor and a teacher that's a friend of his when he moved to a new house to do some hard work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is from a special ed kid that the teacher said has refused to do any paperwork for six months. And this is the first thing he'd written. So arts education in the school is so important. Musical theater was totally supports it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I urge you all to as well. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Mr. Garman and Adam. And our final speaker is Miss Griselda Swartz.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much for having us here tonight. I want to start by relaying a message from one of our third graders at Edison Elementary. When we went in with our arts, education, supplies and lessons and curriculum. After the third week, these this third grader said this is better than recess.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The kind of impact that not only the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Arts Council of many of our partners that are here with us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tonight do in our classrooms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many of us serve the schools that don't have arts curriculum in their classrooms. And so supporting arts education and dedicating these funds to our arts organizations, our artist and our performing arts is so such an important part of our city fabric.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It really lets students know that their expression is important and their freedom of expression is important, and they can become civically engaged through that expression. So thank you so much for your support and for voting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On this measure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you for that. That concludes public comment. And I have a motion and a second councilmember pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to thank everybody for coming out today. Thank the mayor again for your leadership on this and the council members that worked on this. I have a couple of quick, brief questions similar to what I asked last time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Obviously, I fully support this. Last time this item was here shared some stats about how arts can really improve everything from science to math. I think it's a great program. Can you just share for us the next step?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So today we're doing a resolution just on broad spending. But what that next step is when we kind of hone in on a spending plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can share with I can I can answer that question. Sure. I think, Councilman, I think what we've been working on with staff is that similar to how the measure process went, the resolution was adopted. And then at some point in the near future, the as we did for Missouri, when the infrastructure plan came forward and there'",
        "'speaker_0': 'was an actual adoption by the council as to what projects and the amounts that will also a similar proposal from staff will come forward based on the resolution and the conversations with the Arts Council and the arts groups.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that will be voted on by the council at some point in the weeks ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. And I asked that question just because the conversation that we had last time also was around equity and making sure that we are looking at all the arts organizations, everything from music to painting to mural work and making sure that we are sharing this great new resource with all the organizations that do different types of art'",
        "'speaker_5': ', as well as ensuring that kids from our entire city get to benefit. One of the things we talked about last time was the equity toolkit. And I know that we've passed that as a as a council. We haven't had a presentation on it fully.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I would love if staff could work using that toolkit as they're thinking about those funding priorities. And think about that as you guys give that presentation to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Supporting this is just something that's so meaningful. I think it's important for us to keep in perspective what a small amount of money and a small percentage is going to go and how far it's going to go. I also think it's important that there's a lot of misinformation out there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Even tonight, someone said that 10.2% goes into the general fund, but actually only 2% of your 10.5% goes to Long Beach at all. And so I think it's just important that we keep everyone focused on what good things this could do for Long Beach kids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to thank the Council for consideration of this topic, and I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight in support of it. I have been a huge supporter of this concept from the outset, and I thank the mayor for his leadership in this regard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I am pleased to see some of the organizations that are called out specifically in the resolution. I think many of these organizations represent the heart of the arts, community and culture in the city of Long Beach. But in addition, I know there are a lot of other great organizations that would fall into, for example, the local'",
        "'speaker_4': 'museums and theaters. Language that's in here. So our ranchos are beautiful museums that celebrate the history of the city of Long Beach. We have a lot of local theaters that are, you know, smaller, a functioning playhouses where folks get an opportunity to get exposure to the arts that they otherwise might not have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they're trying to establish themselves. And and so I think this is fantastic. And I'm going to be not only voting in favor of this tonight, but personally, my family and I are going to be very supportive of of of this measure and look at the thoughts behind this measure and ensuring that the moneys that are collected'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with this measure, should it should it come to fruition, will be used in an appropriate manner. That's something that I intend to stay very connected on. So I thank you, Mr. Mayor, for this opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then as I closing, we go to the vote. I just want to add and I said this earlier, that the the the what this resolution really calls for is really historic funding for our arts organizations that have traditionally provided enormous amounts of arts education exhibits, performances across the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This resolution calls for what would be the most public funding the city has ever contributed to our arts organizations in the modern history of the city of Long Beach. And so we are absolutely. So when you talk when you talk about public funding of the arts, which is a absolute must, this this resolution is speaks to a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'historic level of funding that the city has never provided in the past. And so if voters obviously choose to adopt this and this resolution is in place, I think this council should should feel very, very, very good about this really historic step for the city and a transformational opportunity for all of these organizations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will also add that it's not just these organizations that are traditional larger arts groups, but I will add that the Arts Council, which is the really provider of funds and support for all of our smaller organizations, will also be receiving a significant boost in funding through this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so for those of us that support our mural programs and our small artists programs and cultural programing and these organizations that might be looser in nature, those will be funded also at historic levels as part of of of this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thank you to all the arts groups that are here. Members, please go ahead and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'"

    "Ordinance on Just Cause for Termination of Tenancies. ": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And thank you all for for being out here this evening. We've had a request to move up item 23, which is, I believe, a reading of the ordinance that was adopted at the last meeting. And so we will do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Item 23 is Communication from City Attorney Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to just cause for termination of tenancy and declaring the urgency thereof. Read the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading City Y.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Motorcar or Mr. Park. Any. Any reports?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Time. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, very quickly for your consideration as requested last week or as directed last week. Before you is the proposed ordinance, I think exactly in accord with what you asked me to do. Just to state what might already be self-evident by the council letter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are two ordinances attached. The first one is a clean ordinance which would be adopted if it passes tonight. The second one is a Red Lion, intended to show in easily readable contrast exactly how the ordinance that is before you tonight differs from AB 1482, otherwise known as the Tenant Protection Act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With that, I think the council letter is self-explanatory. I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Monica, do you have anything else to add to that or. I think we're ready right now. Councilman. And do you mind if I go to a public comment or did you want to speak first? Okay. We have ten speakers, which will be down to 90 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me take the first five speakers in this order. Not a Tushnet, Fred Sutton, Katie, Alma, Sandra Tommasini and Roberto Lopez. Please come forward in that order that a Tushnet, Fred Sutton, Katie Romer, Sandra Tommasini and Roberto Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name. Name's If I could talk. My name?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name's Nader Tushnet. I live in the third district. I fully support this. The hole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is very wide, and this closes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It. It doesn't create an extra.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Burden for anybody, but it does protect tenants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who are doing what they're supposed to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Paying the rent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Being responsible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it allows for rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Major rehabilitation, but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also demands that people show that they're going to do the rehabilitation. So I fully support this measure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Honorable City Council Mayor Fred Sutton with the California Apartment Association. Thank you council members and agents for meeting with us last week. But I do want to express our disappointment in the process. There were 72 hours before this was put on the agenda last week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was no real input. And something like this should go to at least some sort of a stakeholder meeting because there was no data provided and there is no indication anything has been done illegally. It's unfortunate because I think we could have found a way forward and we can still find a way forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It can take time, as was mentioned last week, for a permit to actually get processed. And now we're being told that once you get that permit, you have to you can't actually start work. You need to wait 60 days if everything goes smoothly to be able to start that work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That doesn't really seem to make sense. There could be another way forward to figure this out. A.B. 1482 has substantial legal remedies. There's noticing requirements already in there and there's mandatory relocation. Upgrading is very important for the housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I urge you to have a process that is not overly cumbersome and isn't designed to halt needed work. There is a middle ground here. If we just have discussions on it, I don't think this is something needs to be Rush.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I share the same goals. We do not want anything illegal being done. We want things to be done appropriately. But this is going to cause issues when someone's ready to begin work. It makes a lot of sense sometimes for it to actually be vacant before you get that permit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can find a way forward. Appreciate you listening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Sutton. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Keep the comma. I wanted to thank you all again for moving this forward and being able and listening at our original tenant meeting. We had someone stand up and say, What? You're going to city council? That's not going to do any good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They won't do anything. And I said, You just wait. We have our neighbors on city council who understand what we're going through. So I thank you all for for listening and taking action on this and to the point that the gentleman just made.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It doesn't really make any sense to me that you want people out before you get your permits. Isn't it better to be collecting the rent that's going to pay for those permits before you apply for the permits, rather than waiting and then having to wait another 6 to 8 weeks with nobody in the apartment before you can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'start to do any work. If you get the permit in advance, soon as somebody is out, you can start, which seems to make a lot more sense. But I just wanted to say thank you and also bring to attention that in this ordinance there is an expiration date in 2030.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I didn't understand why that's there, what purpose that serves that we have to go through this again in ten years. So if maybe if somebody could address that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, I'm Sandra Tommasini. I know all of you have heard from me, all of your offices. I want to thank you for your support last week on this. I know you've heard from me again because I also take issue with the expiration date on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'SB 1482 doesn't expire. I'm not really sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why this does are as much fun as this has been for all of us. Don't really want to go through it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again ten years from now. But if it's nothing over ten years, I'll take the ten years. And yeah I agree that there with Kate that there's really not an argument for. Not having to have permits beforehand. Permits take time to get.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can be getting rental income in the meantime. And again, it's just holding landlords and owners accountable for actually having the money to do these substantial renovations for actually. Going through the process of doing this has potential motivations and is not leaving it to the tenant to, after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Somehow go through the civil court system to get.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A remedy if it doesn't actually happen. So I think it's fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That this is going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To be voted on tonight. I hope that you're going to continue to give your support to it. And again, thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please, Roberto Lopez. And before Mr. Lopez goes, if I can have the next final five speakers. Those are Lopez, Jordan Wynn, Max Norris, believe it says Anki Zwirner Curtis and Mike Murchison. If those folks can please line up at the podium.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. LAWRENCE Hello, everybody. Councilmembers and mayor, thank you so much for your support on this. And all we're doing is just clarifying the law and addressing one of the loopholes on AP 1482. I do appreciate the bold step and helping protect the tenants in the city of Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Cases of folks with 60 day notices. And, you know, I'm open to working with any offices and providing some of the addresses, if that's something that folks want to look at. You know, 40 is way too many, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's 40 plus like the people that live in there, the kids that I have to go through, the stress that the parents are passing on to them. And, you know, the you know, owners can actually go into the units and look at what needs to get done as long as they get proper notice.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think they're taking this step. What we're doing is just clarifying the law. And I appreciate you for doing this. And on behalf of Ray, you know, thank you so much and have a good one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Lisa Lopez and I am a Proud Dissector resident. I moved to Long Beach in August to continue my studies in CSO B and it didn't take long for me to fall in love with the city and its people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would love to continue to live and grow in the city and would be sad and to have to move to another city due to an unjust eviction. I know there has been an ask for data and as we know, that data is not available, nor does it reflect the realities of tenants who have been evicted and'",

        "'speaker_2': 'To thank you and ask you to continue to support and pass item number 23 of the agenda to help protect not only myself, but my neighbors as well. I was here last Tuesday and was proud to see the amount of support that this item received from you all and from community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Members that were here as well and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those who cannot make it. Thank you for your time and I truly hope that our voices, stories and love for the city are taken into account when making your decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker Jordan Wynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi there. Jordan Wynn, District two resident I stand here in support of item 23. I want to thank you all for last week. Taking the unanimous step on helping enforce the letter of the law of the land of California and helping make sure that we clarify and keep families safe and keep families home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to keep this short. I really am looking forward to another unanimous passage on this, and I'm hoping that we continue to protect all of our residents across the city. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Norris.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good afternoon, counsel. Mr. Mayor. I usually speak from a general place of ethics and morals when I come up here, but this weekend I had a very personal experience with this law that was very disturbing. I was looking for an apartment and I went to speak to an individual renting a space on 10th just near the supermarket'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there. Just what is that, west of Long Beach Boulevard. And there was some kids playing outside. They were a little rowdy. I had no problem with that. But he seemed to think that I did and assured me that they were being evicted and that they wouldn't be an issue once I took possession, if I were to make'",
        "'speaker_3': ', you know, to be in this unit, I dug around a little bit and play devil's advocate with him. And this was how he was doing it. He didn't have permits. He was just going to paint the apartment, you know, and he was evicting a family.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It looked like at least two, three very young kids, two of them running around in diapers. And he didn't seem to have any qualms with it. Now, I understand that people are buying a property and seeking an investment here, but the role of the government is to protect the people who are the weakest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's not being done here in Long Beach. And it may be too late, I think, but some action late is better than nothing. I would support taking the ten year cap off of it and moving forward as a small step towards bigger steps in the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thank you for your support on this measure. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And are the last two speakers to support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did. Mayor Garcia. Dear Congresswoman and a councilwoman and councilman. Sorry. I just moved into that city. I've been working at UCLA and USC, and I wish I could stand here with my husband, who was a history teacher at Cal State Long Beach for 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He cannot be here because he's teaching. He has class tonight. And we're very supporters of the arts in that city. But we've been kicked out of our apartment. Just last week, we carried boxes from A to B because we found a new place, which is nice, but not all of our neighbors had the same possibility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would also would like to come back to what was discussed beforehand, that we have to spend a lot more money for our new apartment, which we would like to spend for L.A. Opera or Long Beach Opera, Long Beach theaters and culture.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we cannot, because we have to spend it on rent. So the first thing we discuss or you discuss today goes along was what we're discussing right now. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much on our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, mayor and council members. My name is Mike Murchison. I'm here on behalf of the Small Property Owners Alliance and the Apartment Association. I want to call your attention. It's under the red line that Rich Anthony called out if you have a chance to look at it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So on page six of your red line document, I'm asking for you folks to consider kind of a balanced approach here, something that is a level playing field, especially for the rental property owners who got hit with this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The thing I'm looking for is if you look at under it's page six, under two D, it talks about reasonably detailed information needs to be provided to the tenants. Who decides what's reasonably? Whose definition is it of reasonably?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It goes on to say why it cannot be reasonably accomplished in a safe manner with the tenant in place. Who decides that? Is that the city of Long Beach? Is that code enforcement? Is it a civil remedy? The final one, it talks about why it requires a tenant to vacate for at least 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, what if a tenant disagrees with what you determine is substantial renovation right now in the city of Long Beach, you get a permit it last 90 days. There is no way if you put this on the books that that permit is going to be valid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's going to expire. Yes. Development services will tell you that you can get an extension. You can't get that extension. From what my understanding is online, you've got to come down to city hall. How many times does a rental property need to come down to City Hall?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I ask you to please look at page six on that red line and ask yourself who is the final arbiter? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman in House.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you all for coming and speaking on this item. I do have some questions that I would like clarification on. Right now, we have a moratorium on evictions covered, covering all notices since January 1st.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that true?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember. Technically, technically, that's not true. Last week you did not take an action which prohibited notices. But if this passes. But that's a technicality. If this passes tonight, then all pending notices as of tonight will be null and void retroactive to January one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for that clarification. Also, I have had a lot of residents contact my office about the notices and to vacate that they are expecting, you know, expiring very shortly within the next couple weeks and beginning of March.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Before this item gets hurt the second time. So. What can be done about that. So it's kind of my second question. Is that answered by your your answer to my first question?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, I think if I understand you correctly, you mentioned a second reading of this ordinance. If the urgency component of this ordinance, which will be done via a separate vote, if that passes tonight, five votes, then there will be no second reading.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will be immediately effective as of today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, customer Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Again, thank you, everybody, for coming out and speaking tonight. I have two very quick questions. One on the the comments made by Mr. Merchants and on who decides. That's a judge that decides. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, that's my understanding, the way that it's written. You take issue with what's reasonably. We tried to get some general language in there which provided some detail, but not too much where it would be onerous. You're right. Ultimately, it would be up to a justice of the superior court handling unlawful detainers to determine whether the notice was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'valid or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wonderful. And then can you just give us some clarity on the expiration date?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Notwithstanding what the speaker said, it caused me to question myself for a second, but I just looked up the log in 1482 Section 1940 6.2 J of the Civil Code clearly states that it sunsets January one, 2030.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. So we've taken the state. We've barely touched this, just closing that one gap. So really thank you, colleagues, for the unanimous vote last week. I hope that we can count on the same today. And thank you, everybody, for being.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Engaged on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do have a question for Miss Tatum this this period of time that the permit is good for. I know the extensions can be given, but is it possible to extend that period of time from 90 days to maybe 120 days?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What would that entail? What impacts would that have if we were to modify that in terms of this discussion? Or if you're talking about a code amendment, that would be a separate amendment that would have to come back to the city council for consideration.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would just just give you a little bit of background. That time period, let me just repeat reiterate last week's discussion about the process. The in reality, the practices that once a permit is issued, staff generally assumes that they have a six month time period within which to act on that permit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Technically, the code does state 90 days. However, it doesn't hit anybody's radar until six months. And at that point in time, if any applicant needs an extension staff very freely. Grants extensions. It's never been an issue with anyone requesting and receiving an extension of a building permit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the purpose behind having that 90 days, which was changed, I'm going to say a couple of building permit cycles ago because the city felt that there was an interest in once a permit is pulled rather than having a building being in a condition of disrepair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city council asked that that number be reduced from the previous six months in the code to 90 days in order to have a lever to try to help move projects along in term, and so that they don't sit in a state of disrepair for a lengthy period of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And again, in practice, staff has always been extremely flexible in granting extensions on any building permit. But to answer your question briefly, it would require a change to the to the city's municipal code to extend that time from the current 90 day time period to 180 days or any other time period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So thank you for that clarification. It makes a lot of sense to me. So what I'm hearing you say is that although the code has the permit be in existence for 90 days, our custom and practice is to not initiate any enforcement action or contact until six months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we would because the code requires 90 days. We would obviously respond to complaints if if for some reason our property there was nothing happening on a property that 90 days had expired. So we will be reactive, but we won't necessarily be proactive unless that six month period has passed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then the purpose of shortening it from six months to 90 days was it's probably a bad analogy, but just to keep a shorter leash so that we can go in and give a gentle nudge to keep things moving along.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct. Is there any way that we can make the extension process more user friendly? Can we make that an online application? That is something that we are currently exploring and I'm certainly willing to look into that in a little bit more detail and bring something back to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So I think if if it's. Would that require another reading? Mr.. Anthony. If we requested that that if I offer that as a friendly to come back to council as a TFF.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, we certainly can't make any changes to 18.0 4.060 tonight. It wasn't agenda ized, but if you want to request that as a friendly or a substitute to direct to council or sorry staff to bring something back, you can write.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't want to amend the ordinance, but I do want to request the TFF. So what would be the best way to do that without having to notice it as a separate item at a future meeting?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can just give the direction tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I'd like to give that direction if unless there's any objection from my colleagues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you. I may, first of all, like to think, Councilwoman Cynthia, to bringing this item forward, because this week I made some house calls with the Long Beach, you know, housing and and my residents, the sixth District was being displaced under this significant improvement clause.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I checked these permits and denim had been pulled. And you can tell that some of these places I've already was able to visit, they were already being vacated. And so with that, I just wanted to let you know that these things sometimes people think that this really is not the truth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I have one of my residents here in the audience, because the fact that he was in one of those situations where you had the eviction notices given to you. But all I can tell you that I think that this clause, that's what we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know it fits. And I think it's a good clause that we really need to be using. So I just want to let the housing of Long Beach. I'm just glad that they were their words when they see that these things are really going on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just hope that we continue to keep up the fight. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Supernormal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just wanted a little bit of clarification on Councilwoman Price's amendment here or motion. Would this be all encompassing as far as what comes back? The earliest meeting would be March 10th, I think is the next time we meet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But would we be able to look at everything on this, like whether or not we should change the timeframe? Are we looking at specifics on this? Well, let me just first say, my understanding of the friendly in Councilmember Price can correct me if I'm wrong was effectively the motion on the floor is to adopt staff's recommendation but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to direct I'm sorry the ordinance that was brought back but to ask staff to bring back a24 from memo at some point in the near future which wouldn't really come back before the council in a meeting. It would just be a TFF a memo to the council members regarding the status of online permit extensions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just allowing people to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So thank you for that clarification. So we're not talking about an extension of days we have here. What we have is practice, but the letter of the law is 90 days. If anyone ever wanted to enforce that, that's my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's my understanding of what's before you right now as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Councilmember, we can add in the two from four if it helps for clarity purposes what the process is right now that you're explaining that we give six months time to be able to before we start initiating that so that there's some written record, that that's our practice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's exactly what I'm asking for. So thank you for that clarification. Oh, dear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate the clarification. I was supportive of Councilwoman Price's friendly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So memo appears. Bush and Kerry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need two motions of urgency and then the substance. So. So in case it wasn't clear that motion was on the urgency of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a second motion now. I just need a second on that motion. And members. Bruce Gordon Caster.'",

This process was facilitated by environment, architecture, a local architectural firm and with the support of Tasha Hunter of Hunter Wiggins'",

The other contracting consultant supported the institutional development process and this was the second component where the Community Advisory Committee was convened to develop an operating vision for the cultural center informed by the community input and subject matter experts.'",

Seven focus groups with the civic organizations, and 18 stakeholder interviews with prominent members of the community.

Throughout this past year, the advisory committee worked to develop an independent organization that will carry on the work of creating an African-American cultural center. This was one of the challenges at at the beginning of the process we did there was not an actual organization for us as a city staff to'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And I also want to thank our councilman's councilmembers in the House for bringing this forward. We've noticed food trucks throughout the community, and I think they have a right to be here as well because they are small, small businesses and entrepreneurs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think we do need direction and can provide some direction in terms of where they are they're located so that they're not competing, as councilmember said, with with existing businesses, particularly in those business districts that we have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have business districts that are set up that restaurants are paying assessments and business licensing fees to to be. And it's it's not fair. And so but I do think we do have areas in our city where food trucks can drive.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's parties and hours in which they can thrive as well, because I love going to them after hours. And there's all restaurants are closed, there's a food truck available. You get some of the best food in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that said, I think we should be thoughtful about that. And then using food trucks to creatively program areas that they may not have activity currently. And so that would just be my direction. I would like to see some vision.'",

If you could look at how the oversize vehicle ordinance applies to these vehicles in a situation near the traffic circle where it was a restricted area and I don't recall the exact number, but I believe they got 40 parking tickets that was obviously being treated'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I would just hope that we could also expand it to any area that has a business association, whether it's a formalized organization or not. Those businesses have already worked together as well and faced similar challenges, though they have not yet been together as a bid.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. I don't see any public comment on this, but I do want to just add a few things that I think, Mr. Monaco, you and I have talked about this topic before, and I'm very interested in it as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me I just want to start just saying that I appreciate councilman's in the house for bringing this forward. I think this is really important. I think, one, food trucks bring an important diversity of food and selection and opportunity for people to enjoy really great food experiences.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I absolutely support them. Some food trucks are providing, I think, unique dining experiences where there is no food being offered at certain times of the day. I think of this Mexican truck, for example, that's on the corner of I think it's PCH and Atlantic that has just created a whole new, interesting public space at night where'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they have tables out front, they have lights, there's people out congregating. So from a a public space perspective, there are food trucks that are creating unique public spaces in Long Beach and are activating public corridors that I completely support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I want to make sure that as we are looking at these regulations, that we're thinking about these these spaces and these trucks that are activating our corridors at night and creating, in my opinion, even safer streets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the same time, I would agree that we have in in some occasions some trucks that are parking literally in front of businesses and really damaging that business without having the same set of rules to follow. And so I am very interested in that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some of the topics that I hope you look into, Mr. Modica. One is what exactly is the permitting process? Is there a permitting process? And I'd like to understand that when that comes back to the Council, I'd like to also understand some food trucks actually have lighting and signage that we don't even allow in our municipal code'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so what I mean by that is I can think of one in particular that I have mentioned to the city in many occasions that has such a bright and. Powerful light and signage that is not even allowed in our code yet glares into apartments and homes right across from where they park on a nightly basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it is really a quality of life issue for those residents that if they were a brick and mortar, would not be allowed to have that level of signage. And to me, that is really important that we look at that piece of it as part of this permitting process is the lighting and signage on the trucks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would also hope that we take into consideration some food trucks have a partnership relationship with brick and mortar stores. So, for example, we just have we just had a new cider cider open up here on Third Street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cider works and they bring in a food truck on regular occasion to park in front of their cider shop. Now to provide food as folks are drinking beer and cider inside. And so I want to make sure that we're acknowledging that there are important partnerships that do form with brick and mortars, and that those partnerships are also'",
        "'speaker_0': 'part of what we're exploring in this regulation. So thank you to Councilman. And because I think this is I'm glad we're finally going to kind of take a look at this because it's kind of been out there. We haven't really nailed down kind of what the regulations are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I look forward to this information coming back is just going to come back in a report or an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So our plan was to come back first with a lot of those questions. We have a lot of those similar questions. This is a difficult area for us. It touches multiple different departments. It touches the county as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we'd like to really we're pulling the team together to understand this. Should this pass tonight, we'll come back with a lot of these questions and eventually we will need an ordinance. So if we're looking to implement any of these things, we'll make a recommendation on where we think the council is going.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this discussion is very helpful tonight and eventually you would be approving an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like if Councilman Sunday houses is amenable it I would hope because I think this topic is so important to so many people up here and it's really a quality of life issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I like this report and all these questions that come back to the council, whether it's in the form of an ordinance or a report that we here at the council instead of just a memo before we take that next step.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sure we'd probably put it all in writing, put in a memo, and then we'd be happy to come bring a presentation and see if we've got it right on where we're headed. And then we can then get direction to do the ordinance from there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that could be part of the motion. That would be that would be great. Okay, great. And then so we have a motion in the second. Please go ahead. And Castro notes. I don't have any public comment on this item unless no public comments.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And there could be play year round. Eldorado Park uses reclaimed water. This cannot be used to cool or wash artificial turf. So I'm assuming that the 1.5 million is going to pay for a new sprinkler system. Also, the plan includes boulders around the size of the field to keep out bikes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are a hazard for play for soccer players. Long Beach Unified is putting artificial turf in all the high schools and many middle schools. NYS O should be allowed to use these fields on weekends. Plastic is bad for the environment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It shreds and washes into the gutters and storm drains which go into the ocean. And disposable of these feel the spoils of these feels after 5 to 7 years when they're no longer usable is becoming a huge problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are better uses for this 1.5.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Control. Mislead. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm also pleased to see there is a surplus this year. Let's see. Where am I? Here. Okay. If we have surplus funds, they should be spent on bringing back the police and doing the street maintenance. That was what was originally promised with Measure eight funds or the two things that people are most interested in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you look at what we've gotten back for that money, we only have 22 officers funded, 19 of those positions filled and three of the positions being used for overtime. But GLASSIE Mailer said 200 less police equals a lay, a less safe Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's true. So I'm pleased to say that the police academy is going to be funded. But what I don't like is looking at the transactions and the use tax spreadsheet that shows that there's 22 million going into public safety maintenance in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Public safety maintenance was defined for me by the Finance Department as being wages and compensation for existing officers, not new hires. So I feel like the people didn't get anything for that 22 million that was supposed to have come out of the original general fund streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you look at street maintenance, we only used 15% of the money that has come through so far on streets and that's looking at mobility. 43 million of the 222 million received since inception. And that's another thing that I hear repeated over and over again by the people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's see if we have more funds. I'm also opposed to the artificial turf soccer field, mainly because I'm a part of of the group, the Friends of Eldorado Park East. And we've submitted extensive documentation on what's needed at Eldorado Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have big maintenance issues. We have non ADA compliance and we have dangerous conditions. I personally fell in November trying to take a picture of it. So, you know, it's that's for real in terms of visioning this artificial turf soccer field seems to me like it's another case of commercializing park space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The real beneficiary of it is the air. So contractor, not the kids, not the players. So if we're going to do visioning, we should include the neighborhoods. There haven't been any outreach meetings on this that I know of in six years on this artificial turf soccer field.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we're going to be doing I've also seen the RFP where there's additional commercial enterprise being sought. And right now there's 12,000 people have signed a survey for Save the Parks having looked at this. Thank you. So it's serious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next week, police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council members and city staff. My name is John Schulze.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm a 19 year resident of Council District five. I'm chairman of Play Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which stands.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For Parkland Advocates for Youth. Play Long Beach was formed to partner with the city and its playground projects. Our next being Long Beach's first all inclusive playground built in Eldorado West. Not too far from the proposed turf field.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I look forward to working with all of you on this and other future projects. I'm also an Eldorado Park annual pass holder, but spend most of my time outside the gates with my 11 year old son, JT at Eldorado West.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm here to advocate. For the proposed state of the art artificial turf playing field. It's beautiful, thoughtful, accessible and safe. Design would be a major improvement to the current rundown space. Our youngest residents deserve a quality field to learn, play and compete on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've spoken to leaders of local youth organizations, and their members are overwhelmingly in favor of this project. This includes my family. Other local residents who support and appreciate the investments our local leaders continue to make. I'd also like to note that the Parks and Rec Commission also voted to approve this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In closing play Long Beach not only builds playgrounds, we also support quality, open play spaces for our youth. We support and encourage. Your approval for and construction of the proposed artificial turf field at Eldorado Park West. Thank you for the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's really been an honor. First time speaking in this big room. Thank you. Let me address you this evening. And for your part in making Long Beach a better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Place to play.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In live.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. Mr. Motorcade had a couple questions. Maybe a park staff wants to answer, if you can answer, because I've had a number of conversations with parents and kids that play extensively on the other fields that we've installed in our other parks are artificial, and in fact, they are heavily used, heavily welcomed'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I constantly get parents and young kids asking to install more of these fields across the city. The school district is putting in these fields all across the school district and have been they've been wildly successful as far as I can tell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also know that the kids are playing a WYSO at El Dorado are are a complete reflection of what the city looks like and the parents and the kids involved are looking for more places to play. The one thing that I've always believed in when it comes to Parks and I and and I said this oftentimes at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the Coastal Commission when we talked about park space in the coastal zone, is that to really activate our public spaces, including parks, you have to create spaces that people want to come to and that people want to enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And oftentimes it's passive space and it's open space, and often times it's rethinking our spaces to ensure that we're bringing in young people that can experience the types of activities and sports and and and and interactions that encourage them to wants to be within that space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the fact that this addition to Eldorado Park, in my opinion, is going to bring a lot of new people to that site and a lot of young people and a lot of young kids that are reflective of this entire city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we think that's probably the case?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can have Steve talk about more of the specifics, but I absolutely believe that that's the case. We have seen several of these being done. This has been about a five year program where we started this concept. We actually started it at Eldorado Park was one of the first discussions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And but we've moved throughout the city. I want to remind everyone that this park was actually originally funded. And then because we did additional community outreach and discussion, we actually delayed it and the council member actually donated those funds or said we can move on and do the ones in the other areas, the cities that we have'",
        "'speaker_8': 'constructed, many of these, they are very well used. Now this is coming back in and creating the one in Eldorado Park. We do hear from the users that they love them, that they are fantastic. We again, we went with a Corgan sand model rather than some of the chrome rubber, which definitely helps with the heaters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't have that black material that sometimes can can warm up. And so the one thing to remember is when you have fields, you have to take them down for maintenance. So having a field like this up has it the ability to have much more play all the time rather than having to take it down for maintenance'",
        "'speaker_8': 'as much. So I will ask Steve if he has anything else to add, but we think your comments are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Spot on and. Mr.. Exactly. Mr. SCOTT. I know that these this field work will actually ensure longer play and longer use of the space because you don't have to actually tear it down or replace the field over, over multiple months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if the goal here is to activate the park more and bring more children from across the city and more users of all types to the park, this is going to achieve that, in my opinion. If the goal is to not do that and to keep the space more passive and maybe not encourage these young kids'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to come to the park, then we can continue to not create these additional types of spaces in across the city. So I strongly support this effort and I also really want to thank Councilwoman Mongo for spearheading this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been something she's been working on for, for many years, and I would go beyond just that, that we need to continue these types of creative uses. I believe that soccer and those that play soccer currently is the height.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have the highest need and requests for more soccer fields across the city right now in our public and park spaces. Is that correct, Mr. Scott?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor, members of the city council soccer is probably our largest sport in terms of play, in terms of play both at the youth level and the adult level. And we have four artificial turf fields already in our rotation in the city, and we have heard nothing but positive comments about those spaces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As the acting city manager mentioned. It allows for greater playability because we don't have to take the fields down for maintenance to keep the fields safe. We would need to take them down for six week periods at a time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With artificial turf fields, we don't need to do that. That downtown downtime, maintenance. And we'll be able to use those fields year round. And so certainly it provides for greater playability, but it also provides a safer playing environment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it was mentioned earlier about gopher holes on fields. And, you know, that's something that artificial turf fields really help us avoid are some of those trip and fall injuries. And so certainly we are excited about the opportunity for a field for artificial turf because it's a safer environment and it allows for greater playability in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a sport that is growing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it reminds me of the discussion that we had, for example, over the additional running, walking on the beach or adding additional active space. And in places that maybe have been passive, there is absolutely a place and a time to to preserve a complete passive space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there's also an opportunity for us to bring more people to that space and activate them in new ways, particularly with young kids. And so I'm very supportive of that. And I thank you guys for your work on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Marengo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Mary and I have an artificial field in my district in the Advocate Park, and I like to thank the EEOC and more specifically, Councilwoman Mungo, because she sacrificed her field before I got mine. And I can attest to the fact that that field is used from daylight to day night to nighttime.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And rise to something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Still too dark. And it's been utilized a lot. And I think that it's been basically a a nothing but a positive influence on what went on in the West Long Beach area, especially with these kids who want to play soccer and also for the adult teams as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So a very supportive of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I just want to clarify that measure A and the promises of Measure A have consistently, year after year been fulfilled. The promises that this diocese, this board made were for infrastructure and public safety and maintaining our parks and libraries are as important as our streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You will hear me at community meeting after community meeting, fighting for streets, streets, street streets. But one of the frustrating things about street repair is it's a long planning process and we can only do so many streets a year because there are only so many asphalt vendors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm very fortunate that the fifth District has had nearly 200 streets repaired, but we were also double the detriment of other streets in other districts. So I think the next close is at the time when I was elected was Councilmember Oranga with about $20 million in street repair need and I was at $40 million that I inherited'",
        "'speaker_6': 'from my predecessor. Additionally, in relation to the extensive amount of maintenance and repairs needed at Eldorado Park, both west and east, I've consistently helped form friends groups I have consistently requested, and the groups to maintain a list of their needs and the items on the lists that are easily identifiable and maintained and communicated to our office have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'been funded. We're doing a $2 million duck pond restoration and enhancement. We've replaced and funded new tables. There were 40 tables identified throughout the park that were in disrepair. I went to one of the friends group meetings and proposed where we should place them and talked about the different strategies on how we could repair other benches throughout'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the park. I'm not using injury funds, but using council district funds for something that was on their list. And then the 100,000 in filtration pumps that were allocated tonight with this vote, that will be helpful. And then millions of dollars throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But several of them will be for park bathrooms in Eldorado Park done this summer. So that's about $6 million in investment in just Eldorado Park, east and west. And that is with a list that's just not maintained as actively as some of our other groups like Play.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one of the things that that's very helpful is when a group like Play or Friends of Wardlow Park get together and keep a list. When funds become available, it's really easy to find out. This is a small dollar amount.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What small dollar amount items can we make significant progress on very quickly? Even so much as say that it's been almost a year and we allocated over $10,000 for trashcan lids, but the group hasn't really come together on what solution they want yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so those moneys are kind of tied up. So I look forward to meeting with those groups again potentially as early as this Friday. But I hope my colleagues will support moving forward on these items tonight because the community, as I have heard them, are in huge support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you very much for that support and and your leadership on many things in the city. John.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, there's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Motion carries. When do we think this project will start? But in a few weeks. The the artificial turf in Eldorado Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm turning to our partners in public works to see how quickly we can start. I know there's still the funding vote that's going to be required coming up shortly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, it's about 30 seconds away for that funding vote.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we'll get back to you on when that will be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had heard it would be about six weeks. Is that correct? Okay. Okay, great. So then how long is that going to be? Mr. Modica and Apr.'"
