        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. And I know our public works director made a note as well. I saw him actively writing. Great. So thank you for that. I'm going to go back to the hearing, Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. The staff report will be given by Linda Tatum and her group.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor, and members of the city council. This is a public hearing for a project. It located at 2610 North Lakewood Boulevard. It is a project for a new hotel. And the the subject hotel is at 2016, North Lakewood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it also includes properties at 41, 41 through 4217 Willow Street. The actions that we're asking the city council to take on this new hotel proposal include a conditional use permit, a site plan review, and to accept a mitigated negative declaration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like to give a brief presentation on the project. This is a vicinity map that shows the current zoning of the property and the location. What you're seeing there is the four or five freeway at the Lakewood Street Interchange and shown in green there with the arrow is the proposed project site at the site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is a a an existing gas station that is adjacent to the hotel which surrounds the gas station at that northeast corner of Lakewood and Willow Street. I'd also bring to your attention on the other side, on the west side of Lakewood Boulevard, there is an existing commercial car wash and retail establishment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next. As I said on this project site, the proposal is a new 13 storey in an existing Holiday Inn 13 storey, but also is a vacant two storey hotel that was constructed back in 1978. The proposal before you tonight is the approval of the requested discretionary actions that will allow the existing two storey hotel to be demolished'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And they would construct a new six storey hotel and a new two level parking structure on the site where the existing two storey hotel is to be demolished. So again, the entitlements are requested that are being requested are a zone change, a site plan review and a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just a little bit of background. The zone change is to request an expansion of the existing PD 27 zoning on the adjacent property. That existing PD covers the site that shown to the left there in black. And that's essentially a plan development project that allows hotel and limited commercial retail in that project area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The proposal is to expand that PD 27 to include the subject property on the right that's shown in the red, which would be the subject of the new hotel site. And again, the the existing property owners have for not only the hotel site, but the gas station as well as the property adjacent on the other side, on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the west side of Lakewood have approved consented to the requested zone change. A little bit of detail about the proposed project. It is a new six story hotel project with 125 GUESTROOMS. It also has some amenities. Those amenities include additional conference room space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is also a new fitness facility in the in the hotel room there also including a new a new parking structure that will be atop the existing at grade parking. So it will essentially be a two level parking structure for a total with a total of 385 parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They will also add a new outdoor pool area and enhance the existing landscaping on the site and around the entire property. This next slide shows the configuration of the site. You can see the existing the round building is the existing Holiday Inn that will remain and you can see the configuration of the parking just to the east'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of that. You can also see the enhanced the green areas of the enhanced landscaping areas. You also see that they are requesting the closure of one of the driveways on Willow. And you can again see the two level parking structure and of course, the location of the outdoor pool, which is just north of the existing Holiday Inn'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And again, just briefly, you can see the building elevations, the six stories. They've you can see the modern architectural style with the two tones of the color and the accent banding and the spaniel class that surrounds the property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been designed to complement the existing Holiday Inn structure or to complemented. Also like to just summarize the environmental action that was done on this project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act. We staff completed, along with a consultant, we completed a mitigated negative declaration for the project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The public review period was from November 16th through December 16th, and staff did receive a couple of comments from public agencies during that review period. And there were two mitigation measures incorporated in the project. Those two mitigation measures dealt with cultural resources, requiring monitoring of any of any disturbance of the soil on the project site and observance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or having monitoring done by Indian tribes. The other mitigation that was required was related to any disturbance of the soil during the excavation and that no construction or other soil disturbance would be carried out during breeding season to make sure that there are no nesting birds on the site at the time construction occurs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those were the two mitigation measures, and with those mitigation, the Planning Commission considered this project on December or I'm sorry, January 19th of 2017, and they unanimously recommended approval of this project. And staff is recommending that the City Council uphold the Planning Commission's recommendation for approval of this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would note that we had there were no public comments during the the period since this project has been posted online. And I would like to acknowledge that closes staff's presentation. But we do have our environmental consultant available as well as the case planner, Gina Cassius, who did the work on this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That concludes staff's presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, I think, for that presentation. We're going to go ahead and go first to any public comment on this case. No public comment on this issue and the council comments. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. We are very excited about this project. I know that it has been in the works for several years and it has taken a few different. Changes along the way, but we're very excited to have this new opportunity and additional places for people to stay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is very difficult to find a room on the east side near the airport now with the amount of business that's going on. And we're very proud to have our new corporate partners and our corporate partners do trainings from individuals all across America and sometimes international, and they come to Long Beach to be trained.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so these are great facilities for them to stay at, especially for those longer term stays, especially for their trainer. So we're excited about this project. Thank you for the work that's been done both by the team at Holiday Inn and the support that they've received from the Convention and Visitors Bureau and the support that they've received'",
        "'speaker_1': 'from the city staff to make this a fair and balanced project that takes all needs into consideration. I think we have come up with a solution that meets everyone's needs. So if you haven't made it there to see the first revision, we did a ribbon cutting for the Holiday Inn tower several months ago, and I look forward'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to a groundbreaking and ribbon cutting for this facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council member Supernormal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. This area of the fifth District borders the fourth and has kind of a quirky sense because our border is is the four or five freeway. But in this one section, the border changes to Willow Street for a couple of hundred yards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the property is in the fifth District. But a lot of my constituents ask me about this all the time. I just wanted to ask staff. I know during a construction period, especially something of this magnitude, you would meet with the police department and work out the September requirements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And September is an acronym that stands for Crime Prevention through Environmental Design. And prior to construction starting this, these meetings will take place and you work out all the details. And our police department or in particular has its Espinosa officer in East Division, would work with the construction firm to make sure all security measures are in place'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Yes. Council member of the the police department during the course of the site plan review for this project and every other development project, the plans are related to the police department. So PD has had the chance to review the plans prior to their being finalized and they had did provide comments to staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those comments have been reflected in the project design. However, it is generally my understanding that police may also be involved during the construction process just for general monitoring of the site as necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Perfect. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. There's a motion in a second. Just want to make sure. For the planning staff. Just a note that the. The tower. The current tower has obviously a a lighting scheme that's pretty bright, which I know they've changed and upgraded recently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which is which is fine. I just want to make sure that the new building that we're paying attention to, what the lighting is going to be for the new building, and so that the two are not in conflict, but that the lighting the lighting scheme is looks great both at night and during the day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly they are. We can make sure that that gets addressed so that they are compatible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. We need four separate votes on this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. So we'll go in. We have we're going to take four separate votes. We've done public comment for the whole item. And so we have the first of those votes as a motion. In a second, please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Motion passes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. You can just please plug in for the second motion to this. You want to read this? Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Decker to declare ordinance amending the zoning district map.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Pleased that the motion to second Castro votes.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And now we're going to do we'll come back to 16 in just a minute. We are going to go ahead and do item number 24. Believe it is. Hold on 1/2. It is. Yep. Item 24.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A report from the Police Department recommendation to execute all documents necessary to enter into a contract with L.A. Metro to provide law enforcement services in an amount not to exceed 30 million districts one, two, six, seven and eight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Think you're going to make some some comments and then I might turn this over to our our chief of police to also make some some comments. So I want to, first of all, obviously thank the Lombard City Council for their unanimous support of doing this contract with with L.A. Metro.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That happened, I know, a few weeks ago. As we as we now know, L.A. Metro has contracted with the Long Beach Police Department to for the first time be able to patrol our own metro system. The blue line here in Long Beach beginning this summer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Long Beach Police Department will be transitioning into full jurisdictional control of the Long Beach Blue Line and all eight stations, as well as the the route between each station across the entire city of Long Beach, from old from north Long Beach, all the way through until the downtown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to just note that this is an incredibly significant moment for the city of Long Beach. We are not only gaining a $30 million contract, which which is obviously exciting, but this will be 30 approximately 30 new police.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'FTE.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Personnel added to the Long Beach Police Department. And it's not every day that this council will get to vote on adding 30 new police officers to the Long Beach Police Department. These 30 officers will make up what will be a Long Beach metro detail for the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there will they will be assigned to the the Metro Division. We know I certainly know as a councilman that there are a lot of challenges on the blue line. It is not a safe experience for for most folks that that choose to write it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's both a problem of safety and a problem of perception of safety when it comes to the Long Beach blue line. And so I know that our Long Beach police officers, our chief, are going to do a fantastic job of not just patrolling the blue line, but the synergy that will be created, as are patrolling the areas'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up and down. The blue line is going to be something that is going to be pretty great to see. And so I want to I want to ask the chief to say a few words. And I also ask the chief to invite his team that helped work on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was a incredibly difficult effort. A lot of manpower went behind this on from the chief's team. This was not an easy to get to. To get to the vote and where it went. And so I want to congratulate our chief of police for his leadership on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want him to also introduce his team who did a fantastic job. And so let's give our chief of police and his team a big round of applause for their work. And, Chief, congratulations. You've just expanded both your force and your area of patrol.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Mr. Chief.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. Any time something of at this level happens, it's so great. It is a team effort and it does start with all of you back there. There's so much work that was done to get us to where we're at today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's not every day that we can talk about adding approximately 30 officers to our police department. And for all of you who are sitting back there, you know how impactful it's been over the years in reducing our police department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we're turning it around between Measure three and this blue line contract, if you guys approve it tonight, what an excellent opportunity for the city. And the city has been asking for this. There's many places I've gone our constituents, our community, our stakeholders, our business community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everybody wanted the Long Beach Police Department to acquire this contract. And that's exactly what we did. So what I wanted to do is give credit where credit is due. And over my right shoulder is more of a law school.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She is our financial our chief financial officer. And standing next to her is Brandon Walker. And both of them started this venture back in December. It was a very lengthy process going back and forth. There were a couple of times where, frankly, we were told the sheriff's department would retain this contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you're aware, that did not happen. So a lot of paperwork, a lot of planning, a lot of research. And throughout this process, I was contacted by several people who worked at Metro who continuously stated that the the request from the city of Long Beach was so much better than the one received from the city of Los'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Angeles and the sheriff's department. So I'm very proud of the paperwork that was done, the contract requests from Mara and Brandon. And then now we start transitioning into actually working if you guys approve this tonight. Now the operational part of this starts and standing over my left shoulder is Deputy Chief Mike Beckman, who runs our support bureau'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and Commander Joe Cook. And they'll be in charge of the daily operation of what I think is going to be one of the best well policed transit systems anywhere in the country. And they're responsible for it now. They've been working their tails off, putting plans together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the team standing before me is what did it. Mara and Brandon will continue to work on it for the next five years and the 34 years that we have. Please remember that a couple of weeks ago, all of you voted on another measure re staffing proposal to upgrade our Academy staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What you and in essence did is you assisted us in recharging our recruiting and hiring and training efforts. And that's how we're going to get there, where we hire the additional staff not only for the thefts we're talking about, but the other 17 for measure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, yeah, good times. I think congratulations is in order for all of us. It was a excellent team effort and I'm really looking forward to this opportunity. Thank you very much for recognizing the people behind me. They truly worked their tails off and they will continue to do so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Chief. And congratulations again to to the team. You guys did a fantastic job. I know that our our management team also were very active in this whole process. I wanted to also just think I wanted to thank I asked Sharon Weisman, who's behind me to come down.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sharon is my new transportation deputy metro, and she spent a lot of time working with all the other board members and staffs of all the other board members just to ensure that they have the information and to me, to ensure that we would end up with a unanimous vote, which is which is what we did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it wasn't going to be, I will tell you that for sure. But I think once the writing was on the wall of where it was going, everyone else came on board. And so Sharon behind me. Sharon, I wanted to thank you, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your work on this. Give a round of applause.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, Mayor, if I may, you're right. The city manager's office was instrumental in this. And financial management working from a city perspective, just working out the numbers so that everything would go our way, was very instrumental in getting this done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I didn't want to forget about them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. And let me go to let me go to the Long Beach City Council, Councilmember Pearce. Oh, I'm sorry. Count's embarrassing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, it's okay. I could have gone after Councilmember Pearce, but I wanted to just take this opportunity, Chief, to congratulate you and your department on this new responsibility. I think it's great for the city of Long Beach. I think it's more of a congratulations to the residents in the riders of the Blue Line.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Because this this this agreement will make our blue line, I believe, much safer. I think one one key point that was raised that was pretty compelling is that how response times will be improved from having local police department patrolling and assigned to the blue line.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Response times will be cut from 15 minutes to 5 to 6 minutes, and I think that is a a number that is very, very compelling and and one that we should all look forward to to see it. It will speak to a real change and a much safer experience on the blue line.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also want to remark on just our mayor and Mayor Garcia and his his work. Early work on the on the MTA board on this this agreement came about I think he was he had been on the board for maybe a month, a little over that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These conversations obviously were being had prior to his joining the board. But I think it speaks to having a seat at the table and the importance of having a seat at the table. And for those of you who know me, for a long time, I've been a strong advocate for a Long Beach, having a seat at the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'MTA board. And so I'm glad that we finally have a strong leader there to speak for Long Beach. And obviously he's yielding great results immediately. And I honestly think that there are still great announcements ahead of us and the best is still yet to come.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, congratulations to everybody involved here. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Thank you, chief, and to all of you for being here and for your hard work. I know the next five years is going to be we're going to have a great start. It will be a lot of work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I really do believe that having our own Long Beach Police Department, enforcing on the blue line and hopefully just being there, of course, as a positive element to the riders along the blue line, especially when they come into the Grand Prix and they're coming here for amazing events that they'll be able to see.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our own police department there is going to be fantastic and thanks for Mayor and Supervisor Horn as well. I know that they were integral in that this whole situation happening and this is a huge, huge win for downtown, a huge win for the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thanks again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, now I'll start everything that I needed to say. And I'm kidding. I do want to just congratulate you guys and congratulate the mayor and everybody that worked really hard on this. I know seeing something turn from a maybe to a big victory with a unanimous vote is really important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I was honored to speak at Metro that day, and it was only a minute which maybe we need. No kidding. It was really hard to speak for only a minute, but the one thing that I think was really enlightening is that our response times are going to change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As Councilmember Austin mentioned, I think it's, what, 7 to 10 minutes difference, which can be really important for people riding the metro, riding our blue line. And as someone who's written that for many years, I know how important that is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I listened to the comments that were made at Metro that day, and I just want to say that I'm really proud to have our PD on our metro line. I think that the training that we're doing, the equity lens that we're talking about, the investment that you guys are making in the community to be able to have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that throughout our entire city on our metro is really exciting. So I just wanted to make sure that I mentioned how proud I am of all the work that you guys are doing. I did have one question that I probably could've asked offline, but when tickets are given on the Metro, where where do those dollars go?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They do go to the county. We in the past, when we've given very Bayesian tickets, it now is change where it's a civil action and it's all done within the county. But there is going to be a process that we're following where Metro wants to do a different job, or they want to approach fare evasion in a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'very different way. But I think one of the things that we're very attractive to them is we have an outstanding juvenile diversion program. So it does involve juveniles. We can enter them in a diversion program that we have here in the city with our private partners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, maybe we should look at free rides for youth. I don't know, Justin, but just thank you for the information, guys, and congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. And a big congratulations and appreciation to our mayor. Like everyone has said for leading the effort on this, I think this is fantastic. And Chief, there is a few questions that we are getting from the community as we're out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I thought this probably would be a good time to ask you about it right now. One of the things that we've been telling the community is this is this is a great development for the blue line in our ability to enforce in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But in addition to that, it's going to relieve pressure citywide for the police department. And that's something that we've heard. Can you speak to that a little bit?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. When we have more uniformed presence along our corridors, which would be primarily Long Beach Boulevard in Pacific, if you can picture at least a half a dozen more officers per shift in those areas. That improves the visibility, which in turn will have a positive impact, we believe, on crime and the quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to have to work up to those numbers, of course. But when we get there, when you're adding 30 new officers to our department, how can you go wrong? And that's what we're really looking forward to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, will these officers also be available to respond to citywide emergencies or things that may be called upon for their services and their assistance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely, yes. On both ways, when we need help anywhere in the city, they can respond. And when Metro needs help, we respond just like we currently do with any contract that our police department serves now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, that's fantastic. I think it's a win win for the whole city. So thank you. Congratulations to your department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. I want to add my voice to the kudos that are being distributed here today, especially through the great staff work that was done today by not only your command staff, but also by your civilian staff as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that the AKUTAGAWA in this whole thing was getting the mayor on the MTA board. And I will congratulate you, Mayor, on your efforts on making sure that this happened. Good job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. Also, I want to congratulate everyone you know who has been able to make this contract happen. But most of all, I want to thank the mayor for you and your hard work and efforts on the board, you know, being a board member.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you, too, for the Long Beach Police Department, you know, able to embark on this process. You know, public safety, the metro line is important, I think, to all of us and the residents who rely on public transportation, and they deserve to feel very safe and free.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know you individual will be the one that makes that possible. So I'm glad that the city is able to provide this type of service to our residents and everyone is playing on right on, you know, our metro.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you guys again and keep up the good work. You haven't started yet, but I'd tell you to keep up the good work because you have to start somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Orson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I did have a quick question for the chief, more of an operational type of question. I rode the blue line just the day before yesterday, a couple of days ago downtown, and there were several announcements being made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was reading some of the signage in the blue line. Some of the signage said, it's okay if there's a problem, contact the sheriff's department at this number. Will there be a pass through for those that information for for Long Beach PD on the metro train?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Will people have to contact the sheriff's department to get to Long Beach PD or will there be something specific for for us, for for our city? Or have we worked those details out yet?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. We're still in the process of working all that out. That's part of the next several months where the L.A. County Sheriff's Department is demobilizing what they're doing. Then figure out exactly how our system's going to integrate with them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I anticipate that whatever model we come up with is going to be a whole lot better than what they had.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, it's important to note that that currently to boot that line runs through several jurisdictions. And so. Correct. That's one of those issues that need to be worked out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice Mayor Richardson.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'We had also talked about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Smart meter money that was to be used for improvements. And then I know measure a money will also be used for improvements at City Place. So I guess my question is why we would need an extension of the 400 or an additional $450,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think those are two different items. This is the operating side of the garage. So ESP plus again not only operates city place garage but our beach lots in any location where we collect fees for for parking and where we have attendants that are working in those lots.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is, again, primarily needed to cover increased security cost for the garage. If you recall, at some time ago, the city extended an opportunity for Molina Medical to park in the garage. And with those additional parkers, there was a requirement to increase the level of security within those garages that that at the time, we did not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'come to council and ask for a contract increase. So this increases essentially to cover those increased costs. So the operational portion of the parking lots and garages is going to go out in a new RFP. The physical improvements to the garages are being accommodated under a different contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would be a construction contract and a design contract, not necessarily under ESP. Plus they do do small maintenance issues. So if we needed to add a security camera, for example, in a garage, we would usually rely on our parking operator to do that for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if we are talking about some of the things that you and I reviewed in City Place Garage, those are going to be handled under a different contract.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So then, just so I am clear, and when is this contract is this contract up with the current with ESP plus? Is it up any time soon or. I know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So we're currently on an extension that I believe takes us through I want to say February, but we don't believe that we'll need that entire term of the current operation timeframe because we think we'll have a new vendor in front of council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or it could be SB plus, but that will have a new contract in place ready to go for council approval by June.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, great. And so with all that, I would like to ask if we could if I'd like to just make a substitute motion, if I could, to be able to get an itemized list of these improvements first prior to approving this tonight, because I think I need to get a little bit more clear on what we're doing'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and also to provide that to our public, because I don't think I've been verbalizing that to a lot of our downtown residents and business owners, but I just don't think that they realize what is actually happening at the city place garages.'",

The space is available because I know there has been some confusion as to the private spaces available and the public spaces available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think we need to clear that up first before making a decision on this contract or extending. This. So that is my motion.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'At one point I've seen a woman who was lying on the median. I caught her in my rearview mirror and thought, Oh my gosh, do I need to call 911? What's going on? And she rolled over and moved.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I understand that some cities do require that, and perhaps that is another avenue that we could pursue. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. Somebody left a pen up here. I commend the makers of this motion. It's obviously a very serious issue. One of the things that I like to hear. The individual that said that it's a violation of civil rights and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That people should be allowed to do that, if they will, that that individual will put his money where his mouth is and agree to pay any liability that flows from any accidents that would come flow from the type of activity we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think an easy way to address that are one of the inexpensive way is to put rubber stanchions like we already have on highways that funnel traffic off like on the Davis Bridge. Are there places inundate that median with those stanchions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're relatively inexpensive to put in there all around the city, and that would reduce. Bottom line is they wouldn't have it. Nobody would be able to stand there and look for it. One final thing reference to just permit me for 10 seconds and representative councilman, your anger's a good idea relative to sending out the library notice on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the water bill. Make sure that people understand it's not a threat to shut down your work. Cut off your water. Some people make that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So we'll take you back behind the rail. Councilmember Suber now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm fine. Thank you to all the members of the public who came down here tonight. This is an issue in multiple districts, as some of the speakers indicated, and primarily on public safety issues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor. And I also want to thank Councilwoman Price for bringing this item forward. And I think it's very important for all of us to take a look at the change that medians can bring about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I have quite a few in my area also. But I think the saddest part, a lot of the individuals who decide not to go down to the crosswalk or to the light, they would rather go out from the medians.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's where we are going to have some problems. So, you know, I think traffic and pedestrian safety is one of, you know, my number one priorities. And I would want to want to avoid any tragedy possible in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is why I'm truly in favor of this item. Thank you very much. God surprise, for bringing this item forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Thank you for everybody who has spoken on this item. And so I after reading this item, I was a little bit confused because I see one thing, but I so I just want to get some clarity around this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I understand the goal and the mission of the community members. But this item says with with safety as.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A specific focus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. Says safety is a specific focus. And so with that, is there data that backs up the car accidents, the collisions that we're talking about here? Because I know for in my district from experience, when we've had some of the largest and most dangerous intersections, we've had data to back that up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To be able to say this is why it's such a problem in the in the area gun Byner Park was one of those areas. We collected the data, we had community meetings and then finally we got a park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I don't see that here. So do we have. Any information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, if I could answer that, actually, you're correct. So we worked with the city attorney's office to draft this item. In fact, Jack Cunningham from my staff has been working with the city attorney's office for a few months now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And yes, we do have data. As I mentioned in my initial comments, we have data for highest traffic volumes and highest traffic incidents for the last ten years. The last five years. In the last year. But what I was hoping for is that tonight would be allowing the city attorney to go back and look at the different'",
        "'speaker_8': 'options that are available to us. Because if public safety is truly the concern, then the goal wouldn't be to ban people from all medians. It would be to ban people from medians where there is high traffic volumes or collision related data that would support it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So yes, we have that that data available. We can make it available to anyone's officers that they would like. We have the top 25 busiest intersections where there is a high incidence of traffic collisions. Okay. So then my next question would be, thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It would be good to see that information first. But why? So instead of having the city attorney look at this information, why don't we do a traffic study and have our public works traffic division? Look at this information that would seem to me a little bit more within their purview and realm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, the data we have is from our traffic engineers. They've already done the data analysis. And then which intersections? I mean, it's because I think we're just giving the information to our city attorney. But there's I don't have any we don't have any data to go off of based on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On this item. So I guess what I'm suggesting is that perhaps going to our traffic engineers, getting some information and data on that. First, I believe we also have master plans that are in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Information related to lessening traffic collisions, lessening pedestrian collisions, lessening bike collisions. And so I think gathering all that data first would be, I don't know, the most feasible in my opinion, but. That's the information on I'll share. And then which I mean if you have that data, it'd be nice to see it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But if you have that information, which of the I don't know, are there top three medians that have the most what are the top three medians? I don't even know what those locations would be. Sure. And again, just to clarify, we're not directing the city manager to prohibit people standing on specific medians.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're asking him within the legal parameters that he has. There has to be a neutral reason to limit people's access to medians. So whether that's high traffic volumes or high collision data, those would be recommendations that they would come back to us on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're not saying that we would like you to draft an ordinance that would prohibit median access for the highest volume intersections. We're not saying that at this point, but in the past ten years, the top three intersections where there were most collisions were Long Beach Boulevard and Ward Low Redondo and Seventh PCH.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And second, that was in the last ten years. In the last five years, the three top intersections in our medians were Pacific Coast Highway in Second Street, Redondo Avenue and Seventh Street, Long Beach Boulevard and Wardlow. In the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Year, the top.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Collisions were Redondo and Seventh. Pacific Coast Highway, Outer Traffic Circle and Anaheim Street at Long Beach Boulevard. Okay. And I again, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Focusing on the safety aspect. So I think I don't know in terms of process, I guess in my mind works is that we ask for information back from our traffic engineers, we get the data and then we're able to make a determination as to which what to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then I don't know why we would just jump to the city attorney's office to find out feasibility opportunities and constraints both legal and practical. So limiting media access. And so I think it's just a little off. So I don't know that I'll be supporting it as is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like us to consider possibly going back to our traffic engineer and bringing that information back to the council so we can have a little bit more informed information prior to just sending it to the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So after hearing my colleagues, that might be the direction I may propose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. I want to thank the cosigners of this for the intent around public safety, but I definitely am going to talk through one as I think process, I think. Councilmember Price. Councilwoman Price, you have a lot of information in front of you that if we all had that same information, it might have made tonight a little easier'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to kind of go forward and say, okay, now we really understand the intent. And so thank you for working with the staff and having your staff do all that work. It would be great to have that information upfront on future items.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have a couple of things. One is it's my understanding that we already have a law on the muni code that prohibits people from soliciting in medians. No persons shall so offer, give, distribute any merchandise or manner or manner and description whatsoever, including newspapers, printed material.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No person shall solicit contribute donations for my position or place upon any public street in the city. Public street using means highway roadways, streets, medians, divider islands. So we already have some policies in place. Number one, that's in our muni code that already says that it's illegal to do a lot of that activity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would want us to be really careful. I do think that, you know, I have gotten some concerns from my constituents around who would be most impacted by a policy like this. And my response is that it's already on the books.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Number two, if we if the concern of this item, which I, as someone who's had three fatalities in my districts from pedestrian and car collisions, definitely care about public safety in this, we already have adopted a Vision Zero strategy last year and staff, I believe we received a $250,000 grant to bring a consultant on to talk about'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vision Zero. Can you guys give us a little bit of background on Vision Zero and if it would include what the council members are looking for today? Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our public works director, Craig Beck will respond to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Mayor, members of the city council, I believe recently a staff report was sent to all of you to talk about Vision Zero. And essentially the goal with Vision Zero is to get to a point where we don't see vehicular and pedestrian incidents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We want to create safe corridors, safe passages for our pedestrians within the city. We are bringing on a consultant with the grant funds that we just recently received. We will be looking at a number of call them hotspots or dangerous intersections within the city and elements that we can do to improve pedestrian safety within those intersections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that will include kind of a Vision Zero task force, if you will, that will be able to come forward and make a number of additional recommendations to council as we move our Vision zero plan to implementation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. And so these medians obviously would be areas as we've listed that we already have a priority list would be included as a top priority for the Vision Zero work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, certainly we don't encourage pedestrians to be in medians. That's not a safe area to be. We want to try to keep people to not only cross at signalized intersections when at all possible, but if not make sure that they are in a crosswalk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that rarely includes crossing and being in a median area which isn't typically safe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, and I thank you for your comments on the Vision Zero. What's our timeline on the Vision zero?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I hope to have a consultant on board within the next 60 days. And then I imagine we're looking with community input and in finalizing an implementation plan somewhere in the 4 to 6 month time frame to get that ready for council adoption for implementation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you for that. I think there's. Let me see if I have one more question. Um, I think that's it. I think that, that the intent of this item is already carried through with the Vision Zero work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I would not want to ask our staff to double the work or to look at prohibiting people where we already are, prohibiting them in our muni code. And so I will not be supporting this item, but I definitely support the intent and want to continue to make sure that working together with the Vision Zero team'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and with our staff directors on making sure we can create a safe community for everybody. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I got to tell you, when I saw this item, I didn't think this would. Bring on so much debate that this would be a pretty quick item. And in my opinion, it's a it's a pretty common sense, no brainer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will be supporting it. I want to thank Councilmember Price and Supernormal and Urunga for bringing it forward. Obviously, these are concerns that these council members have in their district. I'm as well I'm very concerned about pedestrian safety, period.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do understand and think some really good points have been raised about there already being an ordinance on the books and us engaging the need to engage our traffic engineers for solutions. I think this this the recommendation in asking this item actually looks for a legal opinion on what best practices are and what what options are available'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on the legal front and in the end, as well as what can be engineered. So what type of solutions can be engineered through. And I think that is the task of the city manager's office and that's why I read this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so, you know, I hope we can we can get through this. This is, like I said, a pretty, pretty common sense item. And I look forward to getting the report back. And again, I will be supportive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to go to Councilman Mungo. I just want to add just one thing also real quick here and correct if I'm wrong, Councilman Price, but it's my understanding that the reason this is being directed to the city manager and the city attorney's office is also to get, like Councilmember Orson said, just the legal clarity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, the truth is, is that there is actual case law. There is a lot of court conversations that have happened around this issue. And so I think Councilman Price is looking to get some legal framework of what actually is or isn't possible in this area, that she's able to take that information and can give it to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'her constituents and ensure that the people that are making these requests and asking of the information have the information and that we and that the city is able to know what we can and cannot do. So I, I have viewed this item as an opportunity to request to get to gain information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is no there is no asking it to create an ordinance in this item. It's asking to get some legal clarity and some information from staff to bring it back so that the council has the full information of what is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Allowed both legally and not allowed. And I think that's really, I think, important. And and I also think that there is enough folks in the community that have asked about this issue. And I think it would be it would be wise to get the community that have asked for the information, the information from the attorneys office.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to throw that out there. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. I'm going to talk to the the broader point on this. First, I'm going to start with stating that I'm going to support the item tonight. And then specifically on the information that has been provided to many of us, has been very decentralized in specific to our districts and we go out into the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was at a community meeting, I think it was last week where we had 70 neighbors who had similar types of concerns, and we have a similar discussion with each different group of neighbors related to the traffic issues and instances in their district, in their area where they live.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Within the district, there are several intersections and neighborhoods that have impact. And when one neighborhood's impact is fixed, we have to work really hard not to just be moving that impact to another district. And so I'd like to add even just to put it out there, it's not completely in alignment with going to the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just going to state a few things that I think we need to be talking about and considering. One, all of the data that is provided to each of our offices related to these medians needs to be put on the Internet immediately.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have open data. Data LBE should have the number of accidents per intersection. It should have all the information that each of us know about our own council districts. And so while it's easy for us to say, Well, Councilmember Price, I don't have your data because I also don't have that data, that that really is the responsibility'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of data lab. And so we need to be open and transparent about this because what ends up happening is we end up getting the data, then going to our community meetings and then the community has to both digest the data we're giving them and talk through the risks and potential solutions and and potential best practices and some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the case law and issues with some of the things they're asking for. I'd like to take it a step further and say that once we get to this point, the traffic engineer that came and spoke at our community meeting last week, hands down, A-plus, a professional who knows and understands this stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need just to have a mini video that each of us as council members can direct people to, because we want the community to be able to come up with solutions. But sometimes the solutions they come up with aren't legally allowable by the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or there's past issues with a solution, for instance, a boulder being cemented into a median. There are other issues that have come up with that and other legal challenges, and that's not a possibility at large at certain intersections of certain sizes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So all of that needs to be outlined and available so that community has the access to that information without giving up 2 hours of their night on a weeknight when they would rather be at yoga or watching their favorite TV program or having dinner with their children or helping with their homework.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I hope that this is a bit of either if the staff are understanding where I think we as a council think we need to go, that's great. If not, I'm happy to work with two other council members to put an item on the agenda in the next several weeks that this is an important thing for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'us as a city. And I think that public works has been such a help. But to continue to draw on our city engineers, to come to community meeting after community meeting after community meeting, in my neighborhoods, we have almost 15 community groups.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's just a lot of resources of a highly paid staff member who already has a backlog of traffic studies that we need to get done. So just a thought. Let's use that technology available to us and I will be supporting the item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Counsel for Supernanny.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I signed on to this item and I seconded the motion tonight, so I will be in support. I'd just like to speak to the concept of narrowing the focus at this point, or as a suggestion. Let's come up with a finite number of intersections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not the time to narrow the focus. This is when we need to expand the focus. An example, Councilman Price red off. One of the intersections was PCH, an outer circle. That's in the fourth district that the traffic circle in general has issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other thing we have to understand is PCH is under the jurisdiction of Caltrans, as is the traffic circle. You go north on PCH and the well north, by the way, is described, but the northern side of PCH is Signal Hill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So where it's multi-jurisdictional, we need as much input here as possible. The other thing we have in our district speaking with Caltrans are our freeway on ramps, which we get calls on weekly on those. So I would just like to suggest we keep this open at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We move to exactly what the proposal is and be all inclusive in the information gathering mode. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you. And I would like to say that I will first like to add a friendly amendment, if I could, and I'd like to add a few things that after hearing my colleagues, I want to make sure that we are and I didn't expect this to go on and be this big deal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I really feel that in terms of process, we need to add additional information. So there's just a few things that I'm going to ask when we're looking to send this to a city attorney. So a friendly amendment will include the information to Councilmember Janine Pierce's point that will include Vision Zero information, meeting information.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So all the data that a council woman price has related to medians and traffic and collisions that should be provided in a two from four as soon as possible. Again, I think this information is pertinent to not only the community but to the council members to look at, you know, issues all over the city and then the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'attorney language. You know, again, just want to clarify that this is a feasibility to focus on safety first, not any other issues, that it should be separate. So safety first is as noted here in the agenda. So if those are accepted, I would hope so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then I would be. Gladly to support. I'm happy to accept. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Pick Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I agree with the the amendment as provided. Truthfully, I was somewhat hesitant to sign in on this on this item, but I want to thank him to do so. And the reason I was hesitant, because in the past years, 18 Lions Club members, I have seen firefighters donate to the boot, also on medians, asking for donations for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the foundation. And so, I mean, I was like, okay, well, we need a better clarification as to what can we legally or legal or illegal or illegally or not accept in terms of what's a medians. There's also people who are making statements or just just using their First Amendment rights on medians.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, I mean, there's there's a lot of other things taking place other than panhandling or people just illegally crossing in the middle of the street to go to the other side. So a totally in agreement with the need to study this further.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's why I signed on to this, because I think that it's important that we get complete information and clarification as to what's taking place here in the use of medians for public information or for other types of purposes, such as panhandling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I will I will be supporting the title.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. I want to thank my colleague for bringing up your your friendly. I did have a question around. The task force is still here. Yes. Sorry. Can you let me know if we have community organizations as a part of that Vision Zero Task Force?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce we can certainly expand to community members. I think initially we were looking at representation from both the traffic engineering group, our health department, our police department to focus on some of the more enforcement and safety issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then once we came up with a number of recommendations that we would go out to the community and share with different community groups and gain input from that perspective.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'd like for us to just have a conversation about it, and it doesn't need to be part of this item, but how we include organizations that might come in contact with people that panhandle or in those medians so that we can talk about an education program for them or what legal things, besides giving them a citation'",
        "'speaker_6': ', might we be able to do to be in alignment with the rest of the vision that the city has laid out around trying to do wraparound services and everything like that? So I'll say that. And then, you know, I think being really clear on the item that it is around public safety, that we're including the vision zero'",
        "'speaker_6': 'part, the red flag for me, just as always, any time that we can get in a situation where we're criminalizing one group, but like my colleague said, not criminalizing another, whether it's people at the boots, I just have to be really careful and cautious.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'll support this item with the friendly amendments made and I look forward to report coming back where we're being really clear about this being specifically for public safety and how we can ensure that we're not isolating one or one type of of people to be targeted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I just want to chime in. You know, we like the here Long Beach is a collection of neighborhoods and there's clearly neighborhood support for this recommendation. So I you know, I have no problems with what was brought forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I do want to acknowledge the sensitivity that was brought up about, you know, making sure we're clear about what the intent is. And but I think that this is just being a responsive councilperson. So congrats on that. I would also say, you know, I don't want to get a ticket for going and pick up any couches or'",
        "'speaker_9': 'mattresses up the median. So so if you see me in the median picking something up, you know, is that okay? Do I get a pass? All right. I think we're fine. But, you know, I also would say, you know, there's these flags that keep popping up, you know, these big flags.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's not you know, I don't I don't know who's putting them up. These flags keep coming up and our business district keeps take them down. It is a you know, maybe a safety issue will say. You know, this this blight gets there somehow.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I want to thank my colleagues. So just for clarifying, so actually a few things. First, I want to thank Councilman Turanga for signing on to this item. I think the beauty of this body is, for the most part, we have a group of people who are willing to work with one another, even when we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'have differences in our particular neighborhoods that may not bleed into other neighborhoods. And I appreciate that. So and I've sat in his office before and he's enlightened me on things that are important to him that I may not see in my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I appreciate that collaboration. So I want to thank you for that and for signing on and for giving it an opportunity. And I agree with you. I think the filling the boot, the you know, we have an issue in the third district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think some of my neighborhood association presidents who are here will understand where we have people in the medians. We call them guerilla gardeners. They go out there and they garden in the medians. That is dangerous. We we don't want that either.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't want Girl Scout cookies being sold on the medians. It's just I don't want car washes being solicited from the medians. It's just a dangerous traffic hazard. And people get confused, especially. I mean, it just you have to be on your game when you're driving.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if there's a distraction or someone, you know, a foot or two away from your car, it can be really distracting. Regardless of what they're doing or what uniform they might be wearing. It doesn't matter. And in fact, if there were car washes on the corner, every time I went to the iron triangle, we would be bringing'",
        "'speaker_8': 'an item. But those are so few and far between that they don't necessitate the issue that we have here today because it's something we're seeing. This is my community, the people that came out here tonight, I represent I proudly represent them.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think a lot of. Mr. Mayor, your attention on the commissions has opened up some opportunities for us to update and modernize. So the Commission on Youth and Children was established in 2003 and is currently overseen by the Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At that time, the purpose was to advise and make policy recommendations to the City Council of the Needs, Concerns and Problems of Children and Youth promote coordination with Long Beach Unified School District and other youth based organizations, and to review various city plans that are now outdated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Commission is a youth adult board consisting of ten adults and nine youth. You know, we've we have very highly, highly qualified and capable committee members, but according to staff, has been challenging to fill all the positions, particularly youth seats.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's been increasingly difficult to reach a quorum because of that. Currently, 13 of the 19 maximum positions are filled. Additionally, I've spoken with a number of the adult commissioners who feel there's a lack of clarity from the Commission's point of view on the purpose and scope of work as it relates to current city priority priorities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So in working with the mayor's office and working with staff and commissioners, it seems like a good point in time now to pause, assess the current status of the Commission and evaluate how how to ensure that the Commission has an updated purpose, a more defined scope, a scope of work based on the city's current programs, our current'",
        "'speaker_9': 'initiatives. And so while I know that many of our separate Council districts have youth commit youth advisory boards or youth committees, we're also exploring, you know, what might look like if we were to explore the feasibility and advantages of of a separate citywide youth youth led commission and an adult commission.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'It's not a criticism. It's more of a maybe just some assistance is needed because that's an area where I think as a vice mayor, Richardson has pointed out to me on several occasions, we all have a common bond, so I want to thank him for bringing this forward.'",

I know through my years of work in organizing that often spaces where we have youth and adults, sometimes our visions are different. Sometimes the way we work is a little bit different, the way that we learn is a little different.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so if we are going to prioritize this commission, which I think we should, I think we also have to challenge ourselves and start to think about how do we engage with the youth if we are looking at two separate commissions or we're looking at having two separate that they then come together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If there's some support for some of that staffing, this commission on facilitation and creative ways to engage with them. And I also know that it's a challenge on us as council members to think about what are we giving this commission to work on so that they have meaningful engagement?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so with that, I just want to say thank you for this. I hope we continue to do great work. And I also would like us to explore is there any connection here with Elba USD? Are we collaborating at all with them?'",

I know that we have a partnership item coming before council as well, and I think that there are a lot of opportunities both after school and with our commissioners and to get a group of students involved'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We've actually been discussing in our district what we need to do to recruit younger commissioners that can serve a full term versus seniors in high school for our youth commission. And so we're really excited about this upcoming process we're launching.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank some of the members of the commission that are actually here. Particularly want to thank two members of the commission that both wear double hats. And that is Vivienne, who we know also serves on our community college board, my Lulu over here, and as well as Megan Kerr, who also serves on the Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unified School Board. And the fact that we have these two women who also serve our community and our youth on this board, as well as a variety of other youth and community members, bless you with expertize is a really great resource for us at the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think that and I think it's important to note that this item is not a reflection of what we want is to empower this commission and we want the commission to work with staff to inform us what is it that we need to do to support the Commission more?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is how can we restructure the commission in a way? Do we ensure that you both and and everyone else that's involved are successful as commissioners on the Commission on Youth and Children? And so maybe the scope needs to be enlarged, maybe it needs to be smaller, maybe there needs to be other, maybe the membership could'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be different. I don't think we know the answer to those questions. I do know and I want to note the commission has already started some of this work. And so the commission internally has already been discussing how they can improve their their mission or expand their mission and change it to serve the needs of the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I just want to also recognize staff who's been working with the commission. The commission has been taking the initiative on this issue. And I think this kind of solidifies the Council's support in supporting the work that's happening and beyond as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to thank and all the members of the commission that are here and that are, I know, watching as well. So let's give them a round of applause and thank them for their service. And with that, let me open it up to public comment.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And the problems that we've run into really are in the very narrowly defined scope of why the commission was created in the first place. It was actually created in conjunction with a city program that no longer exists. So this commission was actually supposed to advise that particular program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So once that program went away, the commission remained. Yet the very narrow scope of our work has to do with a non-existent program. So when we would do our work and have conversations, we really realized that we didn't have any kind of authority or purview to talk about the activities that were really pertinent to the youth who'",
        "'speaker_8': 'are currently serving on the committee. So I think this is a great opportunity to refocus, look at the priorities of the city, the priorities of this council around the issues of youth and children, and really create a collaborative board that and commission that can work with you could answer your questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do apologize. We we met several times to talk about that data. But the reality is the members of this commission do not have the availability to data to create any kind of report and analysis that really is a staff job.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we kept running into was that that wasn't something that we could even actually accomplish. It wasn't for lack of wanting to. I think we had five subcommittee meetings to try and make it happen. So it really is around the technical description of this commission, and I welcome being part of the conversation to restructure it to better'",

And a lot of the frustration has to do with the fact that we've got so many awesome people on the commission who are doers and we have so many ideas.'",

Like my colleague Megan Kerr stated, this commission was actually established to support the Long Beach Youth Network, which is has been defunct for several years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is no longer a Long Beach youth network, so our commission has sort of been in limbo. Now I'm very grateful for the opportunity. We have had lots of meetings to try to evaluate our use. We do have ideas and I would just like to urge the Council to please vote yes to move forward on this action'",

And because if left unregulated, these boxes become a blight and nuisance in the community because of the tendency of people to dump all manner of junk and other material in and around the boxes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And finally, adopting a moratorium will maintain the status quo until the city can fashion appropriate zoning regulations that will address nuisance concerns, comply with new federal case law, and will resolve current inconsistencies between the city's business license regulations and the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we could, I would like to go to public comment right away. We're honored to have Janet McCarthy, the president and CEO of Goodwill, in the audience. And thank you for your patience.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, everyone. Thank you for your service. Truly, I am Janet McCarthy. I'm the president, CEO of Goodwill, serving the people of seven Los Angeles County. And I do appreciate the fact that you've placed this recommendation to adopt a minute order declaring a moratorium against the establishment placement, construction expansion or issuance of any permits for the placement'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of unattended donation recycling collection boxes or bins on any public or private lot in the city on your agenda. I personally and my board at Goodwill and all those that we serve wholeheartedly support the Council's adoption of a moratorium for the following reasons Goodwill SOLAK.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's our acronym for the long serving the people of some Los Angeles County. So that, you know, I will repeat that our mission is to help individuals in our community with barriers to employment, either get to work or get back to work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Our mission is funded by the sale of donations received by residents of the 24 cities and southern Los Angeles County of which we serve. And Long Beach happens to be one of those 24 cities. Given our ability to accomplish, our mission is dependent upon the revenue we generate through the donated goods and retail operations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a business model that requires professionals in operations, logistics, transportation, retail and recycling. It's also one that requires knowledge of and compliance with a host of city, county, state and national and environmental regulations. The proliferation of middle of the night unattended donation bins being dropped is a concern so great that it has rose to the attention of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the state capital and took shape in legislation AB 918 and SB 450 also designed to combat the problem. Unattended donation bins pose several problems for our community. They are run for by for profit companies in nonprofit clothing. They often attempt to buy communities off by minor contributions that are very small fraction of the profits that they realize'",
        "'speaker_10': 'as corporations. The salvage business is a multibillion dollar industry that is publicly traded. Like any other commodity, these dollars permanently leave the community without sustaining it in any way in which goodwill has for over 100 years. Unattended bins are blight magnets, routinely riddled with graffiti and surrounded by refuge, refuse that is unusable and simply dumped there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In essence, they are mobile alleys. Personally, I am, uh, called upon often by our community because they think it's Goodwill's problem. They think that we're the ones that caused that. And quite honestly, I think we're quite great neighbors in the community of Long Beach and we do everything we do and can to keep all of our community'",
        "'speaker_10': 'clean. Many of these unattended bins are run by companies and or individuals that are excuse me, impossible to contact and are therefore unconcerned and unaccountable for the problems that they create for the communities they exist within. With limited contact and accountability.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The problems unattended bins create leave residents with one destination for their concerns. And that is all of you and all of your staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I got to the time here in Boise.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, it's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I but by the way, I recommend that you hope have a moratorium on this thing. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for listening. Thank you so much for everything Goodwill does. Amazing organization. And we know Long Beach is a partner, obviously, and we are so thankful for the workforce development that happens on site and for the partnerships and just you're such a good partner in building this community, so just thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I really appreciate you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Austin, actually, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I support this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I certainly would support this item. I think I brought something an ordinance about three years ago to ban these these. And unmanned you beds in the city. I'd like to get some some clarification from the city attorney as to what has changed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Held seven Austin members of the city council. It's a little bit complicated, but I did not realize you brought an item a few years ago. But what's happened is in the last two years across the country, these companies that want to put these boxes in communities have sued in federal court on a theory that these donation boxes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are no different than a panhandler in the street, and they have an absolute constitutional right to locate pretty much wherever they want in a city. So there's a trend in those federal cases that did not exist two years ago that is currently there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in addition, within the last year, the City Department of Planning and Department of Development Services and the city attorney's office has been contacted by individual companies that desire to put these and are asserting that they have a constitutional right to do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've also been contacted by different lobbying companies that exist outside of Long Beach, actually in different states, making the same argument. So we started looking into the matter and saw that cities locally, some locally, like Torrance, for instance, which were threatened with litigation City of Oakland, which was actually sued in 2015 over these unattended donation boxes'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Litigation was popping up. So in order to get ahead of the game, so to speak, we thought it was appropriate to suggest that a moratorium be put in place because our current zoning ordinance doesn't. We have what's called a specific a permissive zoning ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So unless you are specifically allowed to do something, you're denied. So if you brought this matter forth three years ago, that would have been the case. It wasn't a use that was regulated. And in doing the research, we determined that there is currently an inconsistency between what is in Title five about and manned donation boxes and what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is currently in Title 21. So that's the difference between then and now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So from what I can glean from that, it would be totally impermissible and unacceptable to put you in a median.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it depends. Research it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The median advocates will be here next week. Thanks a lot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. You learn something new every day. I had no idea that there are for profit companies that were using this. So thank you guys for bringing this item up. I did have a question. Are there Long Beach nonprofits that that use these youth bodies?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we know? Anybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know the answer to that, but I do know that this will not result in a total ban on you. The goal will be to put in place regulations that will meet constitutional requirements and will still allow them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But you will probably see such things. What other cities have done. They have spacing requirements. They can't be, you know, within 1000 feet of each other, for instance, specific requirements for how they look, how they're maintained, lighting things so that people can't drop articles at night after dark, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's just junk around the boxes. So that's what we're looking to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And requirements also around how often they pick them up and everything. Correct. Okay. Um, well, when I first took a look at this and the other item that kind of made my hair stand on ends, but I definitely support this and thank you guys for doing the legal work on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you, Councilmember. Super not for bringing this forward. I, too, was a little unclear on this to begin with, but now it makes total sense. And just have a couple of quick questions. How many do we know off the top of our head?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How many bins we have citywide? How many of these you. You would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Councilmember, we do have some of these citywide, but they're related to existing businesses. So, for example, if there is a drop off location that's related to goodwill or Salvation Army or someone like that, they're considered accessory to the main use and we can permit them in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The unattended donation bins, we have been very clear that we do not have a permitting process for that. And so when we do come across them, we have taken code enforcement action against them. So I don't know the the the full extent of it, but it's the ongoing concern that we have about constitutional challenges that we'd like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to move forward with tonight. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's great. It would just be good to know how many bins we have. I mean, I've seen them here and there, and I know that they can be a blight. And while we figure out the constitutional issues, if we can just get some information back as to where they're located and how many there are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure I would be able to because they are technically unpermitted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I see. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't know. Do we go out and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We go out on a complaint.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Basis? So that complaint information maybe would be sure to give us some sort of idea. I know that. Right. Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Appreciate it. Well, Councilman, you'll be happy to know that many of those complaints are probably mine, because I complain about these things all the time, always emailing staff and so very, very glad councilmember super and I brought this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think these things unfortunately are our blight and they have very little to do with the services being provided and everything to do with graffiti and trash being not picked up around them and they're not maintained and then the resources don't go back into the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I want to thank Councilmember Super not for bringing forward this item. I think it's a really great partnership that we have with the Goodwill. Many people know that Goodwill does not only collect these items for their purpose and mission, but they also do a lot of work, development and a lot of other things in the community'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that the revenues from the donations go to. And so I think it's important that we select our partners wisely. And I think that I have seen where a bin can turn into a mess. And without the types of things that my colleagues have talked about, regular pickups, requirements adjacent to a facility where every morning it can be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'emptied and ensured that it's not at capacity. Also, some people are putting things into the bins and if they are contaminated with bedbugs or other types of things, it contaminates a whole lot of things that it's much better to have a person available like you have at a goodwill store or an AM vet's or any of those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'other options. So I appreciate the item and I'll be supporting it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Councilman Mungo wants to know if we can put the bins in the medians.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yes, thank you, Mayor. Congressman, Super. And I truly, truly, you know, support this item. And I want to tell you, on the last count, I think it was about 40,000 or more. That was only in my district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're working on it. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We had public comment. I appreciate everyone. Please cast your vote.'"
