And there are very few people in in the history of our young city who have done more for not just arts and culture, but for the world of medicine than Robert than Dr. Robert COMBINER Bueno is risky, but ten years ago I began working with the Craftsman Historic Group as well as neighbor, different neighbors'",

        "'speaker_1': 'When this groundbreaking happens later this year, not only will we be eliminating the most dangerous intersection in the city of Long Beach, but we will be creating a new green space adjacent to the Museum of Latin American Art, adjacent to PM, and also creating green space in a community that has very little access to recreation and green'",
        "'speaker_1': 'space. In fact, it is one of the most dense neighborhoods in the city. There are still challenges there. And the fact that there isn't a lot of room in place for for young people to play has always been a challenge for for the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what this will do is we're really taking what was a dangerous intersection and creating a new park. The park will include a small skate park. It will include a top lot for families. It will include open greenspace.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will include opportunities for outdoor art and festivals, as well as areas for people to have a pedestrian walkway and to enjoy this kind of small green area in a really urban urban setting. Also, about a eight or nine months ago, we began a process to come up with a name for the parcel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we had a series of meetings, including a community naming meeting and encourage the community to give their input on what to name the park. The conclusion of that discussion was we that the community and working with our office and other partners really felt that the best way to to honor the incredible legacy of the the the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'main benefactor to this neighborhood an area would be to name the park after Robert Combiner.

        "'speaker_1': 'He has invested when you think about the investment that Dr. Gunn Byner has made to the arts in Long Beach, the way he put Latin American art into the national discussion and made Long Beach the center of that is something that's admirable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This will be the first major public space in the city and in the country named after Dr. Graham Byner. In this way, and I think it's a moment of of celebration for certainly his family, the museum and all of those that have been involved and have been touched by his generosity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to end by saying that I think that Dr. Combiner is certainly best known for his philanthropic contributions. But we should never forget the thousands of people that he helped in Long Beach through his medical practice, through reaching out to low income communities, through the free clinics, through him providing oftentimes free health care to all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of those residents in these in these communities. And so his contributions really stem from not just his philanthropic work, but the work he did to make a Long Beach a healthier place and his vision of of a healthier Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the idea of creating and naming a park, which is the important piece of having a healthy community. After Dr. Gunn Byner, I think makes a lot of sense. So.

        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you know, the this actual naming went through a pretty extensive community process, and this is the name that they decided on. I think there certainly will be ways at the site to honor to honor her. And I and I understand what you're saying, but this is what went through the community process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's one of what I'm presenting to the council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Well, hopefully we'll get the community to to go to the Parks and Rec Commission, because it would be a gross oversight to keep her out of the naming of that park. She's very responsible for his success.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Larry. Good you Kirk as the address. I support 100% with the councilman accountable for the fifth District bishops, he said. I think it was an oversight. I was not involved in that process whatsoever. But I think obtuse would be the word to describe this council's actions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you said if you did not, in fact, remand this back to the process. And had them consider that and then bring that forward. There's nothing to lose that will be there in perpetuity. You don't put it on as a Band-Aid or something or afterthought.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it really I don't know who was responsible for and how this often got, you know, pushed through. There have been a number of dubious things relative to naming people, naming things after people and so forth that haven't been well-thought out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you have an opportunity to to do what I think most people, decent people would expect. And since the barn isn't on fire, remand it back from whence it came, from where it came, and have them revisit that, then bring it forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any further any further comments? Okay. I just want to say I knew Dr. Gunn by her personally, and I have a great deal of respect for his work in this city and his legacy. And so I appreciate the the honor he made me receive.'",
