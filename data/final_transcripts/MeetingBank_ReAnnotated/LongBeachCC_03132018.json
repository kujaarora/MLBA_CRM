        "'speaker_5': 'Before we get into the presentation, I'd like to acknowledge Deputy City Manager Monica Kalita and officer equity manager Katie Balderas, who will be assisting me with the presentation tonight. Get the clear. So to get started to provide context for tonight's discussion, I'd like to share some demographic information about our immigrant population in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More than one in four residents in Long Beach is an immigrant. This includes at least 123,000 naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, temporary migrants, humanitarian migrants and other foreign born residents who were not U.S. citizens at birth. Nearly three quarters of immigrants in Long Beach have been living in the U.S. for 17 or more years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one in three workers in the civilian labor force are immigrants. And over a quarter of Long Beach residents, immigrants are homeowners. And finally, over half of children over half the children in Long Beach have at least one parent born outside of the U.S..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to get right into the item on September 19th, 2017, the city manager received direction from the City Council to partner with immigrant rights organizations to develop a local policy that expands on SB 54 with the following policy considerations in mind protecting and advancing, protecting and advocating for local DOCA and Dreamer students.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Protecting the confidentiality of local immigrant residents and their information. Examining partnerships with the Los Angeles County Fair Local Defense Fund. Preventing future deportations of Long Beach residents. And affirming an aggressive approach to advocating at the federal and state level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For programing. We get policies. Engagement was the starting point for policy developing. Taking time to consider all stakeholder perspectives and to engage a core city. A core team of city staff representing the appropriate expertize from the Health Department's Office of Equity, the Police Department, City Attorney's Office, and the city manager's office was the essential first step in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'effectively assessing all relevant issues and to establish a method for facilitating organization. Community engagement. Doing the policy development process. Community Engagement included a series of listening sessions with key stakeholders led by the Office of Equity in the City Manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our initial session occurred with the Sanctuary Long Beach Coalition on September 29th, a little more than a week after receiving council direction. The Coalition was broadly represented at this initial meeting and we were able to gain some immediate insights from each organization on their concerns and general aspirations for local policy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In a follow up session on October 16, Coalition members presented our team with specific recommendations they would like to see in a city policy. And we all. We also followed up with listening sessions with the Executive Director of Central Chair, Cal State, Long Beach Police Chief, and the Director of the Dream Success Center at Cal State Long'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Beach. Most recently, we held a follow up session with the Coalition on February 13th. So what we heard from the listening sessions is that we should explore the development of a local policy that protects sensitive information and limited use of city resources for assisting enforcement of federal immigration law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also heard that we should consider enhancing access to legal representation for local residents, and also that we should enhance the city's federal and state legislative advocacy. We found these interest to be consistent with the initial city council direction and identify them as core policy considerations for further analysis and development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our report tonight will provide information on each of the core policy considerations, starting with an overview of the proposed local policy. So in developing a policy enveloping the policy under consideration tonight, we evaluated 28 California cities with policies related to immigrant protections.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We compared our current policies and practices with the provisions of SB 54, the policy recommendations of the Sanctuary Long Beach Coalition. And from this analysis, we created an initial draft policy. And at the conclusion of an offer of a final administrative and legal review, we obtained input from the Coalition on the proposed policy in our February 13th'",
        "'speaker_5': 'meeting. All employee associations were notified of the proposed policy on February 27th, and at this point negotiations have not concluded. So as propose, the policy to an administrative regulation would establish limits for requesting and sharing information with immigration authorities and using city resources to assist with immigration enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Here is addressed in the policy include limits on sharing personal and sensitive information, sharing release date information, executing transfers, responding to whole requests, enforcing civil immigration warrants and the use of city facilities. The the proposed policy allows the city to continue collecting information necessary for providing city customers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City services unrelated to immigration enforcement retains the law enforcement exceptions permitted in SB 54 and requires compliance with all relevant federal, state, local laws and regulations, including Title eight of the United States Code, subsection 1373 and 1644. The policy would expand protections for sensitive information beyond citizenship and immigration status by including the additional categories reflected here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The scope of the proposed policy is another area of expansion. SB 54 applies only to law enforcement agencies, whereas the proposed policy would apply to all city manager departments and offices. And in the interests of administrative uniformity, we would ask that the City Council consider requesting other city departments and offices to comply with the post policy or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'similar procedures. We also like to acknowledge that training will be provided to all city departments and offices on the adopted policy. The City Council letter for this item was published on March 5th, and at that time we did not foresee a fiscal impact relating to the implementation of the proposed policy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, on March six, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the State of California regarding three state laws providing immigrant protections, including SB 54 California values that the lawsuit alleges that SB 54 and its policy consistent with it violates Title eight of the United States Code, subsection 1373.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'While this is a matter of interpretation that will only be settled by the courts, we must acknowledge with this new development that that the fiscal impact of the proposed policy is uncertain relating to the continuation of our eligibility for federal grants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Currently, the police department received nearly $6.7 million for Homeland Security and other law enforcement purposes. So now turning to the other consideration, legal representation, enhancing access to legal representation was another policy consideration and it corresponded with the council's initial direction and we were specifically directed to examine partnerships with L.A. County for a local legal defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In response to this direction, staff conducted an analysis of the L.A. Justice Fine, as well as similar initiatives underway in California and throughout the nation. In our analysis, we were able to gain understanding of the outcomes associated with legal representation for immigrants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The most robust evaluation of community based legal representation comes from the very Institute of Justice. The very Institute of Justice works with government, nonprofit partners and communities to increase immigrants access to legal services and improve relationships between immigrant communities and the law enforcement community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Locally, Vera is the evaluator for the L.A. Justice Fund and has provided matching funding for the city of Santa Anna's legal representation for it. In his November 2017 report, the November 2017 Report of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vera found that 48% of immigrants who had proper representation in court were successful in their cases, an increase of 1100 percent between when compared to the 4% success rate for typical unrepresented cases. The evaluation also found that 41% of clients in deportation proceedings had entered the entered or resided in the U.S. legally, either as a legal permanent'",
        "'speaker_5': 'resident or on a visa. Additionally, among parents who received representation in immigrant in immigration proceedings, 86% of their children had some form of legal status, primarily U.S. citizenship. So we also found in our analysis that there are a total of 491 individuals with pending immigration cases who do not have legal representation in Long Beach, Lakewood area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And only 9% of only 9% of individuals with cases filed in the last 90 days have legal representation. These cases are decided much more quickly and are usually unsuccessful. The main object of our analysis was the L.A. Justice Fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The L.A. Justice Plan consists of $7.6 million contributed by the city and county of L.A., the Weingart Foundation and the California Community Foundation, which acts as the fiscal sponsor to administer the fund. In 2017, the foundation granted this money to 17 community based organizations to provide legal services to any eligible L.A. County resident.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, because the L.A. Justice Fund is a countywide resource, there is no way to prioritize Long Beach residents with the fund within the fund. We therefore found that it would not be possible to establish a local fund that prioritizes access to legal representation for Long Beach residents through a direct partnership with the L.A. Justice Fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to complete our analysis on what we thought it would take to feasibly establish a local legal defense fund, we created a conceptual model that could be implemented via public private partnership. To establish this bond. One time seed funding would be required in this model to encourage matching funds from philanthropic and individual sources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This bond could be established with a community foundation who could subsequently conduct an RFP process to select a legal services provider. This approach is similar to the way the L.A. Justice Fund operates. So what could this one do?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At a minimum, the fine could provide legal representation for eligible individuals who are facing detention, deportation or in danger of losing immigration status. Parents who fear deportation and are in need of custody, support for their children under the age of 18.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And those seeking asylum. Young people protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DOCA and other related DEPORT should be taught deportation. Defense support. So who could this fund potentially serve? Also, at a minimum, the fund could provide services for individuals based on residency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People who live or work in the city of Long Beach and income individuals with a household income below 200% of the federal poverty level. This would be equivalent. This would be equivalent of $32,480 for a family of two or $49,200 for a family of four.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So finally tonight, the last consideration relates to legislative advocacy. And the city has affirmed an aggressive approach to advocating at the federal and state levels for pro-immigrant policies. Council approved to approve the 2018 federal and state legislative agendas on January 23rd, including its official position on issues related to immigration, citizenship and DOCA on February 21st, as Congress'",
        "'speaker_5': 'was considering policy changes related to immigration, citizenship and DOCA. The city sent a letter to our federal delegation affirming our city's city council's adopted federal legislative positions on these matters. The city also connects weekly with our state and federal legislative advocates in Sacramento, in Washington, D.C..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have confirmed that at this time there are no legislative proposals on immigration that are under consideration. We will continue to keep an eye out for legislation that is consistent with the city's adopted federal and state legislative agendas to ensure Long Beach remains aggressive in our advocacy efforts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That concludes the staff's presentation on the Long Beach Values Act of 2018.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. I to turn this over to Councilman Gonzales, who was one of the initial initial author to bring this forward. Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I first want to thank everybody for being here. I first have to think quite a few people because I know just talking about it within my office. We've been at this for nearly two years plus, if not more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know many of you have been at this longer than our office has. So we really appreciate all of your work. That includes Central Cha. Thank you so much. They've talked a lot about integration services and they're currently doing all of that work now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sanctuary, Long Beach Coalition, that is a multitude of many coalitions put together and we appreciate all of their work to get these this information together and make sure that we highlight all of the issues remaining about immigration in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our Police Officers Association, Long Beach Police Department and thank you to city staff. Kevin came on board and then we sort of threw him into this this big policy. But I think it was very strategic in the way he presented it.'",

And I want to thank everyone for being here tonight as advocates and for sharing your stories about the impacts of our broken federal immigration system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that there are many hardworking families here in the city of Long Beach. I personally represent over 60% of of families in my district who are Latino. We know that we have the largest Cambodian population outside of the country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is not new news to us. And nearly 30% of our residents identify as foreign born per the 2010 census. But that's who we can count. We know that's probably well more than that. We will be the first city to enact a policy, a local policy where the first largest city to enact a local policy, depending on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what happens tonight after SB 54. And we were actually the very first city to enact our support for SB 54 as it was going through the process. So I want to really thank our state and federal legislative committees, as well as our state and federal government affairs team with Diana Tang in our city management for keeping us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'privy to the ongoing news of SB 54. So as a daughter of an immigrant immigrant, my mom came from our client as Mexico, and I know exactly what many of you are feeling. It took her many years to get naturalized and then become a U.S. citizen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I know that many immigrant families now, whether wherever you come from, we need to certainly build a city here of inclusivity and a city where you know that you're welcomed. And we know currently that many ICE raids are occurring.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And whatever happens tonight, I have to be I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but I have to just be very crystal clear here, whatever passes tonight. And I'm hopeful that will pass something that will absolutely protect our immigrants that still, unfortunately, does not deter federal agents from coming in and deporting our neighbors, our'",

        "'speaker_3': 'are the are immigrants themselves are children of immigrants. I actually work for one of the largest corporations. And what I was so excited about was that they put forward their support for immigrant employees. And we know we have many of them here as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in fact, many local business owners over this last year who generally are very conservative, you know, we know what side of the aisle they're on came to me in comments. And told me that they really wanted to see a local policy passed because they knew that their workforce, many of them who were undocumented, would hit their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bottom line. And for whatever reason, they cared for this policy. They told me in confidence that this was very important to them as well. Many people have different opinions on this, but as I mentioned, we have a city that has an obligation to stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters and ensure that they have every opportunity to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'make a positive impact, not just with this policy, but with future years to come. That means continuing to help them with naturalization and citizenship. That means continuing to help them at Long Beach Unified School District with educational resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That means continue to work with our faith based partners, many of which, you know, in my the Catholic Church that I attend, the priest there is actually holding many of the birth certificates and medical documents in order to help immigrant families so that if anything happens, they have all their necessary documentation in one place and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First I'd like to say as well that we know that the federal government is coming down on California pretty hard. And we know that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is coming down on California very hard due to sanctuary city policies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we just heard in the staff report that there are some concerns. And although we want don't want to say that these concerns are not going to happen because many federal courts have shot them down and local courts have shot them down, we know that it's still a concern for our city funding, despite the best efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that we have several federal cases in the past that have affirm this legal issue, that it is on constitutional for them to come down on California so hard. For example, in April 2017, San Francisco and Santa Clara County versus Donald Trump, U.S. District Judge William Orrick filed an injunction against President Trump's executive order trying to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'strip funding away from local cities, passing sanctuary policies. And in his opinion, which is one of many opinions, the constitution vests the spending powers in Congress, not the president. So the executive order cannot constitutionally place new conditions on federal funds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as 60% of immigrants have been here for at least a decade or more, about $13 billion of their payroll taxes rolled into our systems while receiving little to no benefit. And many of us know this whether you're students, you're an employee, we know that you're giving to the system, but unfortunately not seeing much in return.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while the federal government is currently suing the state of California, particularly challenging the state rights as granted in the 10th Amendment over SB 54 and other immigrant immigration related bills, I'm confident that we will be able to prevail in court as a state and as the first city in California to support SB 54.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's certainly the spirit of this bill to lend our support and funding for a Long Beach Values Act and for residents of all different backgrounds and of all different spaces in the city. So I'm going to leave my comments there for now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will lend my comments to Councilmember Pearce. I see a few people queuing up as well and then we'll go from there. But I want to say thank you again for being here and then we'll go forward with some motions and recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That was the that was the make or make of the motion. I'm not I'm not sure if those guys were welcome to clap, but whoever's making those noises just just now, actually, you have a chance to do your time, sir.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please, just, you know, clapping or silence. Next up is Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Lena Gonzalez. And thank you, everybody, that is here today. I see a packed house and I know that for many of you that are here in this room, you, you, yourself or someone in your family might be undocumented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And coming out of this council meeting is, in fact, a step of stepping out of a place of fear and into courage. And so I just want to give you guys a round of applause for that. Yes, definitely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'America was built on immigrants, right? America was built on immigrants. And part of what we know is that national and international policies often dictate the movement of people. Right. Sometimes people ask me, what am I doing in my sociology degree?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's understanding how institutions and structures have an effect on people. And so we know that people come to our country for something better. We know that people make risk and leave families behind for something better. And we know that families live here for 20 and 30 years, sometimes before something happens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And like the gentleman that was at Cal State, Long Beach, who had a record, which I'm sure somebody here will speak to from 20 years prior, turned his life around and made a difference and ended up being deported, leaving his entire family back here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I look forward to hearing your story, your stories of courage. I want to thank the staff for their work on this. I think, you know, it's good to kind of see where the baseline is. But I do have a lot of concerns, as I've vocalized to many of you, with having something that looks similar to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'SB 54. So I look forward to hearing some recommendations from my colleagues. I look forward to hearing from you all in the audience today. I definitely support a financial fund, and I think having a conversation around how we have that, how much that fund should be is really important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But above all, I want to make sure that I'm advocating on behalf of every resident, whether they're a registered voter or not in our city, and that we know that our justice system is often flawed. And that is not a statement about one police officer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is not a statement about Long Beach's police department. That is a statement around the American justice system that we too often have people of color that are imprisoned or pulled over. And I don't want that flawed system to break somebody's life and put them back in a country where they might not know anybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I hope that tonight, through the conversations that we get to a place where you can leave here feeling protected and like Long Beach has gone above and beyond what the state has done. And that's where I'll leave my comments now and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We are okay. We're going to go move on to public comment and then we'll have other debate and discussion from the council. So please line up and please make sure you say your name for the record and we will begin public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, Mr. Pete, you know, we start. I got to get my phone right. Okay. Robert, Pete, represent Jesus Christ. Only one that sits around here. That's some bullcrap. And you advocating for people of color, you don't give a damn about a nigger.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's all you are is a communist. And you for illegals, you don't care about black people. Maybe you shouldn't even done this. I ain't never gonna forget this. And anybody who votes for this, this ain't no damn mafia matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, especially black dudes. I mean, they don't gave $99 billion last year due to illegal aliens to 1.4 trillion since 2015. And now we give them people who don't deserve one damn dime. Now, I love I have a lot of people that undocumented I love.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But hey, what about us? What about us? I'm here for my people, too. But I will never hear. I'll never be a socialist talking about nothing for us. Let's. I'm saying what I want. Don't ask me up, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You came out here. You came on as a Republican and you backstab and you, Benedict Arnold, people over here, you got money from people I know you liar. You. When did you just see? I'm talking to you. I'm just talking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You shut the hell up. Hey, so. So, yeah. Address the. And then you tell her. Don't talk about the issue. I'm saying what I have to say. No, I don't like none of this. You get your ass back to Peru and do this shit or whatever, you know, don't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Don't do it here. This is America red, white and blue. So you ain't doing it out of a damn about none of them. Tell them to shut up. Yea. Yea. Yea. Yea. Yea. You're going to get on the dance floor, but then you do it, so you're going to be asked for that anyway.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Your time is up, sir. Thank you very much. Okay. Mr.. Mr.. Gucci, before you speak of just 1/2.

        "'speaker_0': 'It's been well documented in the courts. And so we will continue on the three minute time period. And we'll begin with Mr. Goode here. Mr. Goode, who praised my pragmatic solution to this issue, is that those people who are considered in South Dakota.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Should line up, put their name on a list if they're not there already. And then what they need to do is get in line behind those who have been in this country legally.

        "'speaker_0': 'But what you have to do is get in line. Wait your turn. And for those people that want to pay for these people, they can certainly do so. But the government should not be forced to pay for illegal.'",

My version of being separated from their children while they're being separated from their husbands, daughters separated from their mothers and grandmothers.

Frankly, we never voted to empower you to tear a family apart or to deport good people who are here without family. I want to take a moment and recognize there are wonderful people who have no living family right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think this is too much power for any elected for any person in office. But here we are. Families and loving people are exactly what we need here in the USA, now more than ever. It's exactly what we need here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tonight you can open up your arms and wrap them around this wonderful city and say you are safe here. Creating and sustaining a defense fund is your privilege to vote on that tonight. Way beyond Judy. Honestly, I think that no one should have this unholy right to break up a family.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'When I was 16, I became parents. I wound up pushed out of school. I wound up in the streets and I wound up in the juvenile justice system only to wind up in prison. And so this is in 1998 and 1999.'",

It's all about taking money away from families. So where does the money to support these families going to come from after that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't come from them. They have to find a different way. All it does is perpetuate the underground economy. That's why I told you where they're going to go, because they have no other means to pay the rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Same with me. I got in trouble because I made it for myself. There was no resources in the community. Nothing going on. Went to school. They idea. Here's your paper. Turn in your book. Goodbye. That's not a way to deal with the problems.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And if we want to punish people by sending them away, that doesn't address the problem, because that's still the case that somebody was hurt, the community was hurt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The solutions are in resourcing the community, so those things don't happen to begin with. So that's a real solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But on any note, I just want to say something about people. What human nature? Illegal? Who would Jesus deport, if you want to talk about it from a Christian value perspective? And lastly, there are roughly a thousand people that are in our military, the US military doctor.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Our broken national immigration system is racist. It is deeply rooted in the sin of racism because it excludes people of color from opportunities to pursue safety and dream of a better future. It's racist because it dehumanizes people of color as criminals instead of dignifying them as people created in the image of God.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Carving out people with criminal history from our ordinance is another way of degrading people of color who are vulnerable to economic insecurity. Many individuals with criminal history, committed crimes years ago for which they have done their due, have done their time.'",

This is the opportunity this Long Beach Values Act needs to be with our carve out and to see us now as collateral and to be part of this beautiful, diverse city where we have invested in the justice lab for the formerly incarcerated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Today, we need a Clean Values Act. Period. Roberto Council members, please pass a Clean Values Act. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Let's look at this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. You know, Mr. Pete, you cannot keep talking when people are speaking like now. No one else is talking to the people who are speaking. So now I've now warned you three times. I mean, just for the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Patty Diaz. I'm a board member of the Long Beach Interfaith Community District eight. I'm looking at District eight and whom has an organization who has always been committed to protect immigrants and their families, especially with the current Trump administration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has definitely become a top priority. With that being said, we have created Media Watch, a hotline of volunteers that provides them with approximately eight dispatchers, 50 rapid responders, their guides and supports them when facing ICE raids, which are happening a lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By the way, one of my biggest concerns is legal representation. We appreciate you putting your toes in the water with this sanctuary and sanctuary ordinance, one which values act of $100,000. However, what we are asking is that you jump into the water with us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We believe 600,000 will say to our Long Beach immigrant community that you are committed and all the way in it with us as a faith based organization. All of our religious traditions believe and stand for second chances being essential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Furthermore, another concern is a carve out picking and choosing who is disturbing and who is not. Isn't there a legal justice system already in place? If so, then why should our community members be punished twice for the same mistake or the offense?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you want to call it that, we some of you may remember who say Alvarez case, a family man deported for a broke until late. Many of you publicly supported his return. However, Mr. Alvarez would not have been included in this proposed defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These cases are complicated and many, too many to count. Therefore, they need legal representation because a city filled with immigrants and need your support in dealing with unjust immigration policies. We hope you take a stand and walk this journey with us in making Long Beach a sanctuary city and definitely raising our fund for the immigration community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next picture, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Swimming Chair and I'm a senior staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. And like many of the people here, I stand before you to really urge you to pass a clean Long Beach Values Act.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city should not cave in to any kind of bullying or intimidation by the federal government either. We know that Sessions and Trump are going after jurisdictions that they consider to be sanctuary jurisdictions, and many places are standing strong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not only is our governor and attorney general of California standing strong, we've also seen recently across the country places continue to pass strong measures. So just two weeks ago, King County, Washington, passed a sanctuary ordinance that has no carve outs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That includes no carve outs in terms of who they notify around notifying ice about people's release dates and no carve outs in terms of transferring people to ice. So I urge Long Beach to do something like that. This should be a race to the top, not to the bottom.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should all be in competition to have the strongest policy possible and not just count on SB 54 to do everything because it has its limitations. SB 54 was a compromise bill that factored in more conservative areas of California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, here in Long Beach, which, as you well know, is an extremely diverse place. It's a very progressive city. And so we should be doing better. I also wanted to share that I was formerly on the Board of Committee Growth and Action, and I had many Cambodian clients here in Long Beach who are facing deportation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you've heard firsthand some of the very painful personal stories of that experience. And I also wanted to reemphasize that that, unfortunately, is all too common. I saw many of my young clients get caught up in overpolicing, the overcriminalization of youth and of people of color in the nineties and early 2000s.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They were pushed into surviving by joining groups of people for self-defense, which are then labeled gangs. They were then put into the criminal justice system and forced to take plea bargains many times. This was a time, too, when people were not informed of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to criminal convictions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So many people took guilty pleas not knowing that this will lead to their automatic deportation. And when they got in front of an immigration judge, often they were unrepresented or they faced the pressures of being in detention and decided to take a deportation order in order to get out as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So those people I knew who are lucky enough to win their case and get out of detention, they've come back into the community. They've gotten married, they've had children. One of them just recently opened up a cell phone business here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is what's possible if we give people a second chance. And therefore, I want to urge you again, please pass a Clean Values Act and do not have any carve outs for people. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, everyone. I'm Bernice Osorio, and I'm a lawyer. I came to the U.S. to study a masters of law at UCLA. I was born and raised in Mexico City, as well as my whole family. However, since the day that I arrived here, I couldn't avoid feeling empathetic and identified with the people establishing California who shared my same'",
        "'speaker_2': 'roots. I believe that the only way that people can take action is to speak out through their use of the law. That's why. Grant Currently, I'm also part of the UCLA immigrants rights policy, and we are working together with the Long Beach Centauri Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So here we are today in order to support this century Long Beach Coalition to speak on behalf of the immigrant community against carve outs for notification and transfer requests to ICE. These carve outs suggest ongoing collaboration with immigration enforcement on the fullest extent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They lead to a mistaken perception of immigrants as undesirable. Exercising control over certain groups of immigrants creates an oppressive environment that turns intolerable. This situation also generates racism, discrimination that turns into a social disintegration. Families are the foundation of a strong society and DNA part A home is not the way to build a united community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Assisting immigration enforcement simplifies ice school or deporting undocumented immigrants efficiently. As a result, the immigrant community becomes an easy target for a violation of civil and human rights. So that's the reason why we ask for a clean Long Beach values ordinance without carve outs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because immigrants make an important contribution to the country and because this is an opportunity to extend to them the protections that they deserve. Also, we ask for a Clean Values Act with no carve outs because it will offer harmony and acceptance to everyone in the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh. Well, I start this and I'm going to ask how America is so little. I go viral and after a love me, they look what tragic loss all of the U.S. has become as an audience. I mean, I'm in Gaza and Muslim enterprise in the middle and so follows those two systems.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But those pile up of similar deportation. We see Hillary will go near no extra silos. But let's start with Alaska, Walla Walla Walla. Just I mean, if we look at the members of Plan A, we see a lot of instability and really stress for our society.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So until I see the media, Estabrook Studios see that I'm in Gaza. So whether you get to or through Solaris and I am most careful in front of my local LA Policia opponents, you know, and then I just in the almost when I caught it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm asymptomatic and you're welcome. A policia necesita. But you're still up by know I look for the Jacksonville Annapolis here in any attempt. Yes, I get they know the man they were there but it could upset Pakeha by that also.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'The family can access. My name is America and I am a leader of ICA. I live in North Long Beach and I have four children. One of them is a Dhaka recipient. A few days ago, ice came to my house and since that day, my whole family lives in fear and we are prepared for a possible deportation'",
        "'speaker_2': '. My children live in fear and stress in the afternoons when I pick them up from school and if I arrive late, they fear that I have been deported. My children should not be subjected to this stressful situation. They are citizens of this country and the only concern they should have should be for their education.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I could come to my house, I'm sure they'll be able to go to yours as well. We believe that they were informed by their police or a neighbor since we have a court case. It is important to me to be able to trust the police when I need them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if they are going to support ICE, I can trust them. Any immigrant, whether they have a criminal record or not, should be able to stay since they've already paid their debt. I understand that the city cannot tell ICE to leave our streets, but they can prevent deportation by prohibiting the police from collaborating with ICE.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please. Thank you, Mayor Garcia. Council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd also like to thank the tangle of people on whose land we are gathered. My name is Joe Berra. I'm clinical faculty at UCLA Law School. I directed the Immigrant Rights Policy Clinic. We've had the privilege this semester of working with the Long.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Act or the Long Beach Values Act, given the recent lawsuit filed by Attorney General Sessions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't want this to be a constitutional class, but we all are aware that the Constitution defines our federal system, and the 10th Amendment specifically protects states and local government from the federal government's attempts to intrude on local sovereignty and to commandeer local government.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Resources and authority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Similarly, there are certain fields of law, and specifically immigration law, which are the sole authority of the federal government. And so local law enforcement has no role in immigration enforcement unless allowed for or delegated by the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But by the same token, and at the same time, the federal government cannot force or commandeer local law enforcement to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Assist the federal immigration enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I can say, along with over 100 law professors who wrote a letter to Governor Brown.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The California Values Act, and by extension, a clean Long Beach Values Act does not violate the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Law and that lawsuit will not prevail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do come here to speak in favor of a clean Long Beach Values Act without any carve outs. It's not only good law, it's good policy. What is the role of state and local government.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With respect to our immigrant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Community? I would argue that it is integration and not removal. Removal has been a sad part.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of our history.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's affected. State and local actors have been involved in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Removal since the beginning of our history.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The farmers and settlers in Georgia pushed the federal government to remove Native Americans. Legislatures in Mississippi and Louisiana passed Jim Crow laws to remove African-Americans to the north. Businessmen in San Francisco pushed the federal government to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Remove Chinese and the Chinese Exclusion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Act. We should be about integration and not removal. The carve outs have nothing to do with criminal justice. They have only to do with removal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And therefore, I ask you for a clean Long Beach Values Act with no carve out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I expect the please.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'He reminded me, is crazy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, this country has had a long history of being a century. You know, our one point there was boats of rapists and murderers and thieves and they allowed them to settle in. And that became the state of Georgia, you know, for a fact.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. He had three warnings of four others and he says, let.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me do what I got to do now. You can do what you gotta do. I'm here. I'm here to represent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, a part of the story that isn't really you don't see as much today. You know, my father is an immigrant from the war torn country, destroyed by as many people in this room, completely destroyed by American imperialism.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My father grew up in Ethiopia.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, so most of his childhood was spent dodging American bombs, American missiles, American tanks, American mortars. And after, you know, this country spent the seventies and eighties destroying my father's country, he had the great opportunity of being able to come here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He met my mother here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I you know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unfortunately, he came in 87, 86, the last Republican president at the time, Mr. Reagan, he was actually the last person to pass amnesty law. So because my father came a year late after his refugee status was expired, because what was once an American enemy became an American ally, he was suddenly an undocumented immigrant, as many people are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in his country. You know, borders changed and laws change, and what was legal becomes illegal and vice versa. And its impact on my family, specifically my older cousins, an older cousin of mine who was in his teen years, you know, arrested with possession of a narcotics marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Years later, he was deported and sent back to Ethiopia, where he unfortunately was conscripted into the military and died fighting in a war. And that's an unfortunate case for a lot of Cambodians. I know as well as the Salvadoran people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I grew up here who get sent back to war torn countries or countries with regimes that don't necessarily like the people who are coming back and they have to face the consequences. So the idea that being born here and, you know, the travesties of growing up here, you should have to be affected by it later is is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a travesty. So I don't believe in the carve out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Madam Speaker, please. Hello. My name is Myron Wolin. I am the president of the Long Beach Gray Panthers. I am also a member of CLU, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice and a proud member of Migrant Watch, which you've just been told about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to compliment the Council for just for taking up the issue and going as far as you have in going for a Long Beach Values Act. If you were to be commended for that. However, you need to reconsider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No carve out. You need to go beyond what you've talked about now and think about what it means. Think about the stories you've heard and how it affects the people of Long Beach. Now, I want to tell you a little something about my history and why I am in favor of a Long Beach Values Act with no'",
        "'speaker_0': 'carve outs. Mike. I am the son of immigrants, as many of you are. My mother came here when she was three months old from England. My father came here from Poland before 1924. He was escaping a anti-Semitic environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He was coming here to better himself economically. Now, why do I keep saying 1924, 1924 was when our country first limited immigration aside from the Chinese Exclusion Act. But for everyone else in the country, in the world, it became an exclusionary policy of immigration prior to 1924.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anybody could come here to this country. And that's why my father was able to come here. And that's why my mother was able to come here. And that's why many people many white people are here because they came here before 1924.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In 1924 was a racist law. It said that the immigration policy should be based on the what the census was in 1890. Why did they choose 1890? Because after 1890, many of my people came here to this country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Many of the southern Europeans came here to this country. And many of the Eastern Europeans came here in this country. The history of immigration in this country is a history of racism. It's a history of trying to deny this country to do to have its citizens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why I'm saying, although I wouldn't say that if you vote for exclusionary thing, you're necessarily racist. But consider the fact that there is racism in this country. We have a country that talks about shithole countries. And what is that part of?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's part of a racist philosophy. Thank you. Thank you for your time. I speak. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Yeah. Chuck Brewer, first district. I'll give you a little history for 25 years. I ran a staffing company. We grew to 600 locations around the country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'During that time, we had a creative was everyone who was colorblind. So where I grew up, I grew up in Chicago and I understand racism. What I'm going to tell you right now, I've also watched in my 65 years a lot of that dissolve.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are a nation that is evolving. Yes, we are. So with that being said, I would just like to say, oh, by the way, I have I had family that fought in the Civil War for the North.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had family that fought a war to. I family fought the war of 1812, but they were for the Canadians didn't what the Americans have come over the border. So let's go to a real simple thing here. I am very empathetic to every one of the stories told here today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know what it's like to put a paycheck in someone's hands and give them economic opportunity. But our company that we grew to $1,000,000,000 sales, over 600 locations was subject to be fined for breaking immigration hiring laws. So we went to verification where other didn't just so we would not be fined.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I say to you here, I believe that there are a lot of fine, but we moved to the city because it's culturally diverse. Not Irvine, Long Beach. And I've been here for over 40 years. Longer than that, actually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I say to Patrick West, to our city attorney, to you all. Don't be the cool city. Be the city that does not break the laws but changes the laws. The laws need to be changed through lobbyists. They need to be changed through our states.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We we all who have the privilege to vote, have the opportunity to put people in the representation to change the law by us as a city. Breaking the law. That is wrong. Should we and our last city attorney allow anyone to go through a red light this week to be in sanctuary if I don't pay my taxes'",
        "'speaker_0': '? Do I get a sanctuary from the city because I don't like to pay my taxes? I pay them because it's part of my responsibility. So I say to you, yes, we need change, but it needs to be done legally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Don't be just the cool city. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Would you mind grabbing the mic for. We can hear you. That would be great. Thank you. So there we go. There you go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Senior Year. Why you? I'm nine years old and my dad died in in Mexico a few years ago when I was drinking a lot. The only family I have is my mom. And I went to see there that my mom came from Mexico and headed to California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I didn't want to say that and that I don't want those people, most people to take away my mom because the only family I have is my mom. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Melissa Gomez. I am 15 and I am a member of Saint Athanasius Church and I call and to start this off, I want to say I am proud to be part of the Hispanic community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we all know my parents came to the United States for a better life, only they know why they left their home, their hometown, and and then sending them back is is unfair because only they know why they left.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they came here to give out to get a better life, to give my brothers and sisters a better life. And we we all know at least one or more families that don't have papers are immigrants. They keep they all came here for a reason.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They all should have oh, they should all have the rights to be here, live freely, to live without fear. Because I know at least I know many families with that with are immigrants live in fear and I don't want that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was born here. I'm a citizen. But yet it hurts me to know, to see those families being deported because I may not be related to them by blood, but I am related to them through God because I am.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the way they they're separating their families, their children, kids my age, younger than me. And it hurts me seeing that a hearing about stories, how they've been deported, how some of them don't have parents, no family. And that is just very devastating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope you guys support and to protect the immigrants. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'As we we recommend that Long Beach law enforcement review any active joint task forces with the Department of Homeland Security and also in the future use discretion in any possible joint task force. This current California Values Act does not allow local police departments to work with ICE specific or with Department of Homeland Security specifically for immigration purposes'",
        "'speaker_2': '. However, frequently a loophole used is for human trafficking and for drug enforcement. However, the National Immigration Immigrants Women's Advocacy Project has shown that communities are less likely to want to work with police departments if if they are at work, if they know that they are working with ICE.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'here at this point without their dedication. I have to say I am disappointed that we haven't been able to work and have the same as close of a relationship with all the council offices. I think we've had a really difficult time and I think one of the results of that is this line of folks here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think the other thing too is that we value is the inclusion, right? Inclusion of our Cambodian community, which we know is very politically divided. There is not one councilmember here that has a majority of the Cambodian population, and that's why we stand in solidarity, whether Latinos black and in solidarity with the Cambodian community to not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be left out of this. And I get it. This is a hard decision for you all. And I'll be honest, we don't have I know chief love of here before we've been in the meetings with PD. We don't have the political clout that they have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have the community. We have the courage to come here, share our stories, and talk about what's real and what the impact is to our community. So I implore you, please support this with no carve outs, a fully funded deportation defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I had gained two accounts on the day. Now we're going to go ahead to the council that they now have. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. We're going to go ahead and go back to the the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do have some people that are cued up and sort of go through the debate. And I just ask everyone, of course, is to be respectful of folks as folks are are speaking and allow everyone to give their their points of view in the comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm sure there's going to be some questions back and forth as well. And so first up is Councilwoman Rice.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I have a few notes that should be displayed in just a second here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To go through.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I appreciate everyone coming out and for all of your comments and regardless of what we do tonight and I look forward to what we do tonight, I think it's important. I mean, I certainly can only control what you do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You can't control what others do. But I think it's really important that we stay away from things like calling people who don't agree with us, white supremacists and things like that. I just I think that is not very helpful to the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you guys, guys, listen, everyone everyone is getting a chance to speak. And I just asked you guys, please just be respectful of now the council's debating and so we've please everyone has a chance to speak council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would say on the thoughts about having good relationships, it's interesting that one would get booed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They've even talked about what their position is on something just because they don't like what what someone doesn't like what they're hearing. So it's especially from our religious leaders. So let's try to be respectful in this conversation. We are a very diverse city and we have residents all over the city who have thoughts and opinions and concerns'",
        "'speaker_7': 'about things. Today, my office received between yesterday and today, when the Press Telegram article came out over 100 emails, I believe almost all of them were an emphatic no on tonight's vote. And I think there's a lot of misinformation on behalf of a lot of residents in regards to what we're voting on tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I want to do a little bit of clarifying on that so that the biggest concerns that have been expressed by my residents is a request that we vote no on sanctuary cities. And I think that it's really clear to me that there is no official definition of what a sanctuary city is and what that means.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some of my residents have believe that it means things that it really doesn't. In my opinion, what I believe the term means, as it's been implemented by over 300 jurisdictions in the United States, is that it limits information sharing between local authorities and federal authorities, which I support.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is no legal definition for it. And again, there's a great deal of misinformation about it and the context of tonight. We are a city of immigrants. Several of you pointed out how many of us are immigrants and several of you talked about the different backgrounds that some of us have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I for one, I was born in America, but I went back to the country of Iran as a baby with my mother and my father. And in 1979, my mother and I left the country because there was a political revolution taking place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we left behind my father and my sister and I was separated from them and did not see them for over 20 years and I was reunited with my sister about 13 years ago. I share that with you because sometimes it's really, really easy to pick apart things that you don't like or support things that you do'",
        "'speaker_7': 'like. But I think it's really important that we step away for just a moment of advocacy and realize that we are all citizens. Many of us are citizens of this city, and we're doing our very best to walk along this journey side by side.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And at the end of the day, as Rumi, one of my favorite poets, has said, we are all walking each other home. And I think that's really important to think about as we're going through this dialog, because we may not agree on everything.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'll I'll share with you a little bit of what I'm talking about. So this is really for my residents. I will do a little bit of an education for for the over 100 people who reached out to my office and asked me to vote no on this item, which I'll tell you in a moment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do plan to support the item and why, but every city in the state of California has to follow state law, and that is a requirement. And that's necessary, of course. And SB 54, which passed, really went through a great deal of changes to get to the place that it did its original.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Version. And those of you who are here and some of you may have heard me then who might be booing me tonight, really didn't like some of the comments I made about SB 50 Four's original introduction. And it turns out it wasn't just me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Local law enforcement leaders and even our governor didn't like the original version of SB 54. And that's why it was amended to a place that I think makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense to me, and it includes the law enforcement exception.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But SB 54 is limited to law enforcement agencies only, and I think that it should be expanded as the staff proposal recommends to all city departments. For those of you who don't know and again for any of my residents watching at home.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'SB 54 allows a law enforcement official to have discretion to cooperate with federal immigration officials by detaining an individual on the basis of immigration hold after an individual becomes eligible for release from custody. Only if the continued detention of the individual on the basis of immigration hold would not violate any federal, state or local law or any'",
        "'speaker_7': 'other local policies, and only under the following circumstances. And it lists approximately enumerates approximately 34, I think it's 35 crimes, including felony DUIs, which for those who are familiar with with my career as a prosecutor, was a really important concept for me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I support fully support those law enforcement exceptions. Many people don't know this. And again, this is for a lot of my residents who are at home who don't know and understand that immigration status is not something that is at all considered in the context of local criminal prosecution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Prosecutors and I've been one for almost 19 years, never know the citizenship status of victims or defendants. It's absolutely irrelevant to our core function, which is was there a crime committed and who committed the crime? That's the limited focus of local law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so the immigration status of the individual is irrelevant and should not be known to prosecutors and law enforcement. I believe that very strongly. Over the course of my career, I have represented the people of the state of California and domestic violence cases and rape cases and in murder cases.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I have helped thousands of people through the trainings that I've done in my office on helping victims and witnesses apply for U visas so they could stay in the country after cooperating on a criminal prosecution. That's not me just talking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's me actually doing. I've sat across the table from victims of domestic violence, and I've helped them stay in this country after they have cooperated with law enforcement. And I'm so proud of those efforts. Having said that, I've also prosecuted many, many white American born evil people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in my opinion, immigration status is absolutely irrelevant to the concept of whether someone committed a crime and what crime they committed. I do believe that the fear of deportation, that information is shared will result in less victims and witnesses cooperating with police officers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I am a proud justice seeker. I got into the job because I wanted to fight for victims of crime. I don't care what their immigration status says. They're going to get 1,000% of my efforts and I want them to help us solve crimes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I feel very strongly about that. So I learned my lesson with the hotel item. So I'm going to make a few things really, really clear because I don't want someone to come back later and say Suzy Price doesn't like immigrants because that's not the case.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I just want this to be clear. I support the exceptions which allow information to be shared under SB 54. And as a prosecutor, I know what it means for someone to be convicted of the very serious crimes listed, the crimes enumerated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It doesn't involve arrests, it's convictions only. And so to me, that makes a huge difference. And I do support that. The proposed values act as as as presented by council has three components, if I understand it correctly. The first is that city departments should follow the current guidelines of SB 54 that the city should provide financial support'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for a legal defense fund. This is the one area I'm going to talk about that I have an opposition to and that the city should allow for federal and state legislative advocacy, which I fully support. I do not support using taxpayer dollars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Public funds to fund a legal defense fund. And I'll tell you why. Using city finances to fund a legal defense, in my opinion, is in violation of our city charter, even if it's not the city attorney who's actually advocating on behalf of the individual.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe that the intent of our charter is to limit our functions as a city and limit to what we can do in terms of municipal affairs. Currently, the city cannot enforce or defend against against laws on behalf of those who are not employed in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's actually in our city charter under Section 603. I think what's being proposed through the staff policy, in my opinion, my personal opinion is in violation of the intent of the charter. Let's take, for example, the situation where we ask our city attorney to defend against an action for the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the city attorney contracts out with a public I mean, with a private law firm to do that city attorney work. Our charter and the limitations of our charter would apply to the firm that we have hired to work on behalf of the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That firm cannot represent an individual in a legal action by going through a nonprofit organization, which, by the way, the staff report, as great as it is, is completely void of any details of how this financial allocation would work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I would be urging my colleagues not to vote on that tonight anyway. There's no implementation plan. It's unclear to me what nonprofit is going to get the money. In the past, we have allocated large sums of money, and I know $100,000 isn't a large sum of money, but in the past we've allocated large sums of money'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for causes that I've expressed concern about, and there's been applause that's been erupted in the council chambers. But I would ask folks who applauded in those situations, do you feel that the city's allocation of that large sum of money has moved the needle on that issue?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I tell.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You, it has not, because we didn't identify exactly how that money was going to be spent or where it was going to go. In my opinion, allocating the money the city tax dollars to a nonprofit to implement a legal defense fund is a way to get out creatively, get around the intent of our charter, which is city'",
        "'speaker_7': 'money should be used to defend the city and city employees if it's going to be used for legal action. It's not the intent of our charter that we allocate taxpayer dollars for individual legal battles. So just to be clear, I do not believe that we should use public funds to support individual legal issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So my vote tonight will be and I want to hear from my colleagues, but I think my vote is going to be I support following SB 54 because it is the law. I support staff's recommendation to expand the law so that all city departments cannot share information as to immigration status only.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I support staff's recommendation, which does not eliminate the law enforcement exception that allows information sharing in the three or four enumerated circumstances. And I do not support using city funds to fund a legal defense fund. So at this point, I know there's been a motion and a second, but I would like to make a substitute motion that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we adopt the recommendations of staff. Absent the legal fund portion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's a that's a motion. Is there a second on that motion? Okay. There's there's a second on the motion. So that's a now substitute motion. We still have people cued up and we're just going to go right through the queue and hear from other folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up is Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So thank you all again so much for being here, telling us your stories, talking about your advocacy for this issue. It certainly, you know, means a lot to many of us on the council, whether we are or we come from immigrant families or not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this is an issue that all of us have to be aware of and care about, not just because I'm Latina, but because it should matter to all of us. We have neighbors who are being affected. We have friends who are being affected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know we know the stories. We've seen them. We've heard them. We've looked at them on TV. And clearly there's an issue here. Now, I actually have a a line of questioning for chief for our police department. I don't know if Chief Luna is going to respond to those questions, because I do believe that we need to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'clarify a lot of what is out there. There is a lot of misinformation. And I want all of us to understand that this policy we're putting forward is to support immigrants as much as we possibly can. And I do believe in a legal defense fund, which I will talk about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So first, I want to get some clarifying answers to the questions that I have for our police department. Of course, we know what SB 54 includes, but a lot of us know what it looks like on paper. But we don't know the exceptions, the situations that were in, in order for us to really realize what we can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and cannot do as a police department and also as a city department. So first and foremost, and I appreciate you, Chief Luna, for being here today. I first want to ask you, because there's quite a few questions here, and so I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please bear with me. I think this is all very, very important for us. First question, as it relates to making arrests on civil immigration warrants, can you explain a civil immigration warrant how that differs from a criminal warrant in terms of live PD participation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council and specifically to council member Lena Gonzalez. The way that differs is we don't enforce civil law as a police department. Civil immigration warrants can be issued by a nice agent. A criminal warrant needs to be issued by a judge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We actually in our department currently have a special order that explains the difference to our employees between a civil warrant through NCIC, which ICE issues and criminal matters that we deal with. I'm looking for the special order. Give me a quick second here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I'm just going to paraphrase it if if that's okay, because I know we've been here a long time on this, but anyways, it does describe what a civil detainer is and just reading from it, it says Unless immigration status is relevant to another criminal offense, the fact that an individual is suspected of being a non-citizen should'",
        "'speaker_0': 'not be used as a sole basis for contact, detention or arrest. That's primarily what the special order calls for. The next paragraph deals when when we do assist other law enforcement agencies, including ICE.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. So I just want to summarize and make clear that we are not actively enforcing civil civil immigration warrants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not ask people in the three situations I named. We don't ask people for their immigration status even when we arrest people. We are not asking them for their immigration status. We are arresting people for criminal charges.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Statues under the penal code. Vehicle code at times. And welfare and institutions code. Nothing to do with civil immigration process. We do not do that here at the Long Beach Police Department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And that is clearly stated in the special order, as you as you mentioned. That's correct. Okay. The second question I have and this has been sort of not clear and I wanted to get clear on this as well, was does the LAPD affirm that they do not ask about citizens ship status, as you mentioned'",
        "'speaker_3': ', but specifically, are we inquiring about country of birth at any time?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as stated prior, ma'am, we do not ask people for immigration status on these routine contacts, detention or arrest. There are some instances where we will ask people the country of origin. But I think that's a citywide thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the only two instances I could think of is for pre-employment applications if somebody is applying for the position of police officer. We obviously ask them what their immigration status is and then when we get into U visas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Pryce talked about the U. Visa program. Obviously, that is an effort to assist somebody who's an immigrant who's been a victim of a crime. We're going completely out of the way to assist in those situations. Now, you asked about the place of birth, which is a little different than immigration status in our booking forms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is an L.A. County booking form. There is a box there that we have to fill in that asks for place of birth. There is no follow up questions after the place of birth to somebodys immigration status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And can you. So you've said I don't know if everybody understands certainly the process of the U visa. I understand it is for immigrant residents who want to receive a visa to stay in this country if they were a victim of a crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And do they divulge the information? Are we. I just want to make sure we the process is clear on what that visa is and what the process is in terms of obtaining that information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So are you visas an immigration benefit that can be sought by victims of certain crimes who are currently assisting or have previously assisted law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of a crime, or who are likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just to give you an example, in 2017, there were 284 incidences where people applied, and out of the 284, 212 were approved. So that's a significant amount that were approved for for that purpose. And again, we are focused on the fact that individuals are victims.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't care what color, race, religion, affiliation or immigration status. That does not matter to us when we're dealing with victims.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Chief, for the clarifying information. I just want to make sure we're clear on on why it's asked in the context in which it's asked as well, which is actually to, it seems, from what you're saying, to support our immigrant populations for for staying here, in fact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A few more questions. So under in terms of sharing personal information, which was a big one for SB 54 and of course here in Long Beach, not just for the police department, but we want to make sure, as I mentioned before, that sharing personal information, retaining the information, disseminating the information is not it's prohibited not just from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the police department, but from every single department in this city. That means code enforcement officers should not be doing that. That means health department officers should not be doing that. Public works. However, people provide information. It should not be disseminated, shared at all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, Chief, I just have to get clear on this one. Under what circumstances do we, if at any time, share information, do we still have to share it if the information is public? Because I know personal information as well as release dates are an issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that there may be some some. Well, there is a large question about that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. There are definitely questions about that and very good questions. Basically, when we're dealing with arrest information, the majority, if not all of that is already public information. So, for example, when we arrest people within, I want to say 24 hours, maybe just a little bit more, we're actually providing a list through relationships and previous agreements that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we have with the media. So when you're arrested, people say, well, you're not supposed to give that out. Actually, we do give it out, and that's for everybody. It is important to note that because we are tied into the L.A. County booking system, when an individual gets arrested in the city of Long Beach, they get life scanned'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The minute they get life scanned, their information automatically goes into that booking system. ICE has access to that system. So whether we want to share it or not, it is something they have access to. That's important because I think a lot of the people who spoke, I don't think definitely understand, understood that the only exceptions would be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'consistent with SB 54. And I think Councilwoman Pryce talked about that as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. I'm just going to get my notes here. I'm sorry. The next question is transfers to ice. Can you explain whether there are transfers to ice occurring from the Long Beach Police Department?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The simple answer to that would be a quick one. And that would be not to my knowledge, at least during the time I've been the chief of police in this city, in our city, the last three plus years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it is important to note that if ICE wants somebody in our custody, we do have a procedure in place to comply with the current law. And that's very important. And again, going back to the previous question in some of my answer, when ICE automatically gets the booking information they have in their system, when somebody is wanted'",
        "'speaker_0': 'by ICE for one reason or another, it is important for everybody who is listening to me to understand that when ICE wants somebody from the Long Beach Police Department, we do not automatically release people to ICE unless they provide us with a judicial warrant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If they have a civil civil paperwork, that does not work for us. It has to be a judicial warrant and that is per SB, it's actually a before and then SB 54. So we're following state law when it comes to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So a judicial criminal warrant and is is needed on all of these cases. So for specific release date information and also for transfers to ICE as well. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, that is our current practice. And I believe based on what we're doing, we are following state law. SB 54 and 84.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Now a few more questions here. How are we handling criminal immigration reentry? I'm sorry. Just immigration reentry after someone has already been deported when they come back. Is there a specific. Way we are handling our process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are handling these types of individuals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We comply with SB 54. We don't proactively enforce any immigration related offenses. The only way we're going to come in contact with somebody under the circumstances I think you're asking about is if they get rearrested for one reason or another.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then access to jails or ICE agents or federal agents using our Long Beach jails to conduct business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did some research on that because sometimes you ask the question and people say either no or I don't think so. Based on the research we did, I didn't find any instances, at least recently, where somebody from ICE visited our jail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But under if you look at SB 54 or something, I want to make clear to everybody in this room and anybody who's listening is I don't if you are committing violent crimes, serious crimes, or you are impacting this community in a very negative way because you're a repeat offender, I'm going to allow any agency that will assist'",
        "'speaker_0': 'us in making sure that that individual, whether they are documented or undocumented, gets the full force of the law. Because at the end of the day and something I didn't say earlier, I'm people have said it over and over.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm the son of an immigrant, too. I grew up in an immigrant community. I know firsthand what it's like to be victimized by individuals who I'm always looking around saying, boy, somebody needs to do something about these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I live with that I know a lot of you out there, people I've worked with hand in hand, you know who I am. You know where my heart is. We don't go after the ice cream vendor, but I'm going to tell you something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There will be no sanctuary for anybody who's committing serious crime in this city. I don't care what your immigration status is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, Chief, thank you. And the next question I have is in regards to the types of joint task force meetings we have and we've been involved with. And I know we do have an M.O.. You contract with the Port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Perhaps we can talk about maybe what's included in that M.O. you respective to how we can we collaborate on our waterways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have an individual that's assigned to the best task force, which is maritime security, as you know. And we have spoken about this issue on many occasions. We are a very unique city with many homeland security needs. Part of one of our biggest responsibilities we have in this city is maritime security, waterside and and landside.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Part of the task force that we're on. They focus on maritime security type issues which deal with homeland security. There is human trafficking involved. There's narcotics involved and other long term investigations. That is a very important part of keeping this community safe, our homeland safe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we participate with many other law enforcement agencies that include include other federal law enforcement agencies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you very much. And then, Kevin, I just have a couple of questions for you. To 87 G, if you're familiar with that program, if you'd be able to just quickly talk about the 287 G program. It's in essence, I'll just say it real briefly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a federal program in which states can participate in in deputizing their police officers to enforce immigration law similar or in conjunction with ICE. Do you are we saying in this proposal that we will not enter into any new M.O. user contracts with respective under this under this 27 G program?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman Gonzales. The answer to that question is yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Great. And then the last one for you, Kevin, is which city entities outside of our own city departments have we engaged with? And are we asking in this policy to implement similar policies because we want to make sure outside of the city if a student at Cal State, Long Beach, Long Beach, City College, the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'port, the water department, I'm hoping they were all engaged with, and that we can start recommending whatever we pass today to make sure the whole city is included.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez is part of the the process of developing the ordinance. We limited we limited our interaction to city manager departments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we did discuss.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The the need to, to reach out to non city manager departments. And as, as I indicated in the presentation tonight, we would encourage non city departments to, to either comply with whatever, whatever policy the City Council adopts or a similar policy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we have we have, you know, taken an interest in that. We've also engaged with Cal State Long Beach as part of the engagement process. We collected some information on the Long Beach Unified School District and some things that they've been they've recently done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I could I could have Katie come and speak to some of those things that those recent actions that have taken place. But I think for this this particular this particular item that's on the agenda tonight, our efforts are really focused on the city of Long Beach and its departments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I would like Katie to speak to the engagement work that we did and what we found with some of the other agencies in the community and what they're doing to limit cooperation with immigration authorities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Good evening. Yes. Good evening. Sorry. Getting the hang of that. Good evening, counsel. Councilmember Gonzalez in particular. As Kevin mentioned, we did some outreach with Cal State, Long Beach, both with the police department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As well as the Dream Center. And what we learned through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our outreach there is the police department following the incident where a Cal State Long Beach police officer pulled over Jose Alvarez past what they refer to as General Order 55, which is similar in some ways to what we're proposing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the officers shall not stop or detain persons for determining, based on their immigration status or arrest persons solely for alleged undocumented entry into the U.S. and because their law enforcement. Cal State Long Beach Police Department also must follow SB 54.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additionally, what we found in outreaching to Cal State Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is through their dream center, they do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Provide resources for students, including an investment of $200,000 to pay for fees for students. And they work to connect students to resources and help normalize the college experience. We also learned through just some research that Long Beach Unified passed a resolution in February 2015, essentially designating schools as safe zones and ensuring that any request by ICE, either'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for access to schools or for student information, must first go through the superintendent's office. They're not collecting any data with respect to immigration status for their students, and they also partnered with their afterschool providers to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ensure that they're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also abiding by those same policies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Kate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you very much for that. The clarifying information. So I'm going to have I have a motion that I'm going to put on the floor, a couple items that I'm going to put on the on the floor here, just including all this information, because I think, again, a lot of the information that we heard today was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'just not we haven't heard before. And I really appreciate the police department for and Chief Luna for answering these questions, because I think there were a lot of muddy points for many of our residents who didn't really understand what our LBB PD policy was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And before the special order came out and it just states one simple thing, the administrative warrants versus criminal warrants, I think we could possibly add more in the special order respective to what you're mentioning today and the answers you provided.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if that's something we can do, I want to make a motion, my first motion, you know, the special order. And I don't know if you've seen, but the city of Los Angeles created a special order back in the seventies, 1979, when Daryl Gates was the chief of police back a long time ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the special order was because of many raids happening, similar to what we're going through today, lots of raids happening to the L.A. community. The city of L.A. decided they need to do something and take a stand. And so the chief of police at that time put forward a special order, as we did, similar to what we're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'doing now. But it clearly outlined what we can and cannot do in terms of being a police department. So what I would like to to ask Chief Luna and adding in this motion is to include the a mandate, the special order that outlines the procedure not only for civil versus judicial criminal warrants, which you've included, but also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'includes these special cases that we've discussed today. So the questions that I've asked Chief Luna and the answers provided, I would like that to be included. So it's clearly dictated what we can and cannot do as a city Long Beach Police Department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition to that, we do need to make this publicly available. I believe that many other cities have their policies publicly available online. Whether whatever happens today, we still need to educate individuals more than here that need to understand what this policy actually means and what we're going to do going forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'd like us to have a a site, a city website similar to what we did with the land use element. Long Beach dot gov slash Long Beach Values Act that clearly defines maybe facts and questions so people understand in various languages what this means tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thirdly, I'd like to ensure that we provide this resolution as soon as possible to all city departments. I'm sorry to all city entities outside of the departments for recommended implementation as soon as possible. And with that, with our city departments, it would be good if we had a letter of commitment from each of our department heads in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that we make sure that this is protocol from now on, that the Long Beach Values Act is something that each of us are committed to, not just the Long Beach Police Department, but every single city department is committed to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And lastly, I do believe in the legal defense fund. I think many other cities have done it. If you look at the city of New York has $16 million that they they have a lot of money that they privately funded, which is fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have New York City. I'm sorry, I already said New York. It's been a long night. Washington, D.C., $500,000 as little as Santa Anna, $65,000. But I know we can do more here. And so and this is why I'm saying this is because regardless of what happens, I the police department, from what we're gaining and commitment from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our police department in all of our city departments, is that we don't have a crystal ball to see anyone in here or ourselves or anyone who has any criminal background. We don't we don't know who does or does not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we want to be able to protect all of our immigrants, as well as all of the individuals who are high need individuals outside of being an immigrant. Right. We talked about people of color. We talked about people who need to be universally represented.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And much of the funding and various other cities do have universal representation. So that's what I'm going to ask for tonight. I would like to direct the city manager to secure. We've asked originally for 100,000. I am going to ask for $250,000 in general fund dollars perhaps as a baseline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Perhaps we can do more, starting with any surplus from 2017 or any unused moneys from other special funds for the exclusive use of legal defense in response to deportation cases, including individuals who need universal representation. And this should be in conjunction with organizations such as the Vera Institute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that this institute has a longstanding history of working with municipalities. It is an organization that works with us that could work with us, possibly matching funds, so giving us another 250,000. It also provides key performance and metrics, and that's really important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How are we doing in this policy? What? Where do we need? Where are the gaps? Two years, three years, four years down the line and reports for ongoing policy suggestions and how we can continue to report. I will say in that fund, whoever we work with, whether it's whether it's the community foundation or central charge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whoever it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to make sure that impacted communities like the Cambodian refugees do take priority depending on what the public feels. I also feel that if we're going to use this fund as well to look at all of our communities, high risk individuals who have maybe some background that they need to get expunged or need some additional services'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that we're also looking to places like our African-American communities and our Latino communities, whether immigrants are not. So that's what I'm putting out there. The last thing I will say is we need to provide updates on all. I'm sorry, this is another add on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Provide all updates on state and federal policies to the City Council. We've done a really great job at that. There is one bill that we I don't know that we've supported in the past. It's the Senate Bill 1506 that basically states that landlords should not be retaliating against immigrant populations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think we need to take a stand and support that as well. And then the last thing here is there is a initiative that we have not taken a part of. Los Angeles has taken a part of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'San Francisco has taken a part of this, but we have not. So we're missing here. And someone from the Cambodian community spoke to it. The Long Beach YMCA is a partner in this, but we are not as a city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm asking us to be a partner. Welcoming initiate I'm sorry, welcoming America initiative. Becoming a member of this initiative cost as low as $200 annually. We can do things like create certification processes for how well we're doing with inclusivity respective to immigration populations, and it provides additional resources with a mission to provide a roadmap for training'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and in becoming a more inclusive city towards immigrants and really all residents. So I'm asking us to be a member, official member of this initiative. So with that said, I thank you all here for for being here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope that this is a very robust motion for everyone. And I also want to say that the work is not going to be done. It's not going to be done here. And we have a lot of work to go ahead and continue doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But this, I know, is a great starting point to support our immigrant communities. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. I know we have a long speakers list. I'm going to just say a few a few comments and questions and I'll I'll let everybody else cue up. I know we're going to second round now, Jessica, but a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The first is obviously just a a I think that she just amended her main motion is what she did.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a substitute on the floor. This would be a substitute. Substitute. Correct. Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second on the substitute substitute?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, we got a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second on the substitute? Substitute. Okay. All right. So that is the substitute motion on the floor. So a couple a couple a couple questions for the staff and the city attorney. So just the thing I think that's important and I want to make sure and I appreciate everyone's comments and I appreciate whether there will'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be is and where they're coming from. When when I think when we talk about public safety and one of the reasons why I believe that folks advocated and we have had a coalition of folks come together with the sanctuary coalition is because public safety, as we know, is not just about policing, but public safety is also about'",
        "'speaker_0': 'making sure that people in the community feel safe as part of that community. One of the reasons why sanctuary policies are important for all those folks that have also contacted to our office, is that in the current environment, a lot of people in our community just do not feel safe interacting, not just with law enforcement, but also'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with government. And so what we're seeing right now, and I've talked to folks in the police department, I've talked to judges at our courts, I've talked to residents in the community. There is a real fear from people to even interact with the judicial system or the public safety continuum system that we have in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so for for all of us, where it might be very easy and we don't have a problem with picking up the phone or calling 911 or asking for help. I think it's important for everyone to know, and particularly for those that are watching tonight, that that is not the case for everyone in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the fear that people feel with interacting with the government actually makes us less safe. It makes us less safe as a community because crimes and serious issues are not being reported. We have some cases out of the Long Beach courthouse where we've had women in particular.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not show up to some domestic violence cases because of their immigration status and because they're afraid of deportation. So those are real fears. And that's why I believe this council is having this this debate today. The first the first thing is a question I know I had asked the city attorney this, but it's my understanding on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the legal defense fund question, I fully support a legal defense fund. I think that not only should the city have be a part of that, and I think it's important that there are and there is public dollars to a legal defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that says a lot about the city's commitment, but also, of course, that the city would engage like like L.A. or the county has an additional fund raising, a nonprofit support. But Mr. City Attorney, is it your legal opinion that we can develop a legal defense fund, essentially have a system that creates one?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know I have asked you that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor, members of the council, I think the answer is yes. But we couldn't, as the councilmember from the first District described, we couldn't do that tonight. What we would do is take direction from the council, as I'm taking notes here on what it is that you would like to do, how you would like to set it up'",
        "'speaker_5': ', we would need to do additional research, look at what the other cities are, and come back to council for an authorization for the Fund. Who the partners would be to provide council with the information necessary for the defense fund that then they can approve that as a policy decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think at the end of the day, the answer is yes, we can get you where you want to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I just want to make and I want to just add to that as well. And so I think I'm clearly with both the County of Los Angeles and the city of Los Angeles and other jurisdictions establishing legal defense funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach can establish one and we should establish one as well. I do have a question for the chief because I mean, obviously, the main conversation debate is around the carve out piece and those particular sets of crimes that have occurred in the past.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so when when SB 54 obviously was adopted, there was no in the law. I believe there is no set of kind of check and balance about what that meant. It was kind of it was kind of penal as a brush, a kind of an overall crime that was listed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know that it got overly specific or had any types of additional measures to protect undocumented people within local jurisdictions. And so I guess what I'm wondering is within within us here in Long Beach, is it possible that we could develop an additional policy that focuses if if there were going to be a carve out, if'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the carve outs, let's say, in some cases in other jurisdictions, have been abused or could be abuse, could we have a policy that could be developed that would essentially create either either oversight or checks and balances or triggers within within our policy or law?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In order to afford for the police department to actually at that point with those types of crimes, interact with the federal government. Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council. A policy can can be developed. It can include supervisory or management oversight of anything that would come forward and be approved at the at higher levels within the police'",
        "'speaker_0': 'department. Okay. So what you're saying that if there is a that there could be a there could be a additional level of approval if there was going to be a a transfer that was going to take place, that it just wouldn't be automatic, but there could actually be a different level of protection or there could be a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'policy created that we could have to have some kind of approval at the highest level for that to occur. Yes. The only thing I would ask is to confer with the city attorney, make sure we're looking at SB 54 to make sure that that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But based on the way you're describing it, it seems completely plausible to be able to do that. Okay. And I just want to just throw that out again, as I think there regardless of where and there's a lot of folks that are keyed up to speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm not sure exactly where this will this will end tonight. But I just want to make sure, as we keep going, that we look at ways of strengthening beyond what we have with SB 54, that the mandate because I believe there are still additional ways that we can strengthen the law and create additional protections for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'undocumented members. So I think that would be one way. I think there are many opportunities beyond that that would be able to, I think, make make good beyond just be 54 and make a little bit stronger for us here locally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me keep going on on the speakers list, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you and thank you to my colleagues and Mayor and Chief Luna. Typically, I would have talking points right now, but this is definitely it did not see where the night was going. I want to first say how much again, it means to me that you guys came out that not only did we have residents that we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'see come out to a lot of these issues like Claudia's law, but that we had clergy in full force and more importantly, that we had the opportunity to hear from from attorneys, some attorneys that have taken a look at this and written, you know, I've got the letter from ACLU in front of me that's very easy to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'digest and a lot of points around what legally we can do as a city. And I think that coming up to tonight, there are a lot of questions. What we're hearing from PD on what is practice, where there's transparency and actual policy, where we get to see a policy that says this is what we actually do versus'",
        "'speaker_2': ', you know, the situations are different. Every single situation is different whenever we have somebody in a community. And I remember in my first year in office getting the calls early in the morning about the Cambodians that were facing deportation and hiding out families that have lived here, hiding out in fear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And while that wasn't a situation where it looked like PD had somebody in custody and then communicated with ICE, it seemed to folks that there was some collaboration. And so I think that that's the message we need to make sure that we send tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do not support the carve outs. I know that there are. I know that my my colleagues are listening to the discussion or digesting a lot of the information that you guys provided to us. And again, having legal letters in front of us definitely helps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I know that it seems like there's some movement on that, and I know that there's a very easy way for us to have that conversation. But there's already substitute motions and subsub motions. So what I'd like to ask a couple of questions just to get us coming from some of these letters and making sure, again'",
        "'speaker_2': ', that we're having a transparent conversation. One of the questions that was brought up was that agencies allow in-custody transfers of office. And I know, Chief Luna, you already made mention that since you've been in your position that you don't have record of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But is that in fact a policy not to collaborate? And I know some of this is going to you're going to hear it twice, just a little bit. I just want to make sure that we're getting the answers correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you understand that question? Sorry. I wanted to conversation afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Pryce or Pierce. I think I understood the question. And the answer to that is we follow SB 54 when it comes to the transfer of and a before before that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so following that means that if there are exemptions, there are certain situations like federal crimes crimes in 15 years and that those those carve outs. Right. Are those exemptions, I should say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With SB 54, and I don't have it in front of me, but there is a clause in there that if you get rearrested and you had committed, I believe it's a felony in the last 15 years that SB 54 states that yeah, you can absolutely get deported.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So what I have in front of me is that if it's a conviction for a serious or violent felony conviction for a felony that's punishable by imprisonment conviction within the last 15 years or any other specific. Yeah, well, I'm looking at some of the top ones that are that people have talked to me about recently and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a conviction that's occurred in the last five years of a misdemeanor. So these are all opportunities that ICE would be able to come in and work with PD to to remove somebody. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I'm sorry. With the list of crimes like assault, battery use of threats, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of a child, burglary, robbery, all those things are listed under there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's within 15 years. And so that as we move forward, I'm not going to be able to to vote yes on something tonight that still leaves those in there. If there's a move from the council to continue having this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm open and I want to say that I you know, I'm a mother. I'm somebody that has been a victim of violent crimes. I have a five year old daughter. I do not want to provide an opportunity for more violent crimes to happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think it was said by, you know, one of my colleagues and also attorneys that we're here tonight. Immigration status has nothing to do with the crime that was committed and that we have seen people be rehabilitated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've seen people be rehabilitated. We've seen change that has been able to happen. And so how are we as a society talking about rehabilitation and second chances? And I know it's something that another one of my colleagues cares deeply about our our prosecutor cares deeply about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so what I'm interested in is that there's a conversation around instead of 15 years, that there's a small maybe there's not exactly what everybody in the room wants, but maybe it's five years. Is there a conversation that we can have here that brings us a Long Beach policy as a starting point, and that we can continue'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to have this conversation about what other items we have in here or don't have in here. And so I'm probably going to queue up again, but I want to hear what my colleagues are. And again, the carve outs are not something that I support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really appreciate all the efforts that my Councilmember Lena Gonzalez, have put in here. And I really support all of those and continuing to make sure that we're transparent, that we're working with PD on those conversations, but curious to hear what my colleagues are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Counts membership or not? Thank you. My topic was going to be the justice fund, but it was somewhat defined yesterday and certainly earlier this evening. But now it's become somewhat amorphous. So I'm not sure if this will make any sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But my original objection to the way the fund funding mechanism was structured was, I understand why we didn't want to be part of the Los Angeles Justice Fund. We don't want to be a small fish in a big pond, so we come up with a legal defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my point was just continue that philosophy right down to the council office level. So for instance, for public works, we have something called divide by nine funds. So I just wanted to get my fair share for the folks in need in my district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I met with the. City manager and deputy city manager yesterday. And they said, well, is it possible under this system? And that's that's a tough one for me. I guess the worst scenario for me would be to have a constituent in need and say, well, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think the money's in the fund, but I don't control it anyway. I hated a system that would potentially lead up to that. So I think we also have a discussion. Well, I don't know where that's going to go, but because the funding mechanism has been questioned tonight, I'll leave that one alone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, I found it interesting because we're talking about Cal State, Long Beach in terms of jurisdictional issues and the fourth District borders, Cal State, Long Beach. So we have that. But I think I count four other agencies that border my district alone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our northern border is a four or five freeway. So that's the California Highway Patrol. I border Orange County. So that can be the Orange County sheriffs or Los Alamitos Police. Then I have a long border with the Signal Hill Police Department, and ironically, there's a large Cambodian population within the city of Signal Hill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that speaks to the fact that these issues are more regional, are our state in nature, because it's tough to have all these different jurisdictions. I think that's all I have to say for now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vice Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And this has gotten to be a very, very complex conversation. I'm actually really enjoying enjoying this conversation. So, first of all, just thanks to everyone here who's given their stories, particularly, you know, I want to shout out Hilda, my ninth district resident here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hilda is one of the most active leaders in North Long Beach. And, you know, from the Lions Club to the neighborhood associations to the healthy eating, active living hill zone. And thank you for stepping up and telling your story.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think you you nailed it for me in terms of the value that that folks, you know, that are undocumented or have a history of being different, immigration status, their contributions to our community. So thank you. And and Councilwoman Pryce, thank you for sharing your story as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that was really that was really interesting to hear hear your perspective, hear your story. That helps to help me understand where everyone is. I would say under normal circumstances and in normal times, we would encourage our local government to coordinate with other agencies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In normal times, these are not normal times. You know, frankly, these are not these are not normal times. And we have to protect the institution of government, the faith that folks have in the institution of government for a number of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And a lot of them have been articulated. So I won't I won't repeat them. But we've seen when when states and cities have or have not done the right thing and the federal government has had to step in and help enforce state cities and states to do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I see this as sort of an inverse of that. And what I'm talking about is sort of the end of segregation, a number of things that were happening in the South. Many people don't know this, but I moved here from Alabama, from from the south.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, we do have a history of understanding the difference. And when the federal government, state government and local government are on the same page, and I think we're just in one of those moments right now that we have to be very clear about the experience that we want our residents to have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so just to be very clear, I support this policy. I support this policy. I want to be very clear that, you know, I didn't like you know, I want to better understand this situation and carve outs because the reason I signed on to this to begin with wasn't to create loopholes or wasn't to create opportunities to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'game the system. The opportunity. What we wanted to do was protect citizens and have confidence for all of our citizens to make sure that they they have confidence in their government. So I want to understand this a little bit more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just going to ask just a just a couple questions, Chief. Just walk me through just walk me through my understanding my understanding what went through what happens under two scenarios. One, someone gets stopped for non felony local issue that's under sort of our responsibility and our local prosecutors responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's say it's a like a misdemeanor type citation or a citation, something like that. What happens from the moment an officer detains someone? Can you walk me through from that point from particularly from sort of information sharing with with ICE position?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, Vice Mayor Richardson Members of the City Council, if I understood your question correctly for for a misdemeanor citation, the officer would make contact, determine that a misdemeanor crime occurred and then probably run the subject either on the radio or in their computer to see if they have any outstanding warrants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if they determine that they can be cited out and not taken into physical custody and to the station, they issue the citation. The citation has information on there that has to be filled out. The subject then signs a citation, they're released and the citation gets turned in to the station where it eventually makes its way through'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the to the court system. And then they're held they show up in court to answer to the charges if they are, in fact, factual or not. Basically, that's what happens from an information sharing perspective. If we're specifically talking about ice, it goes into our system and I'm trying to think really hard in regards to ice, getting that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'type of information because the person's not actually being booked into the L.A. County system. So their name doesn't pop up because if, for example, we change that hypothetical around and the individual actually gets taken to the booking facility, they do get life scanned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's where the that life scan portion is, where it goes into the county booking system. And then that does become available to ICE. And I'll stop right there because you probably have some questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So at the live scan, so someone's getting booked, they get a live scan and that becomes public to all law enforcement agencies, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. You're you're you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Forcibly send this information to ICE?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not send the information to ICE. The the life scan goes into the L.A. County booking system and becomes available to other law enforcement agencies. ICE is one of many tours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so from there, let's say that this this person, we haven't checked their documentation status. We just do a live scan on everyone. And then let's say ICE reaches out and says, hey, we want this guy. What is the protocol there?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So sorry about that. So we don't check documentation status at the Long Beach Police Department. That is not something that we check. We check criminal history. That's what we're interested in, but we're not interested in in legal status.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, what would happen in the in the case that we're I'm giving you an example of ice. If they are interested in somebody, they would send us an immigration detainer notice of action. And it's basically a form that they would send to us telling us that they're interested.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's signed by an ICE agent. At that time, we determine one, does the individual that they're looking at even meet the criteria that we've been talking about for the last hour? Do they meet that criminal criteria? If they do, then we inform ICE that if they want this individual, they have to provide a court order in order'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to retrieve this individual. That's what I talked about earlier, that in my last three and a half years, I have we have not seen one court order that was presented to us where we turned somebody over.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So at that point, so you've live scanned them. Ice reaches out and says, we're interested in this individual. Then they have to produce a formal request from their agency. We don't act on that request. We push back and say, you have it has to come from the court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It has to be a a court action, a court order to respond. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have additional requirements. And if they meet them, then that happens. And if they don't, they don't get them. And they haven't gotten anybody in at least the three the last three and a half years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And here's where I'm unclear. And Mr. City attorney under was in front of us tonight. Will that step change at all? Because, you know, what I'm hearing is that we do not provide the information unless there's a court order under the motion, under the law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And these values act, no matter what the crime is carved out, not carved out. Does that process change at that point?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I think what you just said at the very end would change it. But if we are currently in compliance with SB 54 and we would remain in compliance with SB 54 tonight. So so the answer would be no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The process would not change if it's current. So we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Don't give. We don't we don't turn anyone over to ice unless there's a court order and there haven't been court orders.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's that is one way. Yes. That with a court order, we would we would turn the individual over to ICE. And we have not received a court order that I'm aware of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do we have the legal ability to say if there's a court order from a court that we don't turn them over?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, we would be in contempt of the court order.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So from a legal standpoint, there's no way once the courts get involved, you have to local cities have to comply.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So at this point, we haven't I'm trying to figure out where the carve out exists, because right now, whether it's a you know, someone that's in that kind of carve out category or not, the question is if the court or some if the courts require us to take action, we don't have any I mean, we don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we don't have a choice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I think one of the distinctions would be with with the exceptions under SB 54. Law enforcement has discretion. If you remove that discretion from them by a policy, then they couldn't do some of these enumerated things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm still. Mr. Chief, could you clarify that a little bit more?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Sorry about that. Yes. So what I have explained to you is the way our process works. SB 54. Allows us to look at a certain set of circumstances, and I could read those to you if you'd like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And based on those circumstances, we can turn somebody over to ICE.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And are all those circumstances federal like felony level circumstances? I'm going to look.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For my piece of paper. And I'll read one portion of it. But it's never healthy to read one piece because you got to get the whole picture of it. Says The individual has been convicted within the past five years of a misdemeanor for a crime that is punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony for or has'",
        "'speaker_0': 'been convicted within the last 15 years of a felony for any of the following offenses. And that's the one that I started to list. There are some very serious, significant crimes on this list. And as you are trying to look at this policy and evaluate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's very dangerous for us to limit what your police department can do. The tools you have, you are taking tools away from us in a toolbox when we're trying to deal with crime. And I'm not suggesting that crime is only committed by undocumented immigrants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's it's it's all across the board. I. I'm going to leave it at that. And you ask more questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Listen, I. I mean, what is what I like, what I heard tonight that I like is that we should be treating everyone the same one way or the other document if they commit. I mean, but that age court cut, that sort cuts both ways.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, frankly and Councilwoman Price said it, if, you know, if someone committed the crime and they did it, we should treat it a certain way. I think the question is how we treat it. And if it's a felony, I and as I understand it, we don't even prosecute felonies in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do misdemeanors to a prosecutor and the D.A. handles felonies. That correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So how does that translate when I'm under I'm not a prosecutor. I don't understand this piece. But what happens from how what does the transition from, say, our shop to the D.A. shop? How does that work? Like if let's say let's say it is a felony.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. And this is something that we know our prosecutors are going to handle. It's a big deal. Crime probably falls in a list. How does how does it end up in your shop, Mr. Chief? To the prosecutor shop.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How does that happen?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what happens in the field is that a police officer will take a crime report or a department record that depending on the crime. So if you're dealing, for example, with assault, sexual abuse or child abuse or robbery, those crime or I'm sorry, those reports will go to the individual detective detail that handles those crimes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Once they evaluate it to make sure the elements of the crime are there, they may have to do further investigation at that. At the point that case is ready to be presented, they decide again, based on the elements, is it going to go be presented to the district attorney's office here in Long Beach, or is it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'going to be presented to the city prosecutor here in Long Beach? If hypothetically, we go to the district attorney's office and they don't feel the elements are there, they will either decline the case or refer it to the city prosecutor because they may believe that a lesser crime may have occurred.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, it does. That really illuminates things for me. So I think the issue here, you know, I mean, signs and politics aside, I just think I just think the issue here is sort of we already if it's a significant crime, we already know we're not going to be the ones to handle that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's going to be the county. And there's a process in place for that. And I think anybody who commits a crime should be punished or, you know, this should be handled right. I mean, we should address crime in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the issue is at what point we hand them over to ICE. And I think with the council saying, I think what the public is saying and what I what I think we should where should we should try to get to, frankly, in all the motions we're taking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can't make another motion here. I think we try to get to is we evaluate if there's just simply away. If they meet this criteria, it goes directly to the D.A. to try to treat them the way you would treat anyone, regardless of documentation status, that we just treat sort of anyone who commits a crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Documents, as, you know, blind to documentation status, we treat them the same. And I don't know I don't know if that's something that city council can just. I don't know if that's something we could figure out, like on the dias, like wing it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think I think that's, in my opinion, that's kind of where we should be talking about. And I don't know if there's an easy way to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, if I understand what you're saying is, please remember that within the SB 54 and what we're talking about, if this wasn't clear in the previous, is you've got an individual with a past record. Yeah. In order to go with SB 54, they have to be re-arrested for something else that they've done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now. They're at the end of the day though. Yeah. That carve out says convicted of not arrested for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have to be convicted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of the crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the set the first offense or that second when you stop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Them for the second, first and second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if the second crime is a murder or something like that, that's listed in this group. So if someone committed the crime, let's say you committed something, you did serve their time, whatever you got out, and then you do a lesser offense on the second incident.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's not a felony, just a traffic stop. Right. And you end up getting live scanned on that traffic stop. Do we would we under under this law because of their past, would we have to comply with ICE?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not for a traffic stop. But if you were you committed murder and you did your time and then you go out and commit another crime, say you commit sexual abuse. That is one of the crimes listed on this list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you get convicted of that sexual abuse, then that's when SB 54 kicks in and you get deported.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that wouldn't be that wouldn't be us. That would be the district attorney. The court conviction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would be through the district attorney's office.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think I think we're at a point I mean, if you just said that, we wouldn't be actionable on that anyway because we'll be the D.A.. Right. Because if it's a conviction on one of those laws, those are all the laws, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the conviction would have to come through the at least in our case, the L.A. County District Attorney's Office.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm going to look just this way, because I'm not in a position to make a motion. But what I'm hearing right here is that what I'm hearing right here is that, frankly, it wouldn't happen in our shop because it would happen when it got to the next step.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe I don't want to give up the floor, but I would like like some like clarity from from Lina and from from Suzy because it seems like it seems like there's not much of a difference from a procedural standpoint here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am. I am I am I here now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So. So if I can just attempt to. I understand what you're asking him. And the SB.'",
        "'speaker_2': '54.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Designed to prevent local law enforcement from sharing immigration information with federal immigration authorities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if there's a category.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of enumerated crimes, then they have the discretion to. Not that they will, but they have the discretion to share that information. It doesn't matter how the case gets prosecuted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or if the case.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Gets prosecuted. SB 54 is designed to prevent local law enforcement from communicating with federal immigration authorities. So what happens is, if you're a prosecutor and I know there's at least a couple of attorneys in the audience who who can attest to this, but if you're a prosecutor, you're going to get a police agency if if federal immigration'",
        "'speaker_7': 'authorities find out that someone has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A is is is here illegally.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then they will put an ice hold on the individual, which means if they get arrested, there is an ice hold on there. If they know of the federal authorities know that the person's illegal. They'll have haven't they'll put an ice hold on them so that they cannot be released without going to ice.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. It doesn't matter if it goes to the prosecution office or not or if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They can be released.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They can't be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Released if there's an ice hold. That's what an ice hold means, is that they can't be free. They can't just walk out of the jail. They have to be released to the custody of federal immigration authorities because there's a federal immigration hold on there basically for the days that would show up on the rap sheet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would say ice holder would show up on our file. Basically, we know that's the only way we would know if someone is there, their citizenship status. But. SB 54 it doesn't matter if it's at the local H police agency level, at the DA's office, at the city prosecutor's office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It doesn't matter because it's about information sharing and how that information gets to federal immigration authorities. So I got what you were trying to say, but actually that information can come before the item goes to and I might be wrong on some of this, but am I wrong on some of this?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe before you guys jump.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jump in. I think the point here is that I think there is more to this conversation about. The car was I want to better understand it and I'd like to give direction to city attorney, to the police chief to figure out how to get it done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what I mean is like, in a way that because there's there's and correct me if I'm wrong, but I like to, you know, sort of preserve the rights of workers as well. But is this is there anything related to this that might trigger any type of meat and confer process?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The answer is yes, depending on what you direct to do. If if you are eliminating the exceptions or the carve outs, then you are. We are back to meeting confer with the unions because you've changed the conditions working condition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think there is a step in this direction we can get to that respects the parties at the table. I haven't heard anybody here say that we want criminals to to go free. I think what I've heard is I've heard people say, frankly, we don't want to be in a position to directly sort of participate in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'deportation actions. Right. But that doesn't mean we want to stop a step in prosecution for someone who's committed a heinous crime in our community. I think there's a difference there. So what I'm saying is I think I think, you know, Lina's motion and I think she's cued up is going to say some more stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to hear more. I'd love to see them work that out. So I want to just, like, stick a pin in that for now and go to because this I think there's something there. I want to go to the the fund part.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. So I know that cities do establish funds and charities non-profits thing like our health department has Long Beach cares and they do a lot of work that, you know, they can't do within the city, you know? You know, you've got partners of parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You've got other things. So I think there is a way to do a fund and I support a fund. And if we're able to figure it out in our budget to use public resources to do it legally, then I want to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we should make that statement. I support that. We did hear today, though we did hear today, though, that the city attorney said he that the step is they have to come back to with we have to give clear direction and come back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just going to ask Councilwoman Gonzalez, because I'm supporting your motion. I'm going to ask, are you okay with sort of adding that city attorney gets the word, you know, city attorney, city manager gets to vet that out and bring it so we can actually establish it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can that out the what is it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So separate out the the fund. So city attorney says we have to. And city attorney correct me but didn't you just say for us to move forward with that? It wouldn't you couldn't actually do it. Tonight was just the direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is correct. The the action tonight and the agenda item tonight doesn't allow you to actually establish the defense fund. We don't have enough details and information in front of you this evening for the council to take an action on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We would need to come back to you with how is the fund going to be established? Who's our partner going to be selective, all of those details so that the council then can decide whether they like that proposal, want to amend or change that proposal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this evening, you could certainly give direction to staff and to my office to investigate that defense fund. And you had mentioned in your motion a 250,000 in the staff report. It talked about 100,000, whatever dollar amount you wanted us to look at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then it would come back to the city council for a vote to establish that fund that the dollar amount you determine to be appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So like separate so we can put the fund on one track and the sanctuary policy on a different track.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure, we can do that. I'd like to hear from colleagues, but absolutely I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those are my comments. Thank you, everybody. I think this is I think it's a healthy conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I learned a lot here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think in general, like the reason we proposed this was to keep people safe and to not coordinate with with with ice. And thank you to the community for helping us better understand this issue. I didn't hear understand anything about carve outs until about 48 hours ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you community organizers keep up the good work in informing you're speaking power to leadership and and we understand you. We hear you. But thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, so I'd like to hear from the city attorney, because I think maybe Vice Mayor Richardson and I were talking about very different things. I know there's some correction that needs to be made in terms of the procedure of SB 54.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if the city attorney could clarify that, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think on a couple of things, I think the chief was indicating that you needed a conviction on the second arresting offense. And the way I read and interpret 54, that's not correct. If the person is arrested and put into the system, then with these carve outs, there could be the cooperation if there are these enumerated'",
        "'speaker_5': 'crimes, as everyone's been discussing. So that was the first issue. The second issue was that you brought up was the ice hold prevents the release. That is my understanding. It is not correct and is not how it's handled, at least in Long Beach, in that if ICE does notify us of an administrative hold on that person, we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'tell them you need to get a judicial warrant for us to hold the individual. We are not going to hold them past the release date. And that's very clear. I think the law is very clear on that. And so we do not there is not a hold put on a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Person because I said there's an ice hold. So that was, I think. Yes, statement. Yes. So those are the two items. And then if you had another question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, so what I'm talking about is an ice hold. That is a judicial determination that there's an ice hold that appears on their rap sheet or other place because it's been judicially identified as a hold so that the person, the custodial entity, whether it be the L.A. County Sheriff Sheriff's Office or whatever county sheriff's office they can't'",
        "'speaker_7': 'release if there's been a judicial order to hold the individual. Okay. So so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Without.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What I'd like to do is, is, is, is make a friendly motion because I think there is definitely and the record should be very clear on this. Definitely some agreement here that we want to protect information sharing, that we want to protect people from being able to talk to the police.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We want to encourage that. So what I'd like to do is make a friendly to remove the funding for a legal defense fund from the current motion to bifurcate it and have that be a second motion that we can vote on in regards to what happens with the funding of a legal defense fund, because I know for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'me, I support and will will actually work to do whatever I can to help put money into that legal defense fund. But I think for the city, given the fact that we're talking about deficits in 2019 and we just had a meeting two weeks ago where we talked about some best case scenario assumptions that would allow us'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to not have to lay off employees. Every single dollar is going to mean something and every one of our departments is going to be competing for money right now. And even though 100,000 or $250,000 may not seem like a lot of money, I can tell you our police department, our fire department, our Parks and Rec and our'",
        "'speaker_7': 'public works and our libraries could find something to do with that $250,000. So we're going to be competing for funds. So what I would like to do is separate and bifurcate the funding option so that we can, you know, maybe evaluate that in another time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's my friendly to my colleague.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good council member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'GONZALEZ Yes. Given the discussions going on today, I think as you can see, a lot of us are, you know, going back and forth, but it's with good reason. We want to make sure we get this right. And so with that, absolutely, I'll accept your friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Mongo. We're going to keep going through the speakers. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, here we are. I would just like to say that. To get clarity of the motion on the floor. It's to enumerate the policies. Would you outline.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If I if I may, as has just amended, we've divided the question. And so the motion is to adopt staff's recommendation, including the special order as described between the chief and the council member from the First District to make that special order public, to make the resolution, if adopted, available to all the city departments and encourage their'",
        "'speaker_5': 'adoption. Six five to provide regular updates to the City Council on the legislative efforts at the state and federal level. And six, to join the Welcome America America Initiative. And then the Legal Defense Fund would be separated out of that question and a separate motion and action would be taken on the legal defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I'll also say that in law enforcement, I have felt that it is so important that the community are our eyes and ears. There are never going to be enough police officers to keep everyone safe. And that more often the victims of crime are actually immigrants.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That is $250,000. It took four years to build a program that we know is universally used and supported. And when we do have to make those tough choices, I believe that those decisions should be done through a budget process.'",

And why is it that we know when we're talking about this issue here, we're talking about, you know, Latinos or people of color with an issue with their immigration status and that we have to report that out and we have to to turn them over to ICE and to immigration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, people of color. I disagree with that. I have I have issues with a car, but I really do because some of the crime boats that are here, some of the crimes, I don't see them reaching that level of having to be deported.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I was there. I supported SB 54 when it came to us, what, a year and a half, two years ago, I supported putting it there and I supported Citrulline, which being part of the number of cities that supported it because I thought it was it's a good it's a good policy to have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But now that we're here with our Own Values Act, we have to talk about our values and what we stand for in Long Beach. You know, we're always talking about the Long Beach way and how we do things differently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we need to look at those carve outs in a different way, in a way that it's much more justifiable for those that get who are in danger of being deported because of their their status, legal status here or not and because of the level krone did.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Within the ten years, it's like it goes away and you start fresh again. Why can we do something like that? What's some of these other ones? Like fraud or or embezzlement? Now, there are some crimes because of the nature of their their seriousness that maybe that we do need to to look at those more seriously and consider'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Crime, maybe you should be kicked.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Out of this country. But again, it's we're looking at possibilities of of deporting someone that you did it the first time for first time or so we do we have a3a3 strikes law on deportations. I don't think we do it when we're in your pocket once and ice comes and says it, put a hold on you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're out, you're gone. It doesn't matter. So anyway, I have no issue with that. With the carve outs, I'm not going to be voting for that only because, like I say, it's it's it's it's a slippery slope. I really don't really agree with it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we could do better. 15 years is an extremely long time. We should look at modifying it in terms of maybe having it strengthen it. And we were talking earlier about strengthening some of these things, and I think that would be going a long way in strengthening the carve outs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As far as a legal defense fund, I'm totally in favor of it and I'm glad that we're separating that out because that's a to me, that's a separate issue regarding to in terms of the carve outs and and establishing a defense fund.'",

This is our second conversation where we're really, as the vice mayor mentioned, having the discussion around what carve outs mean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we heard from you guys, no carve outs, but I still don't feel like we've had a transparent conversation with PD, with our city attorney and with our counsel. That really means that we all understand all of those components.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I, I feel like we're not really prepared to have that up or down vote on the carve outs or not. And so I want to make sure that we all have the opportunity to have that in a transparent, open way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to ask if we could have the vote today on both the items and then direct the staff to come back and do a presentation from PD on clear on what all those items are that are carved out, particularly in sections three, B, four D, four F in 4G.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm not going to go back and read them all because it's already late. But if we could come back and have a conversation where all the councilmembers and myself included, feel like we're having a thoughtful discussion and vote on those carve outs, that today we move forward with what we have.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I look forward to that thorough discussion. So with the coming back from staff, coming back with the police chief to have a thorough discussion around all the carve outs, I will be voting yes for this. Does that make sense?'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Andrews? Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I think everyone up there I've had a chance to listen to everyone, you know, conversations about what they think they should and should not be.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you again. Okay. Thank you. And then our last last speaker is Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So we're going to tie this up together. And I just, again, want to thank you all. I don't want to, you know, go on too too long. But it looks like we have something on our plates here.'",

I mean, you're having a continued conversation, but the action this evening will keep the in Long Beach Values Act as adopted by council if it passes this evening would have that language in it.

        "'speaker_0': 'Is the grant going to address that or is that moving on a separate track?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a separate track. However, we do have the Emmylou finalized and the clinician will be in the jail. Jail effective April 2nd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, that's great news. So, so so this you're talking like in a month?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, in less than a month. And it is.'",

I think that's going to be a very, very important move in the right direction at the jail and certainly to ensure that we're providing the right services for folks that need help, particularly those that are that are'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I'm sorry you're on, Mr. Mayor. And I was thinking about court. I was. I did want to acknowledge the I-Team because they came and did a presentation at Public Safety Committee, and it was a fantastic presentation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've been using the information from the presentation as talking points at all my community meetings. I would like to let you know that I think probably after six months of having the clinician in jail in the jails, we'd love to get a report back on some of the data and how many people were routed into services and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'what types of services and all of that. So I'm sure you have some data tracking in place, but if not, I think we'll be looking for that information about six months out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'd be happy to provide that update. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And I really haven't had a chance to review this given the issues that we did last week with the QE and given that a lot of our audience is gone and probably gone from the TV as well. I think that we should give this a more focused attention, and I think we could do that in the next'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me. My daughter will speak better than I can. Hello. Council and mayor. My name is Jennifer Chadwick. I also live by 939 Pacific Avenue. Recently, my mom and I have got a 60 day notice. Our management company has bought our building and is forcing us all out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My mom is disabled and on a fixed income and I have done a lot for the community, including volunteering at the Aquarium of the Pacific, doing beach cleanups and a lot of other things. For years I've supported Long Beach, but right now I'm really hoping that the City of Long Beach can support me as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to ask the council and mayor to help support and protect the renters on beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much. Our next speaker, please. Good evening, council and mayor. My name's John Russo. I'm also speaking of the terms of rent control. We need rent control in Long Beach. Apparently, it's been looked over for many years. Different cities have rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Los Angeles has rent control. And I do believe Los Angeles is L.A. County, which I do believe Long Beach is L.A. County. Now, I don't understand that. But anyway, I've lived at this apartment complex for three years. The first year, I wasn't even there a whole year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They wanted to raise my rent. I send them a letter saying, Hey, have you been here a year? You want to raise my rent? Second year they raise my rent 700 and some dollars a year. Okay. This year went up to $100 and it wasn't even 60 day notice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was a 30 day notice. I called fair housing and they just like, oh, well, they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, how much they ever want. And there's nothing. In other words, we have no rights as renters, which, like I say, matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not fair. I mean, from what you know, there's got to be something done. You know, we're trying to get maybe a rent freeze or something and to to compensate us. But, you know, $100 a month is like 14%, you know, and and it's it's insane.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the building I live in is built in 1946. And a lot of things have been going wrong. And a lot of people are are afraid to ask to get things fixed because boom, they can buda sound at any time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a notice thing. They can throw anybody out at any time, whenever they want without any given notice. I mean, you could pay your rent on time for 20 years and next thing you know, we're booting you out because we want to we want to raise the rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We want to re rent your place and we want to raise it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Councilwoman, did you want to speak after the speakers or. I know you're kidding. After the speakers are now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Addressed, I think the mother and up there they are upstairs. And I know Rajan in my office has been in contact with you and I know it's beachfront property management is your. So we're in the process of connecting with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just want to let you know and Corey and my office will be out here to just make sure and we solidify that we're following up. Okay. Thank you so much for being here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And did you want to speak now?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Councilmember Pearce and I also wanted to ask you guys to reach out to Long Beach Cop. We just created a new fund with them on assisting people transitioning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it's another.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good resource that you might not know is available yet because we haven't publicized it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But thank you, Councilmember. And next week, please, Josh Butler, executive director for Housing Long Beach. I'm also a resident of the third district. And with regards to whether or not this item should be delayed further, I can't say that it's any surprise given the lack of urgency that affordable housing has received in this city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have I was part of a study group to prepare recommendations to bring them forward. It's been almost a year since we put those recommendations forward. We are hoping to hear tonight about the progress that we have made in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The sense of urgency is missing from this body. The people that are here are smaller numbers compared to the people that are coming to see us for housing. Long Beach, whose entire buildings are being sold, they're being thrown out with nothing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The owners of the building are making money. The people who are purchasing the building are going to make money. But these residents, they hurt and they lose. And so delaying this for them delays a conversation about how we get to solving some of their problems.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we would like to have that conversation sooner than later. It's very disappointing to read in the initial report that did come out this afternoon that inclusionary housing looks like it's that we're still a year away from seeing that even come to the light of day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would be about almost two years from the time that the recommendations were made to this body. It'll be almost three years from the time that we initially had the conversation about inclusionary housing in this city. Meanwhile, 5000 units of housing have been built in the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Only 3% of those units are affordable. And of those 3%, 97% of them are spoken for, for seniors, veterans. And then the rest are set at 80%. Am I? So there's literally no affordable housing being built in the downtown area?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. We're going to wait longer to have this conversation. It really we can wait because there isn't a whole lot to say. We're still not meeting the mark. We're still not getting there. And I am glad that next week we will be having a conversation about the rent control ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It seems like that's the only way to get anybody's attention around here on this issue, is that people got to do it themselves because we're getting no support here. We don't want funding is great for people to get dollars to help them pay for an application fee or for a rental deposit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we would prefer them to not have to move in the first place. There's nowhere for them to go right now. That's the problem. I know it's late to you all here. This is a wait to me because I was here just as late at Housing Long Beach last night with an office full of people who are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'being kicked out of their units. We're hoping to come here tonight to get some answers, only to be told that we have to come back for that. And so I guess we will be back. But I guess the first priority will be to have a conversation that's being brought up by districts three, four and five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The east side of the city, which is the homeowner dominant part of the city, is going to have a conversation next week and start to dictate to the rest of the city, to the 60% of the people that rant about what we should and shouldn't have, what policies we should and shouldn't have, and what are going to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'affect us and not affect us. So I think the priorities here are just getting a little bit out of whack and we'd like to figure out how we can bring them back into the mainframe. Thank you, Mr. Butler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mayor. Before I do the next speaker, make the maker of the motion wants to speak.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think, given the fact that there are people here who are interested in this item, I figured that we wanted to have a more robust conversation on this. But certainly, if they're ready to move forward, I would withdraw my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So so we want to have now we're going to have the presentation. Okay. So what we're going to do is we're going to go back to public comment in a minute. We're going to but we're first going to we're going to do the presentation and then you'll be the first one for public comment if there's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'no objection. Okay. So we are going to do we will do the presentation counts. From your accounts. We recognize requests. There's an emotion. There's emotion. Second, I believe, to receive it far this presentation. So why don't we start and please staff do the full presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And Mr. West or Mr. McEwan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council. I'll be turn this over to staff to go through the the PowerPoint presentation. But where we all started with this was back in May 2nd, 2017. This Council received and filed a very extensive report on revenue tools and incentives for the production of affordable housing and really adopted a very'",
        "'speaker_5': 'robust workplan for staff to follow on affordable housing. So there were 29 different recommendations that are really designed to encourage and increase the production of affordable housing. We prevent provided a number of written updates on those recommendations. Throughout the last several months, we've made great progress on some.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some were still going on and some were still working on. And this is in response to a request on January 16th to give us a formal progress report. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick Geary, our housing officer or housing bureau manager, to go through the report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Tom. We seem to be missing our clicker. I don't know if it's around here somewhere. Thank you. Just as a reminder, the 29 policies that were adopted in May are broken down into three categories policies to implement immediately existing initiatives and process and new initiatives for development and implementation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm just going to run through them in order. Excuse me. Starting with 1.1, which is to encourage housing preservation. This is ongoing. Since 2014, 1376 at risk units have been preserved in fiscal year 17. We worked on Beechwood Apartments, which you can see here on the slide, a photo of the existing building on the left and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a rendering of the new building on the right. This is currently under construction. And then we just are wrapping up the preservation of Sara's apartments, which is 29 units at 240 West Seventh Street. Unfortunately, I don't have a picture of that project, but that one is also underway.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then one point, too, is to encourage the use of project based vouchers. This is also ongoing and we've been partnering with the Housing Authority quite a bit lately with the beacon that's currently under construction. There's 160 units in the project and 158 project based vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then with the spark at Midtown, that's 95 units with 40 project based vouchers. We're hoping if we get all the financing for this project, we'll start construction by the end of the year. And with Last Fontana's Apartments, this is at the corner of Long Beach and PCH, we're very excited about this project.'",
        "'speaker_9': '101 units with 40 project based vouchers. This will also begin construction at the end of the year and then again spares apartments that was also preserved with 29 project based vouchers. 1.3 is to continue to waive developer impact fees for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is also ongoing and recent fee waivers include Emmanuel Place, Anchor Place, The Beacon, The Spark at Midtown Las Fontana's Apartments and Vista del Puerto. Here, the total value of these vouchers. I'm sorry. These waivers is over $3 million, resulting in the funding for 552 units.'",
        "'speaker_9': '1.4 is to promote the city's density bonus program. This is also ongoing. The program is regularly promoted by two housing developers, by both planning and economic development staff, housing staff as well. I think a lot of the recent affordable projects have taken advantage of the density bonus program.'",
        "'speaker_9': '1.5 is to continue to partner with developers in the pursuit of housing funding, and this is also ongoing. And in fiscal year 17, staff assisted with funding applications for the beacon in the amount of $70.4 million. And we're currently working on funding applications for Last Fontana's Apartments, The Spark at Midtown Vista, still Porto.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in total these projects will include $174.2 million in leveraged funds and $19.5 million in city funds. Policy 1.6 is to explore the development of student and workforce housing. This is also something that the economic development staff and housing staff discuss when they meet with developers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When we meet with developers, which is pretty regular. And then there is an exciting new project that the Planning Commission just approved on the Broadway block that includes 400 units, 14 of which are affordable, which was a voluntary A for affordable allocation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then that that project includes housing for students and faculty, of course, who will be. 1.8 is to support sector reform. This is also ongoing during this one. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I missed 1.7 track federal and state housing legislation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is ongoing through the city manager's office. In fiscal year 17, the city supported funding for CDBG at home programs SB two, which is the Building Homes and Job Act that will give direct funding to the city for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then SB three, which is the Veterans and Affordable Housing Bond Act. That's a $4 billion general obligation bond that will be on the ballot in November. 1.8. Support seeker reform. This is coordinated through the city manager's office and there are currently eight bills in the at the state level that are under review.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And 1.9 is to create and maintain a database of publicly held land that maybe may provide housing for housing opportunities, excuse me. And economic development is preparing a comprehensive list of potential development opportunity sites throughout the city, including government owned sites and privately held sites.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The city also notifies market rate developers of housing, operating or affordable housing developers of opportunities when they dispose of city owned land. Here is our next section 2.1. Accessory Dwelling Unit Ordinance. This has been completed adopted by the Planning Commission on July six, 2017 and the City Council on December 19, 2017.'",
        "'speaker_9': '2.2 implement state requirements for reduced parking for affordable housing. At the time that this was put in here, it was AB 744 was the bill that imposed new parking restrictions. And although the city has not codified that state bill, the city is implementing that bill and all of our recent developments have been able to take advantage of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that. So. 2.3 contact financial analysis and next to study the coastal zone. And Lucy. This, I admit, has been going on for a long time. But we do have a financial analysis from our consultant. We have met with community groups.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will be proposing some significant, I think, increases to the in lieu fees for the coastal zone program. We are working with the city attorney's office currently on preparing an ordinance or a changes to our existing ordinance, and we're hoping to have that back to the council in September.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the same goes for the condominium conversion ordinance 2.4. Again, we met with the advocate groups and hope to have that back in September. 3.1 explore a local bond measure as a one time source to capitalize the housing trust fund.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we did some analysis on this. We sent a memorandum up to the Mayor and Council on September 25th, 2017. Our analysis indicated that to develop a thousand units of affordable housing, we would need about $126 million in subsidy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so should the should the council council wish to proceed with a bond measure, city staff would conduct further analysis to refine those numbers. 3.2 began the development of an inclusionary housing policy. And so the good news to hear is that AB 1505 was adopted in 2017 and this clears the way to allow for inclusionary and rental'",
        "'speaker_9': 'projects, whereas previously it was only allowed in for sale projects. We released an RFP in October. We actually had interviews with consultants just a few weeks ago and we're wrapping that up and hopefully we'll have a contract in place by the end of the month.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that will take about a year. A large chunk of that is community outreach. But there's analysis that has to be done and and some modeling and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the community is ready for it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We know where to find you. And then 3.3, investigate the possibility of establishing establishing a local document recording fee to fund affordable housing. This is ongoing. You know, as I mentioned earlier, this, the legislature adopted SB two in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're still trying to understand what that means. That could bring anywhere from 2 to $300, $300,000 in funding. And as we understand it, some of that money will be allocated directly to cities. And we're hoping and we believe that Long Beach will be one of those cities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that will be a tool for us to help fund affordable housing. 3.4 Investigate the possibility of dedicating city resources for affordable housing. We do this annually during our budget process and in fiscal year 18 we asked for funding, but there were no general fund dollars available for this purpose.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I, I will say, though, that funds deposited into our housing fund from successor agency loan repayments for this year are about $5 million. And then, of course, our federal home funds are about $2.1 million and the housing authority is $75.6 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Policy 3.6 modify the. The moderate income definition to include up to 150% i. This is pending. This is not something that we have made a decision on. This is something we will consider in conjunction with any new source of funding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And during the inclusionary housing study in mid-May or may not be a good idea. 3.7 Encourage the adoption of specific plans to encourage a more rapid entitlement process. This is ongoing, and I'm sure we all remember that the general plan, land use element, urban design element, place type and height maps were approved by the City Council last'",
        "'speaker_9': 'week. The Southeast Area Specific plan was adopted by the Council in September of 2017 and the mid-term plan was adopted in 2016. And we're already seeing several new projects in the Midtown Plan area. 3.8 Consider expanding one for one replacement in areas outside the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is pending and this will follow after we are done updating the coastal zone in Lee and Lucy program. 3.9 develop and offer first time homebuyer programs. This is also in process. We have begun some research here on the cost to offer homebuyer programs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're also researching we're partnering with our economic development staff, and we're researching lending practices and partnerships and homebuyer education programs. 3.10. Encourage the adoption of regulations to allow and incentivize shipping container construction for housing. This is ongoing. We sent a memo up to the Mayor and council on August 2nd, 2017 on this that provides a little bit'",
        "'speaker_9': 'more information with the memo outlining the suitability, advantages and requirements associated with the use of shipping containers as housing units. Currently, staff is working with local and regional groups to establish development standards that currently do not exist.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, let's get to the presentation with the public comment on.'",
        "'speaker_9': '33.2 study short term rental regulations. And this is in process. We have a consultant on board and we're expecting to take about six months to complete this with a proposal to the Council in the fall of 2018. 3.13 ensure that sufficient resources are available to implement the city's proactive rental housing inspection program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is also ongoing, and for fiscal year 18, fees for existing services were increased by 2.23%, resulting in a $5 increase to each of the three tiers of fees for the program. No new fees or services were included in the fiscal year 18 budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': '3.14 explore the feasibility of using new structures such as enhanced infrastructure financing districts. This is pending as is 3.15 Explore Article 34 Referendum 3.16. Provide the necessary city staffing resources to manage increased housing production contemplated by these policies.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this will be done as part of our annual budget process and in conjunction with any new funding that we receive as part of these policies. So conclusions and next steps. We expect the following accomplishments for 2018 additional housing preservation, additional project based vouchers continue and begin construction on 403 new units.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Develop a citywide inclusionary housing policy. Develop a short term, short term rental regulations. Complete an update to the coastal zone and legal fee program and the condominium conversion ordinance. And then there are some additional initiatives that the Council requested on January 16th and February six relating to tenant protection programs and homeowner assistance programs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we are beginning to research those items as well. And that concludes my presentation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Let me go back to start with the maker of the motion. I know you didn't speak to this motion. Did you have any comments? Customary, Ringo, by summary. Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I'll just say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, it is late and folks have been waiting on this for a long time. When do we. I need clarity on this. Some of this stuff is like red meat stuff like the inclusionary housing policy and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What does that timeline actually look like for the inclusionary housing recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vice Mayor The inclusionary housing policy will begin right away. Once we have a consultant on board, which is going to be at the end of March, it's going to be about a year to get from that point to when we get back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I support yeah, I support that. I think it was more politically challenging to do five years ago, but it's pretty standard now and a year from now, you know, it takes a lot of time to develop. So the sooner we can sort of expedite that process, the better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and I saw you mentioned some of the work we talked about with some of the barriers to homeownership. You know, the barriers becoming more difficult. So have we sort of begun the conversations with, you know, some of the folks who spoke and talked about the resources for down payment assistance?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have we done those conversations yet?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We had a meeting scheduled with HSBC Bank last week, but that got postponed until I believe it's tomorrow or Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we economic development staff and housing staff have met and we have started talking about this. We also have a consultant working on some cost for subsidy programs, which is just one component. And that really comes out of these 29 policies.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the the research that's related to the March or February six request has been started, but we do still have some work to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. That's fine. And then the last thing is, you know, I know there's a lot of conversation about rent control. You know, I'm not you know, I'm not necessarily there yet. But I think there's a lot of questions and a lot of statements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, I got the floor listen to use my time. I think the renter protection piece, though, you know, we've heard enough to see that we have to we need to be doing more on the rent protection stuff, particularly when people are you know, I mean, look, we have we have to take it more seriously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need to have the tough conversations about renter protections. And so my question is, what's the timeline? Look, I know that there was a motion, but what's the timeline to actually get the ball rolling on that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We are conducting research right now and we are planning on we have actually started working on what we think our schedule will be, but we do not have a date certain yet. But we are planning to have a memo up to the mayor and council within the next couple of weeks that will provide a timeline for that'",
        "'speaker_1': '. A couple of weeks we will know more. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. I'm just going to just jump in because I just want to follow up. The vice mayor said, I just wanna go back first. There's three things I want to bring up. First of all, on the inclusionary, I think the report's great, but to me the three things that stand out is one is the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'inclusionary zoning ordinance. So I'm trying to understand why it would take a year. No question. Can we please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Expert? Let me jump in a little bit on kind of the process and how this how we came to be where we're at. So when we got direction from the Mayor and council in May, that was really the kind of first policy direction of go forward and do this inclusionary housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We went to the budget immediately, got money to put that in the budget and you adopted that in in October. And immediately in October we put it out on RFP. So this is going to be a big planning effort.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a lot of technical capability that we're going to need and also to keep all the development projects going. We have a lot of affordable housing projects going, we have a lot of other projects going through needed additional resources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've done the RFP, we're bringing on the consultant, and then there are a number of steps in and Patrick can go through these. Public outreach is going to be important. That's probably going to be at least several months long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to do the research of what other cities do, come up with their recommendations, go to planning commission and then come back to council. So there's going to be steps you see along the way. The year is really from start to the very finish to where you're actually putting something into place, but there's going to be'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a lot of work you're going to see in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I would just I mean, I appreciate that. I would just challenge us that it just seems like we could just do this faster than a year. And I think this part this this piece of the policy, there's to me just some general consensus that we there's support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that this is how we get more housing affordability immediately. And so. Can we cut that down? And listen, I don't I don't want to I don't want to skimp on public outreach or going through the planning process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I would just just if we can just please at least look towards a way to get this back in front of the council sooner that I think I think most people would appreciate that. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll take a look at doing whatever we can. We do want to reserve some time for the public outreach, but if that's something that we need to shrink a little bit on, if we need to look, if we can go faster as well with the policy recommendations and not do as broad of a study, we can look'",
        "'speaker_5': 'at areas to tighten that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to make sure that we ask whoever the consultant is that's going to that we're bringing on and we challenge the consultant to do this in a shorter time period. I think that would be and and if we're going to shorten it, let's not shorten the public input part, but if we can just shorten some'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of that, that would be we'll.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Go we'll go as fast as we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The second thing is, the other one I think that makes a immediate impact is the short term rentals. I think this is a that I'm not also sure why this one is taking as long as it is. Can you please explain that to us?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So short term rentals was the same. We were given direction to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We got that immediately in the budget. We did an RFP process. We are selecting. We have selected one that falls under the City Managers Authority. So we don't we're not having to come back to council for that one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have them on board right now. They're starting their public outreach in March and we expect to be back in the fall on that. Actually, even though it's six months is very aggressive. The city of L.A., by the way, is that year, two and a half of trying to do short term rentals, and there aren't any closer'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to actually getting it done. So a lot of cities that we've seen, this has been a 2 to 3 year process to get short term rentals and we're looking to get it done in six months. So we're going to be doing a number of community outreach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We really believe it's important to get out and talk to the community on short term rentals. There's a lot of different opinions. We'll be interviewing stakeholders who are doing community meetings and then doing the research and bringing that back both planning, commission and council, hopefully by fall.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you think and you think this will get to planning commission in the summer? If I remember the schedule, right, it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was probably August around that time, the Planning Commission and September or so for council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think and again, I know that there's a an important planning process to go through on this. And so I'm not trying to in any way cause any issues there. But again, I think this is another issue that could bring immediate benefit relief.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's a lot of interest in the city in getting a short term rental policy in place. I think that there are some communities that have implemented them. I know that L.A. has been a very different sort of situation, but you're saying that community input or give the community process starting this month?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So we're going to be actually next week interviewing all the council members first and getting kind of your sense of who are the stakeholders you're hearing from. We're going to be doing specific stakeholder interviews so that we get a sense of all the different aspects of people who want to be involved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we're going to be doing at least three different community meetings throughout the city along the process to get input, share data, share the data that we've received, talk about some of the recommendations, and then staff will come forward with a proposed recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And the last thing, I think the vice touched on it as well. I think, you know, the sooner that we can get staff's initial first pass on the studies and the look at the tenant protections that the council passed, I think a big part of that was the kind of national review of what other cities are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'doing comparable to Long Beach. And I think that the sooner that comes back to the council, particularly the data on what other cities are doing, I think is important for the council to make some decisions there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, yes, we understand that that is important. We do have a small but mighty housing staff. Most of them are behind me right now. So we will be looking at that one and we don't have a budget for that, but we actually are putting a lot of effort into learning this kind of newer field for us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we will be bringing those forward again. A couple of weeks will give you an update of what we've accomplished and what else we still have left to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much, Councilmember Pierson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you staff for sharing with us the two from four memos and giving us a digestible breakdown of that. And I do I want to echo my colleague's sentiment and even echoed the sentiment of those in the audience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is frustrating because we are a big city with a big vision and we're tackling a lot and so feeling like this is going a little slow. I completely feel the same way and I want to thank staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that you guys just went through the land use element and that we are short staffed with Tom sitting in as director right now. So recognizing those challenges, I know that this is a received file. A couple of things that I want to highlight is with for the inclusionary policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look at making sure that we are having the consultants look at both rental and owners to include the highest percentage that we think that we can get to. Also identifying that community process and realizing that it's not as debatable or as intense as STR.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So hopefully we can figure out a community engagement process that gets us back to this group sooner. And also wanting to follow up on where we are with the Mello Act. I didn't necessarily see a timeline for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did I miss that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember. Are you referring to the coastal zone and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We should be back in September on that one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And I know last week I spoke a lot about no net loss. And it says in here that we'll look at no net loss after we look at that. Is there a way for us to report back on no net loss at that same time?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When you're I'm sorry. When you refer to no net loss you're referring.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All on I'll find your your phrases for this is what happens when you've been doing work in the housing community and then you have to learn new words.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Expanding one for one replacement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. I think you're referring to there's a 1.8 replacement requirement in the coastal zone. And at last week's council meeting, you asked for the status of one for one replacement outside of the coastal zone. So that is not on our work program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But based on your comment last week, we're finding a way to put that on the work program. Additionally, there are some changes in state law that took effect January 1st of this year that require us to implement no net loss outside of the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have a number of report backs that were requested last week. We're working with the city manager to work through all of those. So we can't give you that answer tonight. But you will be receiving a TFF type document about all of the report backs from last week's meeting, and it will give you a clear timeline'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for that item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Just to be clear, it's 3.8 on the presentation you guys just gave. So it does say that 3.8 consider expanding one for one replacement, the area outside of the coastal zone. This item will follow up after 2.3.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to make sure that we're on a on a track to where we don't have to wait another year after.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I understood and it was on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A longer track and based on your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Comments last week, we're looking at what we can do to move it up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so very much. One other thing that you know, in the conversation around rental protections, it's not in this presentation. I brought it up in one of my briefings today. One of the concerns I have and I'm going to bring it up publicly today and then follow up with staff on how we move forward on it'",
        "'speaker_2': '. But one of the challenges that I'm having is that we are having homes or apartments that have illegal conversions that might have been done ten years ago or 20 years ago. And for whatever reason, it seems like we're seeing an increase of people being evicted because they have to go in and the landlord needs to make changes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or revert back to the original intent. And one of those cases is even the the women's shelter has a home in my district. And so they've had to remove a whole apartment based on an illegal conversion that was done years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in the future, when we bring up renter issues, I want us to talk about how we're dealing with illegal conversions and what that what those numbers are and if there's any benefit that we as a city can help landlords get to code without removing tenants so that we are in fact protecting existing housing and not losing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that in the middle of our time, in the middle of our crunch. So I appreciate the efforts and I expect to in the next month or so, have a deeper conversation around our housing stock. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. And I just want to solidify I have to say it on the dais as well, my support and urge for us to just get up and running and started as soon as possible with the inclusionary housing rental protections, of course, shipping, container construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that will be going through the process and talking to each council member, but I really hope we emphasize on directly working with the impacted neighborhoods. As we know, lots of people, especially in my district, are getting evicted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are getting sort of thrown out of their their space. And so we want to make sure that we're doing this as soon as possible for for that reason. And then I know we're in this transition. So I just hope that and I don't know what the the timeline is for our new development just development services director'",
        "'speaker_3': ', but I hope that whoever that might be is going to be up to date and up to speed with all of this. And that includes an equitable distribution of affordable housing throughout the city. And so I just have to put it out there, but I thank you very much for the work and I look forward to engaging'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in those stakeholder meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to thank staff for the report as well. I do want to make a correction because I think when we've talked about the short term rental options, we've been a little bit dismissive. Not just that, not just development services, but we had a report from Financial Services a few weeks ago that had short term rentals in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'there as a possible run of revenue gap and filler. And that's a concern to me because I have many communities in my district that are adamantly opposed to us allowing short term rentals, which are illegal right now. And so it's important for me to be able to advocate for that community and to that community that that outreach'",
        "'speaker_7': 'has not even started, that they will be involved in that outreach, that, you know, there's a lot of data out there about whether short term rentals actually limit affordable housing because they're taking away spaces that can be used for long term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But again, these are all discussions that I'm hoping that we can have. But I think to to talk about short term rentals as if it's it's something that's definitely happening would be ill advised because that's certainly not the intent of everyone on council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I do think staff I love to see that so many of these policies are implemented. There's a great deal of work to be done. I'm happy to have been part of the creation of a lot more housing in the Ccep area, although I don't know to what extent that's going to qualify in terms of affordable'",
        "'speaker_7': 'housing, but it is providing some additional housing stock and it has yet to be determined what the price points will be. But I think in regards to our work, there's a lot more work to be done. And again, for my residents who may be watching at home, we have not approved short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've not set a policy on short term rentals. We are not relying on short term rentals as any sort of solution for the city of Long Beach. That conversation is just getting started this month. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'd like to confirm that also 3.12, which is the policy that the council asked us to move forward with, was to study short term rentals. So we haven't made any conclusions about what that program will look like.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's why we're bringing on the extra help and some great analysis of what has worked in other cities. And then we'll be doing the public outreach and coming back to you with some recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Since we're on the short term rentals discussion, can you clarify for me? Because it was my impression that even though Los Angeles has no official short term rental policy and they've been working on it for a few years, that they are charging it to vote on on units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that and I mean, they're receiving tens of millions of dollars without a policy. Is that true or not?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they have they basically are collecting only from one of the providers through a voluntary tax sharing agreement to $2 on a use that is illegal in the city of Los Angeles. So it is a very strange situation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've been following and tracking this a lot. We have not recommended as your staff that you do that because that precludes you from really making decisions about, you know, how and where you should create your own program because you've accepted the money and you've already program that money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're close. We are, as your budget staff are projecting, that you should be looking at that money starting the next year's budget. We're being very conservative with that, and it's an estimate at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you in in this public phase, that's that's about to start on this issue. I would also like just additional information on that piece, because it is it is clear to me that many municipalities in which short term rentals are, quote unquote, not allowed are collecting significant funds into or out of which governments are using for a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'variety of reasons, whether it's additional housing opportunities or other uses. I just want to make sure that that I understand exactly what's happening in these other cities. And and maybe it's not a good idea for us. And I can I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but I want to understand that piece more because I don't have enough information about it. Sure. Thank you. Councilman Mangum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Modica, in my understanding, the types of revenues that they're using are being programed against one time expenses. And furthermore, if you currently do any illegal activity and create a income from it, the federal government collects income tax against it and this would be no different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, putting it into a fee schedule, the city of Los Angeles to date, I believe, has received $56 million. And so to not allow this group of individuals to be on an even playing field when this council is often fighting over 250.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thousand dollars. And where to put our afterschool programs? I would encourage us to have a discussion sooner rather than later, and I would not limit it to one provider. I would encourage us to ensure that the top five providers know that even while this is not a permitted use, any operation of those programs in the city shall'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be created with the same 12% total that are leveraged against our hotels so that that money can go back into our communities and ensure, even if we set it into a fund specifically for helping out in understanding the communities that are most impacted by not having rental access to to just leave that money on the table seems'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Point made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we are looking at, if you remember, the July budget projection we are looking at including that money in our FY19 budget. So we are looking at putting $900,000 into the budget. It's a conservative estimate and it is you know, we're not at the level of an LA, but we are looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And right now, the only way to collect that without an ordinance would be through that. One company of the five is the only one that allows that. If we were to go forward with a with an ordinance, we would be looking at collecting it from every single one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we are seeing that as a revenue opportunity. We would require anyone who does a short term or two to pay our full 12% total under a program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Motoko, I appreciate your perspective. If we set a fee and state that anyone participating in the use of short term housing is required to pay that fee just because the platform that they're using would not make a transfer of that funding to us easy and convenient does not mean that they would be that they would be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exempt from paying it. So if, for instance, I was a neighbor, let's say in the 1988 off of Wardlow Road and I was renting out my property on a platform other than the one you mention. And I rented out my property 65 days a year at $100 a night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then that $6,500 would then generate 12% that I would be responsible for coming down to City Hall with my check and turning it in and stating, Here's the money that I owe you. I mean, just because the platform that they would be using is not Airbnb, be willing to give us an agreement does not mean that you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cannot have a fee associated with a use that is not currently ordinance that I mean, that would be my argument. It seems as though with that kind of money on the table, it should at least be before this dais to make that decision, because every single day that's passing, if you have what is the estimated number of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'units we believe are on the market in Long Beach at this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't have it off the top of my head, but it's probably over a thousand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So over a thousand at 30% rental would be 300 units at an average of 150 at night times 12%. I mean, we're just watching money not come in that I think is is irresponsible. So thank you so much for hearing us out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope that this item comes back before us. I recognize that there still does need to have a robust discussion about this as an ordinance and as a policy. But that process, if it's going to take till the fall, that's six months of revenue, that could be for our children.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I wanted to queue up, just to be clear. Obviously, this issue is going to be a hot issue and we will have a long night whenever this issue comes before us. I definitely do not support receiving revenue on an illegal operation in the city if it's not legal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should not be taking revenue because that tells companies across the board that they can come here and try to bribe us to pass a policy. So I would say that and saying that I hope that that encourages us to get this item before us sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that because they took that step in L.A., it has made creating the policy extremely difficult because there is now money on the table that you cannot vote to take that money away should it happen. Thank you, Stacy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it makes it very difficult. And so I just want to say, we need to have the entire conversation as one package. That was my intent when I agenda was the item. And making sure that we do have constituents from across the board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It also last time when we talked about Oscars, it wasn't reflected in staff's notes that I wanted to make sure that we were exploring using that fund to fund affordable housing. It was not my intent to put that agenda item to say here, this all goes to the general fund, and I know that's how it's already been'",
        "'speaker_2': 'allocated in the budget, and that's not something I support either. And I know that from talking to the different platforms in this process, that they are supportive of trying to balance out an affordable housing challenge that we do have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I know that we all have a different idea of what short term rental policy could look like. And it sounds like staff has an idea, as you just said, you would come to the city and tell us what to do with that total.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We haven't voted yet, so we need to make sure that we get this item here soon so we can have a thorough, transparent conversation instead of talking about the what ifs every time we bring this up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Councilmember Councilmember. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This council supports the collection of authorized sale of marijuana, which is federally illegal. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is completely unrelated, related to how late it is. But I just want to say I just want to say, you know, these council C measure how many items that we do last year, city council agenda items. You got any idea?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have no idea. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think I don't think it's going to be less next year. I think meetings are going to get like later and later. And frankly, it's just unfair because this these are good issues. And I bet more people would be here and want to engage in this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So all I'm saying is I just want to say maybe I know people may throw a dagger at me for saying this, but maybe we bring a council meeting on the fifth Tuesday when months are like really jam to try to take some pressure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry, Sylvia. Don't throw the dagger, but. But I'm just saying, these are I mean, it's it's like. It's like almost midnight. It's like two weeks in a row. I just think at some point we've got to figure out, I mean, we're not having the same agendas that we had before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know if it's the fifth Tuesday. I don't want I we got to figure something out. I'm just saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much. There is a motion and a second take public comment on on the presentation. Sorry to the the the lady and actually can we get the lady in the front, please? Who was first in line?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You guys will get it. Good evening, council and mayor and Vice Mayor. My name is Iyana Cobb, and I think what everyone was trying to do is just kind of get their comments is what they wanted to say since they have been here all night.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not that they wanted to hear the presentation tonight, that they just wanted to say, I just want to get out. I've been here for like 17 hours. So but anyway, I am a U.S. veteran. I'm an Army veteran of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I just want to say that instead of us going outside looking for other examples, I was a homeless veteran and in the city of Long Beach, and it was something that I never thought that would happen to me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Fortunately enough, I landed in the Cabrillo Century Villages, which has done an amazing job. They have amazing resources. Obviously, there's still a lot of things to do, and I think that's an opportunity for the city to actually look at that model, sit down and talk to them and see how they did some things instead of us using'",
        "'speaker_8': 'our resources. Kind of go out of that is great though. We do have a lot of buildings that are being built for public vouchers, but it still does not resolve the issue with regards to preexisting housing that does not have rent control.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's like we're banding bandaged in it. We're not really treating the issue. We're kind of tap dancing around the situation, not me, myself, that will eventually become a homeowner going through this process. I understand that we don't want to oversight how someone owns homes and how they, you know, issue our rents to people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, at the same time, we also have to realize the health and welfare issue with someone becomes homeless and that also affects their mental wellness. And then it just took us out to a whole lot of different other things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some stories I've heard where rents are increase within 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. If you're on a job, you're lucky if you get a raise in a year. So to just kind of like keep giving them, you know, raising the rents is just kind of exorbitant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just a quick scenario. For example, I was in a situation where my daughter was still in school. I had already given my notice to my other apartment. Complex wants to move into a current apartment complex before I became homeless.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I didn't think to ask what the fee was for because common sense would say the the life will probably be about $25, maybe 50. But when I want to go sign the lease here in Long Beach with Cabin Group Property Management, the late fee was $150 and my rent was only $895.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Like, Okay, I can either sign this now, I'll be in the car with my daughter. So I think there needs to be a lot of oversight with regards to rent control, property management companies, how they do things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And also when we control topic comes up next week, it should be in the beginning of the agenda so that everyone will have an opportunity to actually engage in the conversation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Hi, Mayor. City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name's Gary Shelton. Years ago, when I was first dealing with affordable housing issues, we worked really, really hard on campaigns to have inclusionary zoning and a housing trust fund. We got the housing trust fund with no money in it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We never got inclusionary housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, that was a dirty word back then. Another dirty word was SRO, single room occupancy. But guess what, folks? We've got it now in zones all over the city. We finally got it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks to you all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Guess what else? Rent control. We're going to be doing a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Talking about rent control over the next year or two. Starting next week. It hasn't already started.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I'm saying is that the previous councils did a lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of work that got us nowhere, got us to here, where we're finally dealing with some of these issues and get them on getting them on the plate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One that when we were looking at the downtown plan, we had a campaign about that to temper that down a little bit. We were guaranteed we were promised by council member IT chair one council member. It chaired two different council before you folks that there would be no gentrification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what do these mean people been talking about? They've been talking about getting kicked out of their places because they're being gentrified.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Out of their units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. Now, what I'd like to have heard from this instead of all this. Oh, we're planning this. We've got this going on. We've got these plans going out. Exactly what you asked for, Mr. Mayor, which was immediate impact items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what can we do to cut down the timeline on this? Because previous councils have always stretched out the timeline. Previous staffs have always stretched out the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Timelines on these things. What I'd like you to ask them, though, tonight is to look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The arena numbers that we have that we're not matching right now. Remember when we had 873% up above median and 17% of low and moderate? Low and extremely low and very low. We're doing the same thing right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I want to hear is how many housing units have we lost to gentrification compared to how many? If you add it up, what Mr.. Your report was I couldn't add it up. Was it 50 units? Was 150 was 800.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know. Whatever the total number of units that are on the ground right now with keys being unlocked and lights being turned on compared to what we lost in gentrification just over the last year. Ask that question and see how you like that answer, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Shelton, next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I'm tired, too. I'm trying to gather my thoughts together because I can think it's been a long day. But I am a homeowner. I'm a homeowner in the ninth district. I lived on Hewlett and Elm. I bought my house two years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks to my union, I could afford it, I. I have a various apartments that are right around my home, and recently some of the neighbors that I've got gotten to know since I moved into my property. They moved out and I saw signs going up and the signs are saying that the rent for a single bedroom apartment'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with no parking is $1,600. And I'm baffled because my home, it has three rooms, two bath garage, and I paid $2,000 for a mortgage. And I find it appalling that I hear that the districts that are mostly homeowners are putting a proposition now to talk about rent control or talk about rent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When, you know, as a homeowner, I cannot consciously make a profit and build equity knowing that my community is suffering. I can't do that. It makes me angry when I see two, three families living in one apartment because they can't afford it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is not an uncommon conversation in Long Beach to know that somebody that you love or know has either been evicted, has to have a bunch of roommates in order to survive. Even in a union wage. Most union workers can't afford to live in Long Beach and working Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is very concerning because these are the best paid hospitality jobs right now in Long Beach. What are we going to do? Are we going to really be that city that outsources our workers because we don't want them to live here?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This reminds me of the zoning laws of the twenties in the forties and fifties, where people of color could not, you know, their communities were not invested in and they had to go live a far away and walk in the alley.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, one of my coworkers, he tells me that he was in the he remembers the day that the first day he was able to walk on Pine Avenue because he's black. And, you know, he just got evicted from his house, from his apartment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, it's just we got to do better. Honestly, this is this is a conversation that I feel like it's pretty obvious if we have companies that are coming in and paying $3 million for an apartment complex and, you know, are charging $6,000 for rent, they could afford more than 14 units to be affordable for Long'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Beach residents. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can we say resident of the first district? And I'm really tired. So if I don't make sense, I apologize in advance, see if I can read my notes. There is so much going on with housing in our community right now and we cannot keep up with what's happening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have these large corporate landlords that are coming in and buying property, anticipating making huge profit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Profits on short term rentals in conjunction with the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Olympics. We're seeing it downtown. We're seeing it in the north side of town. They're going into the low income areas. I work at the senior center, used to be once a week I'd have somebody come in and tell me that their rent had been raised 2 to $300 and they're on fixed income.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was their food budget. What were they going to do? How could they get access to food? I tried to find housing for a woman that was becoming homeless. She had to go to L.A. to even get any.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Services because there was nothing in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The building next to the one that the people were there, their residents all got two and $300 a month income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're all seniors on fixed incomes. My building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Contract expires this year. We've had some of our residents have been given notice that their buildings are going to be they're going to be moved from one bedrooms to studios so they can convert the one bedrooms to market rate units.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who's tracking that? Nobody's tracking that. There's 33 plus senior buildings in the city. That's another great net loss that we could be experience. Most of those contracts expire in the next few years. Short term rentals. I was here when those people got up and I couldn't believe, why isn't somebody penalizing those?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those are people in the community. And they were proudly announcing that they were making huge profits on their. I was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appalled.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's find them. They're doing something illegal. We're talking about condemning our immigrant population. And these people are proudly announcing that they're in any illegal business and we're not fining them. I find that incredible. The rent freeze. We need to look at a rent freeze.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Otherwise, we are going to see more and more seniors out on the streets. I have been homeless. I don't want to be homeless again and I don't want any of our seniors to experience that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi there. Jordan Wynn, again, thank you once again for everybody sticking out tonight. I know it's a late night, but hopefully this is reminding you of your activist days. So I'm going to tell a little bit of a story about who I am in relation to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am in a family of renters. We've always rented our home and we've lived in three different homes as long as I've been here. I was born and raised. I lived in the third district, then the fifth District, and now I live in the seventh District in Roberto Aranguiz.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I graduated from Long Beach Poly and I was lucky enough from the space program to be able to get into a small liberal arts school in Portland called Reed College. For my senior thesis, I researched the phenomenon of gentrification, specifically gentrification in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, and I analyzed three different unit, three different census tracts to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'track the ways in which the units were changing and the populations were changing at the same time. And what I found was astounding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gentrification is a fact fast.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Acting process that happens within 3 to 7 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Something that takes place rapidly. It's a crisis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In downtown L.A. right now. It's actually been identified as the most gentrified place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I came back eager.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To help my city, eager to give back to the community that had given me so much. And what do I find when I come back to our downtown? The same exact phenomenon, gentrification going on downtown and across our city today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Somebody actually told me that a unit on Walnut and Fourth Street, which used to be pretty affordable neighborhood, a studio.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is now going for.'",
        "'speaker_5': '1700 dollars in this city of Long Beach, which is unbelievable for me as a student coming back. I don't have anywhere to live. I'm living at my parents house. My parents just got a rent increase of $300. So where am I going with all this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How does this relate to the study? Well, you know, there's a lot of cool policies that have been outlined, but I think the most important have been sidelined or way far back in the policy process. For example, policies three, one and three, two I cited in the the presentation are in process and pending it are some of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the most dire needs for our city. It's one of the ones that is least for the furthest down on the policy pipeline. 3.4 not being available from general funds when 40% of our fiscal responsibility from the city was spent on police really makes me question who we're protecting here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The people who are going to come into the city or the people who are already living here. And then.'",
        "'speaker_0': '310 we can have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Affordable developments, but those can often be parts of gentrification process as we've seen around the country. And I'm wondering with things like what Rex Richardson presented last month, where is that discussion? I appreciate it. And bringing that up tonight, where is REP?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where is rent control?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where is just cause eviction? And the discussion about this? And most importantly, where is wealth building in our most vulnerable communities?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These policies that have been presented.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tonight are for a city that is not in crisis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It may be standard process now, as Rex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Richardson said earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is no longer a standard issue. This is a housing crisis. We are dealing with people who are receiving rent increases of 300, 400, 500, $800.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At a time. And my family might get this place of the city. I don't know where I'm going to go after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The mayor wants to know what.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The standard among cities are when it comes to renter protections. And I can tell you with a firm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A firm statement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That it is renter protections. Look into it and thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm fucking livid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I swear you don't know what's going on. You're asking questions about these things that apparently has been in the works for so long. I'm just like, God damn. My name is Jennifer and I'm a student, Cece UAB. And the only reason I'm able to live where I live, where I live is because I'm using my financial.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Aid, all of it, to go to my rent. I don't think my friends even know this, but over the summer I was homeless. I was looking for housing in L.A., and I only found it here. And that's because I had financial aid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you have people who are being evicted, who have who are disabled, who can't afford better living right now. You guys have the audacity to call this a receive and file. It's a fucking emergency. We might be homeless.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At least you'll have homes to go to tonight. I'm calling on you as the people who make the decisions in Long Beach to protect renters in this city. I am one of 60% of renter population that this this fucking city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many people are being displaced for no fucking reason, not just because of big shit. And that's perfectly legal because we don't got rent control. I stand with all renters who speak out against the injustices due to gentrification. You all really need to fucking do something about this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's see what happens if we cut your salaries. How fucking fast you're going to get this shit through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know you have a right to speak to. Please. I just would appreciate this. The language. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, because I hurts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm just. I'm. You are. You have a personal right to say what you want. I just wanted to say that you have a right to say whatever you want. Continue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, fine. Fuck it. Look into temporary rent. Freeze and just cause eviction until November. Until you guys decide to get together and actually do something about this temporary rent freeze. No more building those goddamn things outside the construction around in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stop over until you guys come together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And actually do something about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of Long Beach residents to decide on rent control because we need it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaker, please. Hi, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Ben. I'm a resident of the ninth District. I've spoken in front of city council before regarding affordable housing issues in the past. I guess what I really want to talk about is just to really let you all know, you know, what informs us and I know this is something the city council is trying to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do, is really inform themselves about the issues. And oftentimes I hear from city council members when we bring up issues that the public is not informed or that we're misinformed. And so I want to offer the experiences that have formed my, you know, my, you know, living in Long Beach for the past 20 years, my family living'",
        "'speaker_4': 'here. And also really to explain the anger that I think a lot of us have when speaking to city council members. When my family first immigrated here to the United States to Long Beach, renting was the most affordable option we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we moved around and we we eventually settled in a spot on Orange and San Antonio in Bixby Knolls that my family lived in for several years. And we were evicted because my mom had complained about several pest issues that were occurring in the apartment complex.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And because Long Beach doesn't have any just cause eviction laws, you know, my mom was given no other option but to find another place. And for my mom to have that courage to speak out to her landlord to fix those issues and maintain the property was really difficult because I also come from an undocumented immigrant family and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as a single mother, this was very important for her to maintain the well-being of her family and provide a home we faced housing insecurity for. I faced housing insecurity for a majority of my life. And actually for about two years I had my family of five, a single mother and four sons lived and essentially what was a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'smaller than a studio, a back house of one of our family friends in the ninth District. And so, you know, this issue is very urgent. As people have said, this is a housing. We're not in a housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're in a housing emergency in Long Beach. And it's not just affecting Long Beach. It's affecting the whole state. And so what we do here ripples to the whole state. And we have to take leadership locally. We can't just stand and take a whole year to do a study of of what other cities are doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know that other cities in California have have set precedents for how we should establish rights for renters. 15 cities in the state of California alone have rent control, and more cities have just cause eviction policies. And their cities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are cities with smaller renter populations Long Beach, the 60% renter populated city. You would expect that we would have a baseline of standards for how we should treat our renters because they deserve to have this. They deserve to have some stability if they decide to rent and live in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for many of us, Long Beach has been affordable. And with the changes we've had, with the growth that we have, we have to look at different options and respond to what's happening now, because if we don't respond now, it'll be too late.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we'll lose we'll lose the language that we've we've we've learned a lot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, and members of the city council. I for the record, I wanted to hear the presentation from city staff. So thank you very much. I know that a lot of hard work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Has.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Been put in by the community and that we have had community meetings, we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Had public meetings and we have taken.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Public input. And I agree with the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That it seems pretty clear that there is consensus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Among this body and the public that we want to see an inclusionary housing possible right away. And if that can happen, then this body does need to consider a a freeze on development until we can get that policy put in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You also need to be considering a rent freeze until the election. You're all taking this item up next week now, making it now a much larger part of the public discourse now. And so now that that's happening, landlords are getting even more nervous.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as they get more nervous, they're raising their rents. All of this is going to create a more work in the back end because when that passes, renters are going to go back and they're going to go back and get their money back from the landlords who've been gouging them in an effort to try and raise the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'rent as much as they can. Before we passed an ordinance that actually does protect renters in the city, something that we have failed to do. What are other cities doing? They're passing rent control and just cause eviction. There are seven cities right now in California, including Long Beach, that are working on getting to the ballot in November'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Long Beach is the largest city from San Diego, where the largest population of renters from San Diego to Seattle. That does not have any basic renter protections that we don't have just cause eviction. We do not have rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we want to be a major city. We want to bring the Olympics here. Then let's be a major league city and let's act like the other big. Cities do and treat their renters right, protect their renters. One fifth of our city is living in poverty.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guarantee you those one fifth are renters. We're not doing anything for them. They're not part of this conversation tonight. We had we spent a lot of time tonight not talking about affordable housing, in fact, as very disappointing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We spent a lot of time talking about short term rentals. That's not affordable housing. In fact, we're taking affordable housing units off the market with short term rentals. We're taking apartments off the market for short term rentals. That's not affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're going the wrong way. And if you're not going to put that money into a fund to create affordable housing, then we will stand absolutely opposed to this ordinance. We will stand only for opponents like Santa monica, which says the owner has to be on site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It reduces nuisance, it reduces problems, and it keeps available rental units on the market. We're not going to be a city that has entire apartment buildings gutted so that they can be rented out for Airbnb. 60 days a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Student housing. That's not affordable housing is not affordable housing. It should not be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Discussed as such.'",
        "'speaker_0': '11 1100 units of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Student housing is not affordable housing. To pretend that it is is is dishonest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think we know better than that. Thank you. If you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Want to just complete a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Share. These guys are working overtime. I don't understand why we're in the midst of this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why we aren't getting these folks more resources to get this work done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You tell them to make it a priority. But what are they supposed to do? They just spent six months on the land use element, and only really half the city actually cared about, maybe even less. You got 60%, 60% rents, but they don't have the resources to address it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hear you. Yeah. Thank you for your time. Want. I mean, we went about a minute over. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate it. Thank you.'",
