        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi. My name is Dawn McIntosh. I'm a deputy city attorney. As you see, the city manager is not here tonight, so I'll be teeing this up for you and filling you in on the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The appeal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Before you is somewhat unique from the harbor department, so I'm going to go over the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Process. On January 22nd, 2018, the Board of Harbor Commissioners adopted a resolution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Which certified the Environmental Impact.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report for the Pier be on Dock Rail Support Facility.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They made some associated findings that are required for that certification.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they approved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That project and issued a permit for development of the project. As you know, under the city.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very. The scope of the appeals before you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is quite narrow. The city council's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jurisdiction is limited to a determination of whether the port's environmental review resulting in the final environmental impact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Report was adequate under the California Environmental Quality Act. The City Council conducts a de novo review, which means that you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Judge the facts presented to you and you make your determination on the evidence without deference to this made by the Board of Harbor Commissioners. It's important to remember.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Have 20 minutes to present.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Port staff will begin.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And present the staff report, which will take approximately 10 minutes. After their presentation, the two appellants will have 20 minutes to present their appeals divided among them as they choose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At that time, the port staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Will respond with their rebuttal for the remainder of their 20 minutes. At this point, you may take public comment and then take it behind the rail. After you've received all the evidence, you have two options.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'He is also an attorney with the city attorney's office who handles matters for the harbor department. Behind me is Cathy Jensen of Routan and Tucker. She is an attorney who specializes in environmental matters and has been advising the port for some time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Also behind me is Heather Tom. She's the director of environmental planning. She will be presenting the staff report tonight. And next to her is Matt Armes, who is the assistant director of environmental planning. And with that, Mr. Mayor, I will turn it back over to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. The as far as the additional part of the presentation, will you be doing that? I'm assuming the port staff will be doing that right now. Yes. Okay, then. Then if we can just hear from our harbor staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Honorable Mayor Garcia, members of the city council, the harbor departments before you this evening to respond to two appeals that have been filed against the environmental impact report for the pier be on dock rail support facility project that was recently certified by the Harbor Commission will present a brief staff report describing the project, a summary of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'appeals filed and our responses. Culminating an eight year process where the harbor department responded to over 300 comments on the draft air. Our board held a hearing on January 22nd where they heard presentations, the testimony of 42 public speakers, and they asked numerous questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Harbor Commission found the air to be in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, or SEQUA, and approved the proposed project. The project is located in an industrial area southwest of Anaheim Street and the I-70 ten Freeway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tracks from the facility connect to the iron dock, rail infrastructure in the terminals and trains depart the facility via the Alameda corridor. Rail is the most efficient, economical and least polluting means of moving cargo inland across the country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With the Pier B facility, the port seeks to enhance and expand the existing rail facility at the northern edge of our harbor district. The new facility would provide for longer arrival and departure tracks for today's longer trains. It would increase productivity at our terminals by providing them the ability to build longer trains on dock at their facilities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with more storage and staging tracks. The result will be more efficient on dock rail operations to promote the transport of cargo containers on trains versus transport of cargo containers on trucks. To opt out of rail facilities, the project would also improve motorist and rail safety by eliminating an at grade crossing at the Ninth Street and Pico Avenue'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The on dock rail support facility would be built in three phases over an estimated seven years. Construction of the project would create more than 1100 jobs. The approved project would expand the existing PRB rail facility from 12 tracks to 48 tracks, providing room to stage trains up to 10,000 feet long.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Expanding this rail facility will carry out the goals of the port's master plan and Clean Air Action Plan and will allow more cargo to leave the port complex by rail versus having to go by truck. Currently, about one quarter of the cargo is loaded or unloaded within the port and moved by trains to meet our Clean Air'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Action Plan goals for improving air quality. Our aim is to increase the use of on dock rail to at least 35%. The potential impacts of the project were analyzed appropriately. Per SICA, using all of the relevant methodologies and all feasible mitigation measures were applied.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All potential impacts associated with the project, construction and operation were properly disclosed. Following our board certification of the air. Two appeals were filed to the Long Beach City Council, representing the interests of Phillip Steel Company and superior electrical advertising.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This figure shows the location of Phillips and Superior relative to the project site. The three locations owned by Phillips and the property leased by Superior are all located on Anaheim Street outside of the project footprint to the north.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'None of the properties have been identified for relocation or acquisition. The area where the project is located is zoned industrial, which is specifically slated for heavy industry manufacturing, railyards and port related and maritime industry facilities. The Harbor Department has provided detailed, written responses to each of the grounds for the appeals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll provide a summary of the key issues raised by both appellants. First, Phillips argues that various road closures will negatively affect traffic on Anaheim Street, obstruct access to its businesses and result in traffic delays. The air traffic analysis fully assess the operation of Anaheim Street during the peak construction activity and operations of the project did not identify'",
        "'speaker_2': 'any significant impacts. Phillips Employees and customers will continue to have direct access to each of Phillips facilities. Further, while travel times are not an environmental issue required for analysis and are secure, the estimated travel time delays of approximately 3 minutes are addressed and disclosed in the air.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, the port is committed to work with businesses and contractors to develop a transportation management plan and will minimize impacts to the community and businesses during construction. Superior Electricals Appeal asserts that the air did not address the issue of train dust because this issue was not previously raised by Superior or any other commenter before or during the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'proceedings before the Harbor Commission as required under the Long Beach Municipal Code. This issue may not be appealed to the City Council, and the appeal on this ground should be denied. That said, particulate matter impacts associated with fugitive dust during construction and operation were appropriately analyzed in the air quality section of the air and the project will'",
        "'speaker_2': 'comply with South Coast Air Quality Management District Requirements for dust control. Superior also appeals the determination excuse me, Superior also appeals the determination that the railyard is industrial in nature and that the railyard is compatible with neighboring businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The zoning designation in the vicinity of the project is industrial railyards or expressly permitted uses in the General Industrial District and the port related industrial district where the project is located. Ellipse also contends that the significant air quality impacts identified in the air will negatively affect their employees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The air appropriately analyzed the potential health effects of the project and identified that cancer and non-cancer health impacts from the project would be less than significant. Impacts from nitrogen dioxide would be significant and unavoidable, as was appropriately disco disclosed in the air.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The area where Phillip's properties are located already experience high background levels of snow too, and the project's contribution is small in comparison to the background conditions. Furthermore, the potential and O2 exceedances at Philips locations are expected to be temporary and occur infrequently during construction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next. Phillips claims that the scope of the sequence analysis is inadequate and the IIR provides no plan for acquisition, relocation or compensation for adjacent businesses. The air fully analyzed all of the potential environmental impacts in compliance with Sequa and demonstrates that there is no need to relocate or acquire businesses outside of the project footprint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Phillips also identified a comment letter submitted by Caltrans on the Draft de Air, where they recommended the Ninth Street alternative. The air analyzed potential impacts at numerous street intersections and roadway segments and did not identify any significant impacts associated with ground transportation as it relates to public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The removal of the A-grade crossing at Ninth Street would result in a public safety improvement. Recently, in a letter to the port. Caltrans expressed support for the project and the Harbor Commission certification of this secret document. Caltrans also stated that the objectives of the Pier B project run in parallel with those of the IE 710 corridor and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Shoemaker Bridge projects which overlap with the footprint of this project, especially those objectives which seek to improve efficiency and safety across modes of travel. This letter has been provided in the staff report. Phillips also argues that access to emergency services included at the close, including the closest major hospital, were not sufficiently studied.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While emergency response times are not an environmental issue covered by sequa unless new infrastructure is required. The air did describe the locations of emergency responders, which are located near and on all sides of the project. Fire Chief Terry testified at the board hearing that his department reviewed the project and concluded that there would be no significant impact'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to emergency response capability. Further access routes to the closest hospitals at St Mary Medical Center and Long Beach Memorial would not change as a result of the project. Finally, Phillips states that the air was difficult to follow, should have been recirculated due to a number of changes, and that findings were not supported.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The changes that were made from the draft document to the final were appropriate under sequa and served to reduce the potential impacts associated with the project in response to the comments received. Further, the findings offered 65 pages of detailed, factually supported findings, and the appellant did not specifically identify what changes lacked factual support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neither appellant has identified any flaw in the ER analysis or explained why the board certification of the final air was in error. Therefore, the appeals should be denied this evening as described by the City Attorney's Office and considering the merits of the appeals by Phillips Steel and Superior Electrical City Council as tasked with determining if the Harbor'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Department certification of the final air is in compliance with the requirements of SEQUA. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. With that, we're going to hear from the appellants. So we'll put the clock at 20 minutes total. If I can, please have the appellants. You can feel free to use your time however you would like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can have both. The appellants please come down. And you'll both just use part of the time, I assume? Yes. Okay. Whenever you're ready, sir. Are we good?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Can you please raise your right hand and say I do or I will at the end of the statement to you and each of you solemnly state that the testimony you may give and the calls now in pending before this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do. Good evening, honorable council members and other officials. My name is Darrell Phillips. I'm the proprietor of Phillips Steel Company here in Long Beach, a company that's been here for over 103 years. I'm no attorney. However, I have two general objections to the ports admitting the admitted rubberstamping approval of the C.A.R..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, the proposed plan specifically creates unnecessary burdens for the on a number of local businesses to the point of actual destruction of companies, some of which have been pillars in our community and the city of Long Beach for over 100 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The plan clearly designed to benefit the east side of the city while placing the costs of these benefits on your neighbors to the west side. This is patently unfair. And while the E.R. admits much of this discriminatory treatment, it is deceptive to the point of misleading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In its descriptions. Second, the proposed plan admittedly creates new levels of toxic pollution, health problems and destroys programs within our city that deal with the homeless, mental disorders and residents and others in need. It places the burdens associated with the unfettered expansion on those too poor or too conflicted to capably object.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For these reasons, we ask the City Council to reopen the E.R. and request further findings towards mitigation and impact. More details as to these matters is found in the February 5th, 2018 appeal filed by our company, by our Council on behalf of our company, Philip Steel Company.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here are two purpose specific examples of my points. Just one part of the air admits that the project will materially increase nitrogen dioxide emissions. One of the most toxic emissions known demand short term exposure causes asthma, wheezing, hospital admissions and the E.R. visits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Long term exposure, which will admittedly occur with the port's plan, not only affects physical health of the people, but causes hazy air and nutrient pollution in our oceans. In its response, the report states that increases of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide are, quote, simply unavoidable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The port also concludes that the quote, quote project would also resort result in significant and unavoidable air emissions and health risks impacts on the cumulative impact level, unquote. These admissions occur just before the Port admits that the project will increase greenhouse gases higher than acceptable by the Southern California AQ, M.D..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How can the city knowingly enter into a program designed to generate new and unsafe levels of toxic air and water pollution? Maybe the port has determined this is to be in the best interests of the city and the Treasury.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I can imagine. That the class action lawyers are chomping at the bit. Another victim is the Long Beach Health and Human Services Building, which directly abuts the proposed new rails and my company. I am doubtful it is permitted to object to the project given the inherent conflict of interest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There will be noise, vibration, toxic pollution, interference with school, the homeless and the city's most vulnerable inhabitants. Let's just consider the noise. Noise is measured. Lager. I knew I was going to mess up this word. Lager and mythically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Close enough, for example. Normal conversion. Normal conversation is 60 to 70 decibels. A full blown rock concert is 125 decibels. However, a train horn is 152 decibels, equal to a jet taking off at about 25 meters. At this level.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Eardrums burst. We do not see this addressed anywhere in the air. The port claims that we say now, the port claims that nothing we say now can interfere with its move forward. And none of the points we make are technically violations of sequel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For example, Square requires a ten day notice on the adoption of the final EIA. Did we get 11 days to analyze the thousands of pages before the port hearing? No, we got ten. We were supposed to have 90 days to consider the initial EIA, but the hearing was only 30 days after the last publication notice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So did the port technically technically comply? Perhaps, but it did so in a manner least designed to give notice and least designed to provide time to investigate and respond. We do not believe the City Council must simply. Sit back and allow the poor to hide behind technical defenses while its businesses and most vulnerable residential residents are devastated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by the willful and knowing acts. Therefore. I ask you, please, to postpone your vote here this evening. Come to the west side. Meet us. Meet the people, meet the business owners, hear our concerns, work with us to formulate equitable and workable plans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If your goal is to disrupt the environment. Disrupt and displace businesses and its employees. If your goal is to cut off the West Side emergency services, if your goal is to impose detrimental health risks to your citizens. If your goal is to have a complaint in mandamus, then congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have succeeded. Please postpone your vote. Come meet us. Hear our story. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. And next, we'll have the next speaker in the appellant group. Pablo, do you have the remote? Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Stange Anoka, along with my partner, Jim Sterk. We are the owners of superior electrical advertising. Jim and I have worked together for 49 years, two thirds of my lifetime. So this is an emotional issue for me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I started at the bottom in 1969 after getting out of the out of the U.S. Navy. Worked my way up to management, went to school nights. And when the owner passed away in 1998, Jim and I purchased the company.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We paid $7.1 million for the company. We borrowed. We mortgaged our houses. We did everything we could because we wanted to keep the business in Long Beach because somebody else wanted to buy the company and move it to Orange County.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Superior has 125 employees. Of these 112 125 employees, 43 are Long Beach residents. One third of our workforce are Long Beach residents. I am. I am. I'm a Long Beach resident now. I'm in your district. So when we have an option to hire somebody, if we have equal, you know, equal people we chose, if one lives in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Long Beach, we checked we chose the people, though whoever lives in Long Beach, we worked two shifts. We have employees on site inside and outside our building for 22 hours a day. We do over $25 million a year in signs and we pay a lot of taxes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'According to the air, my back gate is 125 feet from the first rail track. If you turn around and you look at the picture right behind you, that's how far that's how close the trains are going to be to our business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is the wrong project for the west side. Remember, the West Side also includes schools and homes east of the L.A. River. These are these homes and these schools will be affected. We are we had breakfast with Mr. Gonzalez last week, and we're talking about the issues of the of the trains.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there was an issue brought up about the train whistles. Mr. Gonzalez noted that she can hear the train whistles in her downtown home. So I'm wondering how loud will the whistle be at Cesar Chavez School and at Edison School when there are ten blocks closer than the downtown area to those rail yards?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a it's a that L.A. River is not that wide and the tracks are right on the other side of the L.A. River. Let's talk about the west side. The west side industrial area is own I.G. Industrial general.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The I.G. Drift District is intended to promote an industrial area where land is preserved, preserved for industry and protect it from non-industrial uses. A rail yard is not industrial use. There are some 300 businesses on the West Side, 2000 workers, 2000 men and women.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How will they be protected from a 48 yard rail yard? The rail yard does not fall into the IG classification. It's not right for that area. What does a what does a 48 yard rail yard look like? It looks like that that's what 48 tracks looks like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you look at the picture behind us, that's that's 48, that's 44, 45 rows. So it's massive. That's going to be in my back yard. Well, let's talk about Superior. We are in the old Coca-Cola bottling building. I invited everyone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I invited all of you to. To come and meet with us. And the only Lena had breakfast wasn't a talked about it, but she's been to our plant many times, and Al Austin sent his deputy down to to meet with us and see what we do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's hard for you to realize how close and how much the train is going to affect affect us without being there firsthand. And Darrell Phillips was right when he said that you should postpone this and come down and take a look firsthand.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a 50,000 square foot manufacturing plant and a 50,000 square foot open yard. We work in the open yard and store finish lines in the yard. We manufacture high end signage. Here we are. What are the most expensive flying companies on the West Coast?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At any time there can be a half a million dollars worth of product finished science sitting in our yard ready to install. Our clients are businesses like McDonald's, Starbucks, CBS, Disney, Universal, Dunkin Donuts, The Giant, don't it, on Seventh Street and PCH for Dunkin Donuts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did that, don't it? The the sign you see in front of the Performing Arts Center facing facing Ocean Boulevard. We did that sign, Gladstone's, the Pike Parking Structure. Our signs are in every district in Long Beach and not only in Long Beach, but across the country.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm just wondering how we can do business, you know, a stone's throw from our backyard. We're going to have whistles blowing all day long, screeching train wheels, metal on metal, coupling and uncoupling all day long. Especially the crushing sound coupling makes air pollution that wouldn't include dust that will affect the product we have in our yard'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And Blythe, tell me how we do, how we entertain clients, clients, many of them looking at finished products in our back yard. How do we protect our products? Signs that are 100,000, $200,000 signs? You know, you can spend an hour and air anywhere you want.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nobody writes or presents a bad idea. According to the air, the port plans to use electric trains in the rail yard, but diesel locomotives will be used to pick up the 10,000 foot long trains. Not one diesel, but four or five diesels, maybe more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I learned yesterday that what's going to happen is that there will be two diesels in the front and two diesels in the rear. That means that diesel engines will have to come from the Wilmington area all the way across the rail yard to the east side, where they will get to that will where they will get on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the back of a 10,000 foot train and push the train. So these diesels are going to travel through our backyard. The Earth states that this rail yard meets all Section eight UMD guidelines. But read a couple of lines in the air on page 11 dash tool for the four areas of environmental concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Noise, vibration, air quality and transportation have been thoroughly evaluated in the draft. EIA only air quality impacts have been determined to be significant. On page 11, Dash 212, after considerable analysis determined there will be less than to say that these will be less than significant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The only exception being air quality impacts, which were determined to be significantly adverse. So air quality will be significantly adverse. If I stay here 125 feet for the rail yard, I will be subjecting my employees to noise and significantly adverse air quality.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first time one of my employees has a breathing issue. I smell a lawsuit. So what can Superior do? Not much. We can close our doors. After 62 years, we can. We can just shut our doors down to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can move. But moving a company of our size is probably more expensive than we can afford. And move. Where? How do we find a 50,000 square foot building with a 50,000 square foot open yard, which we need?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are no properties in Long Beach that are available at beginning of this presentation. I said it's an emotional issue for me. It's an emotional issue for my partner, too. We've been working together for nearly 50 years and we have many employees that have been there for 20 years, 30 years, and we have our two sons there'",
        "'speaker_4': ', my son and my partner's son. They've been with us for over 25 years. Our legacy was to leave the company to our sons one day. Well, that may not happen, you know, or if it does happen, it's going to be very difficult.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Approving the railyard in its present format is the wrong decision for the West Side. Because we do not fall in the footprint of the rail yard. The Port of Long Beach position is that we are not directly impacted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Important words directly impacted. I strongly disagree that 125 feet from that yard is directly impacted. The port of Long Beach and the city of Long Beach will be changing the lives of many people. There are studies done by many universities across the country on rail yards, and they all conclude residents and employees near rail yards are expected'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to suffer asthma, cardiac disease, cancer, premature, premature death and at a higher rate than someone who lives four miles from a rail yard. You can see the trains, but you can't see the air pollution. The rail yard is wrong for superior.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'They came down to our facility. Not the first time. We've met one couple of times. We've met up with them at their office. And, you know, I think the port can see that the up the property south of Anaheim Street between Anaheim and 12th Street are in a zone and everybody in that zone is affected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everybody in that zone is going to lose business. They're going to be hurt. They're going to be sick. They're just too close to that property. A 12 foot buffer is not enough. So I think you just need to really think of what you're doing to a half a dozen businesses that are in that limbo area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. And we're going to go ahead and go back to the hearing order. And we do have now an opportunity for rebuttal from staff. So please.'",

The Environmental Impact Report Process, the development of the process for this project has been going on for eight years, and it's been a process that we've taken very seriously.

When the draft document was released, we extended that comment period to 90 days and we held three public hearings as opposed to the one that's required.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also had the public hearing with our board when they certified the document and we had the documentation out under that, the required times for that. We feel that we've had a very robust process. We've had numerous meetings with the appellants that have presented before you today as well, and we will continue to work with them to'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Project area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those impacts will occur during construction and operation. Looking specifically at the locations for the appellants for Philips, there was a receptor that we used for the modeling that identified that the impacts will be infrequent during the construction process and and that the majority of the impacts to NOx are actually coming from the background conditions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the project contribution adds about a quarter of the the impacts that are seen at that site. But the 75% of the impacts are actually from the background conditions. There were no significant impacts identified from no noise and vibration associated with the project and also for the traffic evaluation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There were no significant traffic impacts from the project and. All of the appropriate sensitive receptors. We did look at residences. We did look at schools for both noise and air quality analyzes, and there all of the potential impacts to sensitive receptors.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Instead, they are referring to disclosures that were made in the air. There was a reference to there only being 30 days from the closure of the comment period to the approval of the project. That is incorrect. The comment period closed on March 13, 2017, and the hearing before the board was not until January 12, 2018.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's the only other issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At this time, I'd also like to conclude with comments from our executive director, Mario Cordero.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And members of the City Council. The Pier B on dock rail support. The City project. It was an essential component to the port's mission of being the green port of the future and furthering our commitment to sustainable development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you may know, in 2017, the port had its best year, moving 7.5 million containers. Best. In our 107 year history. The Pier B project not only enhances efficient movement of container cargo. But also in addition mitigates potential roadway congestion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And clearly and I will say again and clearly a less polluting freight transport system. You have heard commentary on both sides and both sides admit there's been a lot of dialog. There has been meetings. The port has never been dismissive of the concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we will continue to commit to engage with our stakeholders and engage with those impacted, whether directly or indirectly. And thus, I would respectfully request that the Council confirm and affirm the certification of the final Environment Environmental Impact Report for their Pier B on Dock Rail Facility Project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Kudo. I appreciate that. We're going to go into public comments. And Madam Clerk, do we need to do an oath for anyone that is going to make public comment and city attorney?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It will obliterate small businesses on the west side of Long Beach, isolate its inhabitants and limit routes to downtown, thus decreasing access to restaurants, shopping, parks, meeting places and other vital resources, all of which will impact downtown businesses, residents and employees.'",

I'm Tiffany Rao, director of government public affairs for Endeavor, speaking on behalf of our terminal and pipeline operator and the Port Tesoro SoCal Pipeline Company, LLC.

We are committed to working with the port to resolve our concerns that construction of the project could require removal and or relocation of over 200 utility pipelines, including over 75 oil pipelines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Removal of hundreds of utility lines could result in significant disruption of the port's operations. And these disruptions would also directly affect our operations, our customers, public utilities and numerous other operators at the port. The impacts will disproportionate disproportionately burden to Thora.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'We have identified a solution that could significantly reduce these potential impacts, minimize disruption and limit unnecessary construction costs by allowing active pipelines to be protected and abandoned in place and safely abandoned. Inactive pipelines using accepted best practices and abandonment activities are strictly regulated by the U.S., D.O.T. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the California State Fire'",

Happy Nowruz. Council Members Price. I want to also thank the Council, particularly the Mayor and Councilman Nine and Councilwoman Price for your efforts to keep open community hospital of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would say on this the Carpenters strongly support the Pier B project, but I want to remind you what your mission is here tonight. Your charge, it's to deal with the certification of the air so it's not on the substance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So much was discussed on the process and on the process. There's been no evidence tonight that the city failed to comply with the requirements under SEQUA. In fact, they gave additional time, as your deputy city attorney reported, for people to come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in fact, tonight we heard an admission that there was sufficient time by one of the appellants, but not one fact was ever presented that they were unable to produce in that timely manner to justify an extension of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that the city has the staff has has put it forward. And I think particularly the last item, the deputy city attorney said that 75% of the negative impacts, some of the stuff that was highlighted in one of the appellant's comments in paper is already there in the background.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We think on the on the balance, this is a great project. It's not going to mean a lot of jobs for Southwest Carpenters. It will mean some. But for the over 2000 carpenters members and family members who live in the city of Long Beach, it means that this port will continue to be competitive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You've got people in Savannah, you've got people in Canada who want to take this business. This is the engine that drives the city council members. And this project will do two things. It will increase the velocity of moving those those goods, which makes us more competitive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But second, in the keynote for this city is that it's going to do it in a green way, reduce the pollution. That's what makes Long Beach unique. With all the ports, you're the greenest port in the country. Let's keep it that way.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'A large benefit as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well. But the most important part is the key infrastructure. That's for improvements for the dock, which will keep it competitive. We support this primarily because of the play components that do encourage local hires not only for veterans but disadvantaged workers as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It aids in alleviating congestion in our local highways and streets, alleviating a lot of our membership, having to drive out to larger areas of the greater Los Angeles area. We fully support this project and the ability to provide good middle class wages for our membership and others that would benefit directly from the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In conclusion, we ask that you deny the appeal, as well as urge the full council support in bringing the project forward. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",

We believe any time the ports can do projects of this magnitude that make everything more efficient for us, that's also a reduction in emissions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any time you can have operations that clearly cut down on drainage, that moves. I have the near dock facility, you pitas and that's a four mile facility. And when you have facilities on dock that don't have rail service, this would provide for some of those smaller, smaller moves to all be connected into one train.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do want to tell you that the previous speaker mentioned about how we accommodate for the engines on a train. A lot of what is happening in terms of that's called distributed power. And what happens is that actually makes the train run more efficient and use less fuel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even though you see those locomotives, the head locomotive is the one managing that train and it can really help a lot with efficiency in terms of reduction of fuel use. And that's something that's always very important to us.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And the project. Construction will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Create much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Needed jobs in the community. This project will improve efficiency.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks so much, nick speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and City Councilmembers. My name is Kendall Asuncion, and I'm here on the left on behalf of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. We are here to express our support for the air for the Port of Long Beach Pier beyond our rail facilities, as needed to move more cargo on dock, which will both'",
        "'speaker_1': 'improve efficiency and reduce pollution. The improvements will increase track space to connect smaller train segments and connect the cargo terminals, enhancing the system and increasing rail use, which will eliminate truck trips and congestion at the ports and throughout the region.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pier B on dock rail facilities will leverage the port's existing investments in rail, which will continue to have positive ripple effects to the community, including improved air quality, reduce poverty, reduce pollution, decrease congestion and construction, which will generate new jobs in the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will also play a key role in meeting the near-term goal of moving 35% of containers via undock rail. Given these useful benefits, the Chamber urges the Council to uphold approval of the EIA for the by the Harbor Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you and have a good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and City Council members. My name is Paige Polonius and I am here to speak on behalf of Assemblymember O'Donnell's strong support for the Pier B Project. Pier B expansion will reduce harmful emissions, reduce truck traffic congestion and increase port efficiency.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To put it simply, this project will help the port become greener.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Leaner and more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Competitive. For these reasons, Assemblymember O'Donnell is in strong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Support of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Nick. Speaker, please. My name is Paul Collins. I'm an architect in Long Beach in the West Side. I'm here representing the West Side Project Area Committee. We are firmly right now behind the port as far as we want the port to expand and we always try to be on the port side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the pollution aspect of this has not been looked at carefully at all when I read through the air. And all the items that were checked that there was no significant impact. They weren't certainly talking about the industrial area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The only industrial area where heavy industrial can occur in Long Beach is in the West Side, and the pollution for us is going to be much greater than it is now. Already within a mile of the port, we have cancer rates and asthma rates up to 800% higher than any other part of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the trains are going to indefinitely produce more pollution for us. The trains that leave the port, they go through and they and they go long term. Those were not part of the port's environmental impact study. Those trains are a different type of train, and the port cannot control the people that own those trains and tracks on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what kind of engines they burn. We've had we've taken pictures of these trains leaving long term and they have black soot coming out of them and they produce as much, if not more pollution than the trucks would. The businesses in the West Side have had good access for the city and for the to the city and to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the port, and that's going to all be cut off. So all the businesses that require access to the port to get their items that they build in West Long Beach out of the port are not going to have the same access that they have now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And some of them have heavy loads and large loads. That hasn't been considered at all because they go up Santa Fe right now and Santa Fe is going to be closed off. And that does not work for several of the larger companies that have many jobs and have many people working for them that won't be able to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get their items to the port to get them out of the country. Thank you very much, sir. Good evening, Mayor Garcia Garcia and council members. I'm keep this short. I'm a professional carpenter and I lived in the West Long Beach area all my life.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I live two miles away from the project and I am for Pier B project. So I agree. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even Mayor Garcia and council members. And thank you for this time and opportunity. My name is Ted Humanas and I'm a representative with the Southwest Regional Council of the Carpenters. And what I have with me today is carpenters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Stand up, building trades, stand up. These are people here a few and quite a few are outside. And we're here to let you know that we support the project. I'm sure you heard all the details. I'm not going to be redundant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is about hard work that's going to provide a lot of construction jobs. We're about a middle class living, health care pension with dignity. And whenever that opportunity is available, like you're offering here, we're strong supporters that we represent over 50,000 carpenters just in the southwest, 30,000 carpenters plus here in Southern California, along with the building trades'",
        "'speaker_5': '. We urge you to support this project. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mayor and city council members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm an employee of a heavy industrial.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Manufacturing company.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In West Side, Long Beach. My understanding is the whole thing of tonight is just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Questioning her.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'About the environmental impacts are not good publicity. I was just wondering about the vibration impact because that has.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A direct impact on precision manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the train just in and of itself has an impact. And I don't think that that came up. Definitely things you can do about it. Right. But I don't think that that was brought up in the environmental report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So maybe that's something to look at. As well as the inevitable rerouting of the heavyweight corridor and the associated environmental impact as a current project directly impacts the heavyweight corridor. So I guess the question would be we need to kind of assess how it was evaluated and take a closer look because there's there are things we can'",
        "'speaker_6': 'do about the impact. Just we need to know what the impact is accurately. Right. But fair consideration, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks so much. Next speaker, please. Thank you, Mayor. City Council. My name is Lee Wilson. I own a piece of property at 1520 West 11th Street that is right underneath the railyard. The building will disappear. We've owned that property since 1965.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have a tenant down there today doing some very crucial work not only for this port, but for the country on some of the specialized handling that he does. He has no idea the future of his business. But I'm not here to speak against the air.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to address the fact that and request that council postpone their approval of this tonight until they can convene a meeting and another hearing to where probably the dozen or two dozen people that were outside that have not been able to get in have left out of frustration.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because when I got here about 20 minutes before, there was a 100 yard line, long line, and it just grew and grew. If I had not been forceful at the door with the police department, I would not be in here myself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to thank I did talk to Mario and I talked to Rick camera. And I know Rick went out and got the fire marshal to go out, try to get people in. My buddy Larry here and other impacted business is here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I don't think that the pop, you know, the people being impacted that have skin in the game had adequate time to address the council and raise their issues. I, I can thank the port and I am totally positive that they follow every rule in Sitka.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm very familiar with the square and the processing, but I think the council as a whole has left the stakeholders down, not allowing enough of them into the meeting to hear the appellants. I only got to hear Superior did not hear the Phillips Company, which I missed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, Mr. Mayor Garcia and council members. My name is Lawrence Mihara and I'm with 435 Seafood, Long Beach Sportfishing, Queen's Wharf Restaurant in the Port of Long Beach. And I want to talk about my opposition to the approval of the air in the air, or the response states that our business is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not significantly impacted yet. In the first paragraph in black and white in the report, the project eliminates 53 parking spots. We already are unable to accommodate our customers with sufficient parking spaces, particularly on the weekends. There are no overflow lots and no alternatives for parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To state that reducing our parking lot by approximately 25% is not significant is to ignore the facts and nature of our business located there, which are popular with the community. This is one of the only places in the port where local community has access to the port.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The response states that no building will be affected. But just I just learned in a meeting with the port design team that Pico Boulevard, essentially a multiple lane highway, will be 12 feet from my from the corner of my building to state that no building will be affected also ignores reality.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I also want to talk about the air quality will be adversely affected for our employees and customers. The report admits that the air quality is significantly worse as a result of the nitrous oxide levels that are beyond the federal threshold levels.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And yet it says this is not a significant fact. It defies common sense to say that doubling the number of rail tracks and trains and having tracks and road 50 feet closer to our business will not significantly increase pollution and affect our business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our restaurant is mostly outdoors with people sitting outside. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. And it looks like we're nearing the end of the speaker's list. So we will be our last speakers that are here in line for this hearing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Members of the City Council. My name is when I was meeting with the Regional Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. We're here to support business development. We support the Hispanic business community as well. We're here in favor of the Pier B on dock project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're here because we support the jobs that it will generate. Trade through the port sustains about 300,000 jobs in the Southern California region. 30,000 of those jobs are in Long Beach. This project alone will be over about 1100 jobs, that it'll create it a lot more at the port to move more cargo more efficiently, generate more opportunities'",
        "'speaker_8': 'while maintaining low emissions, reducing traffic as well. The chamber supports the project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Port. Port. I remember I adjudicate on employment law and some of the people, the attorneys who were called that office won it and adjudication determination in their favor simply because they were attorneys. Never mind that they were defrauding the people who were fired.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I heard this, and I'm sitting there with no real particular interest, and then my mind just skirted back to the airport argument. How beneficial it would have been financially, how the international community would have had access to Long Beach wanting to bring the Olympics here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you got the aquarium that put this of the Pacific that you just gave $53 million to do. And the jobs that would have been created long term had you brought in International Airport to Long Beach. Why didn't you do it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You didn't do it because your rich clients didn't want it. That's why you didn't do it. They wouldn't have voted for you again, some of you, if you had brought that international airport that, you know, would have been of large global impact to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would have brought put Long Beach on the map like none other. But you voted no. Why did you do it? And now you're willing to say yes to this? Hypocrisy is terrible. The souls of men are being bought and sold here because the poorest of the community of Long Beach live there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you don't care about it. Even though you're going to have jobs, you're going to have an international influence. But you said no to an international airport. You have a tunnel. The airport. You don't have a big boy airport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And why not?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you. And we love our we love our airport as it is. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Grady Mayor, the city council. My name is Tony Rivera. Most of you know me already. I was former chair of RTA on the West Side. And I will I will tell you to everyone, this project, I am not opposed to this project, but it's been done incorrectly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When we were talking about a long time ago, we were talking about Unite Long Beach, not divide it. Now Long Beach. The problem is decided to divide us. Put a rail wall in there so we don't go to the port.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Number one problem. Number two, problem. They just said that we're going to have a clean, local motors for the neighborhood. I got burials right now with the locomotives coming in and contaminate all the west and downtown Long Beach with all this smog.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's not been taking care of it. So that's the second thing is bad. The third one is that the ships are coming in 40 miles. They come in slow, but everybody's talking about trucks and trucks leaving the trucks alone.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They already clean, concentrate on the ships 40 miles, even 100 miles up in the air. All the contamination comes to downtown and you can go see my yard on Sundays. How black it is for that smoke when the ships and the rail.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, I'm going to tell you this. We need to work together and we I will ask you to send it back to the public, have some hearings. The port knows they need to go back and do the engineering at work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We cannot screw American people over international trade. You guys are elected by American people, not by the we're all agents and everybody. And and I would make a little point in here. And, you know, we always get unions from other cities to come in and support these projects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We live in lobbies. I spent 18 hours for the last 40 years alone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that concludes the public comment part of the hearing. We're going to go and close public comment and come back to the council for deliberation. So let me begin with Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Thank you, everybody, for being here tonight. I know that you have been through many different meetings, and so I will speak very shortly as you have. And we appreciate your time here. I want to thank everyone, particularly Darryl Phillips and Stan, to Nokia, as well as the West Side industrial area businesses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They have I've met with them about five or six different times over the last year, both my staff and myself. I've also worked very closely with our first district former first District Council member and Port Commissioner, Bonnie Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We actually deci each other yesterday and chatted about this as well. And I want to thank our harbor commissioners as well as our harbor staff Rick, Samantha, Nina, Heather, Matthew, as well as our president, Mario Cordero. I've connected with everybody to make sure that we're getting this just right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as you've heard here, you know, Phillip steal superior signs. I think the average time that the West Siders have been in business and invested out there has been probably it's the average is probably 60 years or so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those businesses are historic. So of course, we we care very much about them. And although we know that this is going to be a good project, we have to be very mindful of this business community. And just to be clear as well, the city council is only making a determination on the appeal of the art in the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'segment analysis. So I have a few questions for staff. And really they're just two main concerns. And I know that they don't specifically speak to the air, but I feel like they have to be addressed. And I thank you for addressing this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So first, as it relates to access, as the 12 ST option was formally adopted by the Harbor Harbor Commission, it will remove access to Ninth Street. Do we have any other access options that we believe will be more beneficial for our Westside community other than Ninth Street?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. ACCESS Well, this shoemaker Brant ramps when they are removed can still occur through Anaheim Street and down one of the Archer arterials or via the 710.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And I just want to make crystal clear as well, as you mentioned in the as far as the public safety access, there will be no issues with public safety going to and from the west side to attend to any emergency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. We have worked extensively with the fire department and other emergency services. They've done their own analysis about access and response times. There are no significant impacts or concerns with emergency service access. In addition, we've evaluated the routes to get to the nearest hospitals, and those routes will not be impacted as a result of this project'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Great. Thank you. And then the second question is related to our businesses. Of course, as we've said here, and I want to emphasize how how many businesses do we have that not just the parcels, but businesses that will be directly impacted, either directly or indirectly, like Phillip Steel and Superior Science?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do you know how many actual businesses?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So at this point, we can give estimates until the air was fully certified. We were limited in the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Amount of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Work we could do on the business relocation and survey side. But we believe that there's approximately 40 businesses that would be impacted in the project footprint.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, so 40 businesses. And after this decision tonight, should we move forward with staff's recommendations? How will we identify a strong business retention and relocation plan for these businesses both directly and indirectly impacted, whether it's receiving mitigations for noise and air just in general, and also finding alternative options in our city for these particular businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The port staff has already been establishing a project team to evaluate all of these issues, to work with the affected businesses, to work with the community. We've already been addressing questions and responding to the comments and questions that have come up through the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've also been reaching out to the other city departments like Development Services and Economic Development, and we will be continuing those discussions and looking for ways that we can relocate all of these businesses within the city of Long Beach and close to their to their current location.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we commit to continuing to work through that process and to make sure that we're listening to all the concerns and addressing those concerns as we go through the design and construction process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And that was my next question. Have we worked with the Economic Development Department? You said we have. That's fantastic. So these businesses are fully aware of their options. And as the project moves forward, what is the timeline for the project?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I understand this could be, of course, done in phases. Do we have something coming up, a milestone that we can hit and we can report out to, say, the Harbor and Tidelands Committee?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would be happy to report out to the Harbors and Tidelands Committee. I think in general, the the initial priorities are for us to start working on developing further development of the design. We'll need to go through a process for the evaluation of the properties that will be affected for the acquisition of those properties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that will be a long term process. We'll also be moving forward with the ninth Street closure, which will be a early priority for the project as well. That's likely to take place in the next year or two to the acquisition process will likely be over about a five year period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we'll also be doing some of the initial efforts for the utility relocation, which will also need to take place in the early phase of the project. So a lot of that work will take place over the next approximately five years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. So as we hit those milestones prior to ninth Street closing, which seems to be a fast tracked, you know, priority, I would just ask that we report this information out to the Harbor and Highlands Committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm the chair. Councilmember Price and Pearce are both on the committee with me to ensure that our businesses are fully aware of what comes next and our residents are fully aware of what will happen next. And you need to just specifically notice them as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we're working either with my office or I know you're very you're well acquainted with our West Side industrial area, but for any other residents that might want to have this information and and be privy to it so they understand what exactly is going on with the project, I would just ask that we we do that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the last question I have here, will will there be mitigation and will it provide funding for the West Side livability plan for both residents and business stakeholders? This was the Westside Livability Plan that was a multi year process for communities and business stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They came together, they talked about many projects for lessening mitigations due to air pollution, noise, etc. So this can this be folded into to this project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this project does have a contribution to our community grants program between the air quality and the greenhouse gas impacts associated with this project, there will be an approximately $1.5 million contribution to that fund. As a reminder, several years ago, our board established an overall program that will be providing over $46 million in funding through the Community'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mitigation Program. So this this project will make a contribution to that program. Part of the reason why the Port of Long Beach worked with the city and development of the Livability Westside Livability Plan, initially we provided some. Funding to help support the development of that plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was that so that we could get a better understanding of the priorities for the projects that could be done to help address those concerns in in West Long Beach and to help us line up how we could prioritize some of the funding through our program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we look forward to continuing to coordinate with the city on those priorities and how those funds can help to address some of those projects. We will continue to work with the community as well each year as we go through developing the funding priorities for that program going forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we look forward to continuing to support that project. And as a reminder, this project will make a contribution to help further that program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. I just want to make sure that was addressed. And I will just say let's just continue to keep connected to make sure that that was saved. Livability Plan sees fruition for the community. I know it's a big deal for them as well as businesses, residents, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so do we know what the community process will be in terms of that? Is that coming back at a certain time?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's it should pass, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So each year it's an ongoing program. Now, that was part of the board's approval a few years ago is so that we could establish an ongoing program. So each year we go through a process of having community meetings where we seek input from the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also meet regularly with city department staff to find out about priority projects. So we go through a process approximately around the fall each year to gather input on funding priorities for the upcoming year. We make a presentation to our Harbor Commission in the early part of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We made a presentation in February of this year identifying the priorities that were shared by the community and the city staff. During those meetings, we made a recommendation for this upcoming funding cycle to focus on stormwater projects, and so we'll be releasing a request for proposals later this spring for approximately $3 million to fund projects that can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'improve stormwater infrastructure in the in the city in that area. But each year we go through a process last year that the funding was provided for air filters and community health programs. But each year we go through a process to seek input from the community about those priorities, and then we release a new funding cycle each year'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So that will be an ongoing process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, great. Thank you. And I will just ask, with that said, to make sure that we are connected. The council offices are connected. I know some of the meetings had been occurring on a Tuesday, which was a council Tuesday, and I would just really urge that we all just stay connected to make sure that the community is'",
        "'speaker_9': 'fully aware of what is happening at every step of the way. And I know that will do that. But we appreciate you answering those questions. So thank you very much. I will move that we review and I'm sorry we should receive and file all documentation of the record concerning the two concerning the two appeals and adopt the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city staff recommendation and uphold the Board of Harbor Commissioners certification of the final air. I just want to say again, thank you very much to the Westside Industrial Area for coming out. I know this is very difficult. It's very difficult to deal with this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I get that. But I urge you to just stay involved with our office. We've been connected with you. We will remain connected with you. We will make sure that you do not lose sight of what this project will mean and entail.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we will ensure that everyone is privy to the information, both residents and businesses. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So just to be clear, also, that's a motion on the floor then to approve the staff recommendation on the on the air and deny the appeal. And with that, the second on the motion, Councilmember Janine Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Plus everybody in the room that's been coughing and sneezing. I want to thank first of all, I want to thank the appellants for being involved in this process, for advocating on your business's behalf, on your neighborhood's behalf. I know that a decision like this is scary and emotional because it is your livelihood that you have been building'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on and working on for a long time. And so I just want to thank you guys. I want to thank all the staff at the port, our commissioners, the staff at the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It speaks volumes to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That we had as many people here and support and a small handful of those that that spoke with some concern, somebody who's watched issues of the port for the last decade. I know that this always is a rare occasion to have so many people in support of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I did reach out to my environmental.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Activist.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Organizations and nonprofits and tried to get their take on this policy on this earth as well. And so I'm happy to be able to support my council colleagues.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And to me, as somebody who takes that freeway almost every day and knows what the fight has been to try to clean up our air, really having a conversation around when the impacts are. And so my my first question is really when we talk about the air quality issues, I believe it was stated that a lot of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those come from building out PRB and not so much that it's extremely long term. There are long term effects, but how much of of the the air pollution is caused from just.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Building the projects?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The air analyzed both impacts from the construction of the project over the seven year period through the three phases, in addition to the operational impacts associated with the the trains that will be operating in the facility for the for Philip Steel specifically and their response to comment that they had when we looked at the impacts at the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nearest receptor to their location, the impacts were the significant impacts were limited to the construction phase of the project. But there were areas around the project that did experience both construction phase impacts and operational phase impacts for nitrogen oxide specifically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then this is just an idea I had off the top of my head, so forgive me, but I know that there were the bonnets that were created for ships. Is there anything like that in the works for trains.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To help reduce some of the pollution that comes from them?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there is a project that the the two ports established a technology advancement program many years ago. Over a decade ago. One of the recently funded projects that we're working on is with a technology developer called Vir Rail, and they have developed a near zero emission locomotive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So these are cleaner than the cleanest locomotive standards that are out there. These these have extremely low nitrogen oxide emissions. And so we've provided funding for the development of that switcher locomotive. But then recently through a grant from the California Air Resources Board, we're going to be able to replace the onboard generator in that locomotive with batteries'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that the the locomotive can operate using zero emission track miles. So that's a project that we're developing right now, working with our operator, Pacific Harbor Line, who's been a great partner with us on demonstrating different technologies over the years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're hopeful that that technology will be effective and then we can look at future opportunities to get more of them integrated into the operations. Currently, Pacific Harbor Line is the cleanest switcher operate switcher locomotive operator in the country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They've done a lot of work over the years to upgrade their locomotives and they're currently testing out a Tier four locomotive. Great. So when we we talk about the air, it does not include that plan, right? It's based on what we have in place today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is correct. We used a conservative analysis based off of what we have today, but we're hopeful that we can reduce emissions even further in the future. That's great. I think that speaks volumes again. And this is a question around the workforce piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had some conversation around local residents. This project falls in line with the project labor agreement that also has a local higher percentage. Is that correct? This project is included in the project labor agreement. Great. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know again, operations at our ports having multiple layers and tiers of where we're doing that work is really a big challenge to please everybody. And I think that you guys have done a fantastic job. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Next speaker is Vice Mayor Richardson.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson, for the permit. I want to thank my councilmembers. GONZALEZ It appears they touched a lot on the issues that I had obviously been the representative of the West Side. You know, we're talking about the West, the Westside Livability Study.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're talking about the trains. We're talking about taking off cargo on dark rail and away from freeways that would take 750 trucks out of the freeways.

        "'speaker_7': 'of the project would have in the short term, I think are outweighed by the benefits in the long term, when we're looking at taking container traffic out of the freeway out of the 710 and the issues that we deal with it with it there also the fact that in addition to having more on dock rail facilities, this'",
        "'speaker_7': 'was an issue that has been taking place for many years. And in fact, when I joined the city council four years ago, that was a big issue of debate in terms of whether the candidates at that time were in favor of undock.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Rail And of course, I was, and here we are. Here's the opportunity now to move this proposal forward. It's a part of a process. Obviously, it starts with CEQA and then the engineering work takes place to make it happen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm very pleased with staff and their support and their work in getting this done. I think that they've done it with the sensitivity to the neighborhood's impact in terms of the impact to the West Palm Beach community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I, I think that it's a job well done. And I again, want to thank my councilmembers for their for their support of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. So I support this project. And I want to thank both the appellants and city staff who provided the presentation this evening. As the chair of the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority. I'm a big supporter of anything that we can do to stay ahead of the changing industry that we have in terms of goods, movement'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and on dock rail provides us an opportunity to do that. It allows us to stay competitive and really look to the future in terms of the way we're moving goods both locally, regionally and throughout the nation. And so I support everything that's being done in regards to this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's going to be a great model and it's going to allow Long Beach to, in practice, do what it always preaches, which is to be a zero emissions port move towards a zero emissions port. I'm grateful that it includes the play and I'm also thankful for the comments of my colleagues to try to mitigate the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'issues for the immediate neighbors. I think that obviously is an ongoing concern and something that should be addressed along the way. So I think everyone for being here tonight and I wholeheartedly support this this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Base me, Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I want to just give some kudos to the work that the port did. It's not often and I think Councilmember Gonzalez or Jeanine. Councilman Pearce mentioned it's not often that you see no environmental group opposing infrastructure investment at the port and you see a lot of positive comments here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, so good. Good work there and sort of doing the outreach. And it appears that you've you've done a lot of work to be sensitive to those adjacent businesses and neighborhoods. On dog rail is smart for a lot of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's the standard we encourage it across the country gets, you know, trucks off the trucks off the street. It cleans up your your air and it creates a more efficient system. And then infrastructure investment in general supports job creation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so obviously support infrastructure investment. Three things I want to note. So I recognize that conversation on the West Side about the Shoemaker Bridge up in North Long Beach. We have an area of town that's sort of cut off by the 17th is kind of the Coolidge Triangle Longwood area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as infrastructure is modernized, we try to find ways to stitch communities back together. So I just want to say, if there are, you know, just ask if there are any conversations about mobility plans or seventh and or anything else to make sure that we're thinking about stitching communities back together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The port staff, our transportation planning and engineering staff have been coordinating with City Public Works as well as Metro and Caltrans on their work on the I 710 project and the early action projects that will affect the Shoemaker Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we'll be. Making sure to continue those discussions, continue that coordination, and making sure that we're developing circulation and traffic management plans that accommodate access through that area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And secondly, I want to recognize and thank you for the conversation about engaging economic development and development services, about thinking about ways to retain businesses here. I just want to just sort of just put it out there that if ever there is some displacement of a business, we should think about, you know, opportunities to clean up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'other industrial spaces and create economic activity there. For example, the gentleman who spoke about his sign saying business, I would love to have this same business in North Palm Beach if if the opportunity was was there. So there are other other industrial spaces that could use more economic activity to sort of raise the standard in some of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those areas. So I just wanted to sort of put that on the table. And then the last thing I would say, I would encourage you or rather our frame it as a question, is there an opportunity to continue to to to work to find a solution with the utilities?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The conversations brought up about the utilities and the pipelines. Is there an opportunity to continue working to find a resolution there?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. And we have had some initial discussions with all of the affected parties for the utility relocation work that will be necessary for this project. Once we move through the air certification process and can start the design phase, that's where we'll move forward with those discussions in earnest and make sure that we're working with all the affected'",
        "'speaker_2': 'stakeholders to make sure that we're accommodating those needs as we develop the final design.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fantastic. Well, you have a good project here and I'm happy to support it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. There's a motion and a second, of course, that's been made. I just got a couple of brief comments. We all know, of course, that the actual vote tonight is a narrow one for the council from from the scope of the actual vote itself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I do want to make just a couple of comments just for the public at large, I think are important. And the first is, I know there was some concern about pollution or impacts of the project. I just think it's important to note that long term, the actual benefit of on dock rail and the actual benefit of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'implementing the full cleaner action plan will dramatically reduce pollution in and around the ports and up, up and down the 710 corridor. And so from an infrastructure creation perspective, this project at Pier B and and the expansion of our rail capacity is critical to the to the clean air future that we all want to have in this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'community. So I do want to commend the Board of Harbor Commissioners for, I know the incredible amount of work that went into getting us to this point. Pier B and the conversations around Pier B have been going on for many years, and there were many decisions that led up to getting to this process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's critical that we expand rail. The only way that we ensure that Long Beach as a port remain competitive across the world is to expand rail. It is a critical piece of the future. And there were some comments about, you know, being global or being local.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to be clear that the port provides 30,000 local jobs to people in and around the port area. And so we are talking about local issues. And I want to think there are many workers that are here, both carpenters and electricians and others that are local, live in Long Beach and that live in the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'area. And so this idea that somehow they're not local, I take offense to I also add that it's as important that we are working with our businesses. And I do. I well, I want to thank Councilman Gonzalez for I know having met multiple times with with these businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I also I'm confident I look to our harbor commissioners. I know that Vice President Askew and Commissioner Lowenthal are both here. And I ask you, as I know on behalf of the council, I know that you will ensure that our our port team continue to work with the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know, Commissioner Lowenthal, how much you have worked with these businesses in the past and when you were here. And so just to those that came forward, I think we hear you and you have our commitment that we're going to do everything we can to mitigate these impacts to to meet with you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know our port team are going to do just that. And so, again, I want to thank Tom Lee and the entire Mr. Cameron, the entire environmental team. Mr. Cordero, your your senior staff getting here has been a long and long process, but an important one to make this to make the air cleaner and to move'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and members of the City Council. The project before you is a request for approval of a light industrial project at the site of the former U.S. Postal Service processing and distribution center at 2300 Redondo Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The there's an aerial on the on the screen. You can see that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Building that's currently on the site is a 326,000 square foot processing and distribution center that's been used by the U.S. Postal Service. This facility is now closed and it was part of the Postal Service's system wide restructuring process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so subsequent to the closure, the property was deeded to a private developer by the Postal Service. They went through a sort of a RFP process to select the suitable developer for the site. And then in terms of what surrounds the site there to the southeast is an art to neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, it's largely developed with single family homes, but it's zoned R2. There's a in just an industrial campus and to the northeast, as well as the site of the new retail post office, which is going to be behind the distribution building there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's going to be off of Grand. There are industrial and institutional uses to the north and industrial and retail uses across Redondo in the city of Signal Hill. Directly to the south of the site is the California National Guard facility.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The site for that's for development is just over 19 acres. It's actually a 20 a few and it's just over 20, if you include the part that's been split off to be for the new retail store. And the zoning is a combination of industrial and institutional to the north, be it's institutional to the south, and then it's'",
        "'speaker_9': 'residential to the east, and then a signal hill to the west, also zoned industrial. Now, part of tonight's request has to do with the zone change because the current zoning of the site is institutional, which is which would not allow for a light industrial kind of a development.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the proposed zoning is what's called PDS seven. It is one of the city's zoning documents, and it's called the Long Beach Business Park. It currently exists to the northeast of the site and therefore the zone change would extend the PD seven boundary to the Southwest to include the subject site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the developer proposes to build three new light industrial buildings, which would total 425,000 square feet. And that's what requires the approval of the site plan review. The subdivision is proposed to create an individual lot for each building, and that would allow for separate ownership of the buildings should that financial option become necessary.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I did talk about the zone change from institutional to PD seven. The zoning code amendment would be to alter the existing text of PD seven to create a new sub area. And actually, that might be better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I can illustrate that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right now, PD seven is is divided into three sub areas and the inclusion of the institutional site would be a fourth sub area and that necessitates the zoning code amendment. And lastly, for environmental review, the project did go through an initial study and resulted in a mitigated negative declaration, which I'll talk about a bit after I describe'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the site plan. So the project, as mentioned, is designed with three industrial buildings. The largest is to the south, and this site plan is oriented with north to the left. So the largest building is to the south and the two slightly smaller ones to the north.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the uses proposed for the buildings would be clean, light, industrial manufacturing, processing, research and development and local fulfillment type uses. There are truck courts for the buildings there, slightly of a U-shape, and that would allow for loading docks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The truck courts are 135 feet deep, which would allow for a sort of local fulfillment. But they are not as deep as, let's say, the typical logistics, heavy duty logistics uses that you would find in a larger facility.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's important because the setting in which this is proposed is a lighter industrial nature, not intended to be any kind of a heavy trucking or heavy, heavy industrial use. The proposed buildings are of the architectural style you see on the screen, and they are a very high quality, modern, clean look with defined entries and and generally'",
        "'speaker_9': 'clean edges. The buildings are designed to be comprehensive with each other and they all match. So I'm going to go through the elevations. And there is a sort of an aerial rendering so you can see what the whole site looks like from Redondo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did talk about the zone change a bit. And so I'm just going to summarize by saying the zone change would allow for a light industrial development on what is zoned institutional today. And this is the sub area map that I talked about.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So sub area four is the subject site and it's to the southeast corner.

        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm just so thankful that we have a guarantee now that we will not be using just a pony while with the USPS, but we will have a full size wall. It's important to the community, it's important to my neighbors, it's important to all of us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I want to appreciate the neighbors that are here today and also the developer. And this is a fantastic project. This is the way that government works. This is when government works, how it works, even if it was a little slow, but not from our city staff.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'We'll have a staff report again from Kari Tai, our current planning officer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Good evening again, Mayor Garcia. Members of the city council to know that before you tonight is an update to the city's zoning ordinance with regard to the regulation of tattoo parlors. Just a bit of background. In 2010, the U.S., the ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that tattooing is protected under the First Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then fast forward to March of 2017, where the city was involved in a lawsuit. And the court ruled, or at least had preliminary findings, that the existing zoning code unreasonably restricted the permitted locations of tattoo parlors in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so therefore, in order to comply with the preliminary findings of the city attorney's office and city staff is proposing this update to the zoning code. Just to go through some existing regulations today, our zoning only permits new tattoo parlors with the with a conditional use permit in the following zones, just the H W zone and then'",
        "'speaker_9': 'also the downtown plan and the midtown specific plan areas. That's it for all the entire city. And so in addition to that, there are buffers, there's a separation requirement of 1000 feet from adult entertainment uses as well as tattoo parlors and bars.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there's also hours of operation regulations in terms of one of the reasons that the existing tattoo regulations seem to be pretty restrictive is that there there has been through time a sort of a negative stigma with regard to tattoo parlors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, and however that and basically today there are nine licensed tattoo parlors in the entire city of 50 square miles. Times have changed a bit. And not only that, but the with the court's new finding, there was the need to update the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The zoning code. So one of the first things that we did was study some of the more cutting edge tattoo ordinances throughout the state of California, many some of which like Oceanside and Hermosa Beach, also resulting from court challenges.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the proposed zoning code amendment would allow tattoo parlors by right, which means no conditional use permit that allows for certainty to be built in the process whereby an applicant can open up the zoning code, open up a zoning map, and determine for themselves in a clear and concise fashion whether a tattoo parlor would be allowed in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a specific location. So tattoo parlors would be allowed by, right, as proposed in all of the commercial zones, with the exception of the sea ice zone. That's the one that's specifically reserved for self-storage and commercial storage facilities. But the rest of them would be a sizable for a tattoo parlor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Also, we would propose to allow tattoos in commercial zones in the in the plan development districts such as the downtown plan, such as the Midtown Plan, such as a PD one, which is the southeast area, up soon to be secret plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then we would also propose to retain a locational buffer, which is 500 feet away from existing tattoo parlors, as well as 500 feet away from schools in your pocket. We did include a map that looks like the one on the screen that details where tattoo parlors would be allowed based on those proposed criteria.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as you can see on the map, there's a peach color and that's generally throughout the city where tattoo parlors would be permitted and they run along the commercial corridors. The proposed zoning code amendment also has proposed performance standards.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The reason is that these performance standards take the place of conditions of approval. Thereby, when the city permits a tattoo parlor, the up the the business owner or the applicant would have to agree to operate that tattoo parlor in accordance with these performance standards for the life of the business.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that includes hours of operation between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m.. Prohibition of service of alcohol and the like. And this is I would like to mention, in addition to existing health department requirements and other requirements that are outside of the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so this would be in addition to the other requirements. The Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on this item on February 1st and forwarded a recommendation to the City Council for approval.

        "'speaker_8': 'I'm Eric Garcia, counsel. Well, my name is Joe Kasher, and I've been a tattoo artist for 27 years. I own Ace of Hearts Tattoo on Pine between seventh and eighth. And I have specific knowledge of this type of deal because I was helpful and instrumental in the legalization of tattooing in 1997 in New York.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was actually on the board that recommended that tattooing be legalized in New York and actually in that because of that. New York became a disaster as far as tattoo shops go. And by that, I mean the regulation that you guys are bringing down won't help tattooing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not 100% against opening other zones of the city to tattooing, but this kind of 0 to 60 mentality that I feel is happening right now is very scary to me as a tattooer. And as far as keeping the tattooing, the quality of tattooing in Long Beach, which has that many shops, I guess eight or nine.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We all know each other. We all kind of police each other. All of them are owned by tattoo artists. Opening the city up like this will have a negative effect in countless ways, but one of the main ways is people will see Long Beach, which is a great city and has a rich tattoo history as a cash'",
        "'speaker_8': 'cow. Non tattoo artists will open because there are no regulations saying a non tattoo artist can open a tattoo shop and they'll come in, drop their minimums down to negative. So there will be that part of it, which will be the financial for the other tattoo shops.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There won't be any regulation on infection control because I've dealt with the health department very closely and Glen Fong and I worked very hard together to get everything and I went through a lot of jump through a lot of hoops, let's say, to make sure that everything was perfect in my shop.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just feel that it's very detrimental to the tattoo face of Long Beach to just immediately open up what seems to be so much more of the city to anybody who wants to open a tattoo shop. And I understand it's because of the lawsuit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when I talked to people, the lawsuit was very instrumental in what happened. It's not good for tattooing and the industry in Long Beach, and I think Long Beach has had it's really the way it is right now is fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And like I said, I'm not against opening up other zoning areas slowly, maybe letting a couple of other tattoo shops open every once in a while or every year or so. But just opening up the whole city, I think is a huge mistake.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There will be if you go down, up and down Hollywood Boulevard and you see the way those tattoo shops are, there's no regulation. People get infections. There's a huge amount of people getting infection because no one's policing them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And health department, I don't think has the manpower to police every one of the tattoo shops, of which immediately there will be, you know, as many as you could possibly imagine.'",

With regards to the proposed ordinance and the specific part of it that outlines as part restrictions on marijuana distribution to that Section 5.9 of the Long Beach Municipal Code already prohibits that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't know why that should be included in this particular ordinance. Additionally, if the purpose of this ordinance is to try to make it so that you're not going to have this being challenged in court, I don't see any particular reason why you have the buffer zone for near K-through-12 schools, unlike, say, comparable comparably to another'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sensitive use like marijuana, where there is an existing federal law that requires a certain buffer zone for that. There are no such prohibitions for tattoo parlors. I mean, a sense they should be regulated for marijuana use perspective. Now, I guess to say a barbershop and with regards to the again, to the specific of what was being outlined'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in that proposed ordinance, I think the other speaker spoke to it really to articulate as well, despite the fact that we have land, that we have health and safety powers, there were no specific outline health requirements as part of the on that proposed ordinance from a you know, the you're dealing with the injection of subcutaneous inks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that, you know, basically an autoclave, for example, would be required for that or certain capital investments in order to make sure that a tattoo parlor is safe and regulated as part of the rest of the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and close public comment and move on to the council accounts and reports.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I want to thank staff for the presentation. I know this is something that you guys have been working on since I got into office nearly 19 months ago. And so I did have a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that right now we have four parlors that have conditional use permits, and I know that we have in here proposed performance standards and that it includes operations, appearance and health and public safety. When we we're referring to the state and city health regulations to be enforced, are those regulations particular to parlors?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Those are specific for any tattoo parlor that opens and that would apply both to any proposed new parlors as well as existing parlors. They are subject to the state regulations as well as the local city of Long Beach Health Department regulations which require training in how to handle Bloodborne.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's see what it's called here. Bloodborne Pathogens. They generally just make sure that the the facilities and the equipment are safe and that the employees that are employed in the tattoo parlor have been trained appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So in addition so we passed this today, will new parlors come in, be subject to a new conditional use permit or just by these guidelines?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Only these guidelines. The whole point of this was to based upon the the lawsuit, it the basis of it was that the city was making it too restrictive for the type of use. So the whole intent in working with the city attorney was to craft language that allowed an appropriate amount of permissiveness and that did not discriminate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'against the use based upon any specific type of characteristics of the use. So no new tattoo parlors would require a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then let me ask for the locational buffer requirements. We have 500 feet from an existing tattoo parlor and public or private schools. What was that number based off of? Was that the state recommendation or did we come up with that in-house?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for your question. So staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Studied.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Several.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Aspects with regard to buffers. Number one, the the most recently adopted tattoo ordinance from the city of Oceanside was was an example, but also using existing buffers for other land uses. There are several other land uses that also use the 500 foot buffer from schools and namely alcohol as well as alcohol, beverage manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so with the existing buffer being 1000, we wanted to make it less restrictive. And so we took the cues from Oceanside as well as other land use buffers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thanks for answering those questions. I want to say, you know, I know that tattooing has come a long way as a form of art. My mother had slaves. I might have one or two. And I know that Long Beach is a city that embraces the arts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have some folks in the Arts Council here today as well. And recognizing that the staff report includes kind of the pass view of the tattoo artists, which was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An interesting perspective.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to say, as a councilmember in the second District, I wholly support new artists coming in, making sure that we are doing this in a responsible way, that we're protecting the health and safety of our residents, and that we recognize this as an art form.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we have a new parlor opening up in the second district. I believe his name is Carlos, who is well known in Los Angeles and really is going to bring some more attention to the city about being a world class art city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope that, you know, I know we used to have on the Queen Mary, we had a big event around tattoos and trying to make sure that we're celebrating that, but doing that in a respectful way. And so I support the staff's items.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know you guys worked hard on this, and I appreciate all of that. I ask my colleagues to also support this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to say that I'm appreciative of staff as well. And thank you to the owner of Ace of Hearts for being here. You're in my district and I really love the quality of your work. When I pass by there, you're open really late and we like North Pine to be open in a time where it'",
        "'speaker_9': 'looks active. And we really appreciate you being here. I, too, have a question, though, just related to the the 500 feet. I know we are trying to be less restrictive. I see other cities may push to 700. Would that be any would that be a big issue for us?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just I know in the downtown we're already dense, you know, so it just 500 is pretty narrow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is certainly a reasonable request. And if we are so directed, staff would certainly go back and take a look at that and bring something back to council. That's not my understanding because it was not originally proposed that we could change on the floor tonight, but we could certainly bring it back if that is the direction of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, that would be great. I appreciate that. Thank you very much for your work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I want to thank staff for their work as well, understanding that this was brought on as a result of a lawsuit. But in my opinion, we probably should have been ahead of this a long time ago.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I did have just a follow up question regarding the the health and safety standards for the proposed tattoo shops. What is in place now? It says the ordinance reads that the applicant shall comply with all applicable state, county and city health human services regulations, including but not limited to the State Safe Body Art Act.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm not really familiar with the State State Body Art Act, but I am curious to know what sort of local enforcements will we have and provisions do we have in place right now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll go into them very briefly because we didn't go into it in great detail here because it wasn't so much a land use issue. But in short, let me just quote from the staff report here. Any body art practitioners are required to annually register with the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have to obtain annual bloodborne pathogen training. They have to provide documentation of hepatitis B vaccine status. They have to obtain specific health information from their clients, including an informed consent for anyone who they perform body art on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's just a really brief summary of them. We can certainly, if you'd like more detail, we can get more detail and bring that back to you. But that's just a sampling of the kind of procedures that our health department requires for anyone who's actually performing body art.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So they must be licensed. They must be trained, and they must take appropriate precautions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All right. Thank you very much. I think that's a very important element here and possibly something we need to look at further.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I had one other question. Just to be clear for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those that are already.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Open and have a conditional use permit, if we change the number of feet that another parlor can be, are they still grandfathered in?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are correct. They would be considered as legal nonconforming users.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I'm going to say a comment in return of the city attorney. Just as a reminder, I think some people spoke to is that the impetus for this conversation, one has really been about this this case coming to federal court, and we were in federal court on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so it's important that we react and respond to the findings of a of the court as well as what's going on with case law across the country on this particular issue. The second thing is, I think it's pretty clear, regardless of the federal court issue, the stigma around tattoos and body art is at a completely different'",
        "'speaker_4': 'place than it was 20, 30 years ago. And the the businesses that opened today, the the art that's happening, the kind of commitment to quality operations, I think is really important. I also want to thank the gentleman that spoke today, and I just also want to be clear to those watching that regardless of whether we open up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'additional tattoo parlors, which are illegal conforming use, they have to follow very strict state and local health regulations. And so we would never allow one to open that didn't meet the highest standard of health and safety codes, of which are which are both local and state level law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so those would have to be met regardless of changes to this to this ordinance that we have in front of us today. So I just wanted to clarify that. Mr. Park and Jeff, anything else?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. Yes. As mentioned by Councilmember Gonzales, I think what the council will be voting on tonight is to make the change to the buffer from 500 feet to 750 feet. We would need to take that back, make that and then bring it back to council for approval of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this evening, if I understand the amendment to the main motion would be not we can't approve it tonight, but we would update the ordinance to the buffer and then it would come back at a later date.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, that's correct. And I said 700, but if seven.'",
        "'speaker_7': '5700, I thought it was seven. Okay. 7.7.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, sure.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. said he tried to do a negotiation on that because I think we could if.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We could select a date certain we would eliminate the need to re notice it. If we just take it back this evening and come back, we would have to re notice the hearing.'",

City data and traffic studies throughout this country confirm that the risk of a fatality drastically increases for pedestrians when vehicle traffic around pedestrians has speed limits of 30 miles per hour or higher.'",

The fatality rate is nearly 50% at 40 miles per hour, and 79% of pedestrians struck at this speed sustained serious injuries.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'worst corridors, where do we find the most instances of vehicle and pedestrian accidents to occur? That information would certainly help inform how this ordinance would move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, then I would ask my colleague, is there a time frame that you have on this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Once it's approved, the city attorney's office would commence drafting the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that would be correct. But as Mr. Beck said, we would need that safety study to verify and justify the ordinance before it came back. So we would be working with public works on this recommend if it is approved this evening based upon the information we received from the safety study.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it may not come back right away, but it would come back after the safety study.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I know that we've spent many years talking about our vision zero.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hopes and dreams. And for those that don't know, Vision Zero.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'For everybody and we have zero.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Traffic incidences. And so I just want to make sure that that is in alignment with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if it is, then I will support this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, thank you very much. I fully support this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great councilmember area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Given that there was an accident, fatal accident not too long ago in my district, right around Long Beach Boulevard. And Wardlow well, the individual who was struck was not on the median. He was an individual that consistently was on the median.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He just wasn't at the time of that accident. So I am fully supportive of this this ordinance, and I hope that it goes forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Counsel Juan Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I appreciate this as well. To make sure we, of course, get to Vision Zero. I also wanted to see if we can include in I don't know how if this would be possible, but we have people that are constantly on the metro rail line as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know we've had a lot of discussion with that. Of course, we have our metro representative here, as in our mayor. But maybe just as a another caveat within this ordinance, we can just work closely with Metro to ensure that people are not getting on, that the tracks, they're not jumping over the fence because it becomes'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a huge issue as well. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. We're going to move on to public comment a public comment on this item. Please come forward. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Good afternoon, city council members. My name's Gay Shelton. I live here in the first district a couple blocks from here, and I appreciate this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Public safety is, of course, one of the reasons that we're here. However, it mentions here that the staff report that was issued last September, I imagine, was a two from four. I'm sorry I never had a chance to review it dealt with the feasibility of these actions, and the report that we have in hand says nothing about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'feasibility. So I'm curious about it. Feasibility to me means cost. And when it comes to public safety, maybe cost isn't something that we care to talk about, but feasibility when we're talking about spending public funds to do such things as I would imagine would be required to prohibit people being on these medians, would be landscaping, fencing, bollards'",
        "'speaker_4': ', maybe, and the maintenance and and so on. That goes with any signaling that might have to be added to intersections or areas where there's where there's median strips, lighting, perhaps striping. That would change. What we're looking at is something that that we don't know how feasible it is in terms of how many thousands, hundreds, millions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who knows how many dollars would have to be spent in order to do this? We also don't have any sense from the public's perspective of how much of an impact there actually is. Where are their median scripts that are less than four feet wide?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How long are they? Are we talking about only at intersections or for miles and miles where there might be a narrow median that would have to be somehow protected from from pedestrian occupancy? So if we're really going to do this, I think the public deserves to hear something about the costs, about how many miles of medians have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'been identified, just what this is all going to look at. Again, we understand the need and it's simply repeated in this in this document. But the public is in the dark as to the feasibility and the cost. So I do appreciate hearing from you guys any questions that you might have for staff that could illuminate us on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that. Thank you very much. Thank you, Nic. Speaker, please. Stephanie Dawson, CEO, Democratic Socialists of America, Long Beach Branch. As we discussed, as Councilwoman Pryce illuminated, this particular ordinance has been pretty much constructed in a way that makes it almost bulletproof to any particular challenge that would happen from, say, for example, the ACLU of Southern California as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's been constructed in a to provide a what's the word? Again, I'd rather describe it. It lacks a discriminatory intent. However, the discriminatory impact of this law will be unavoidable in combination with the recent prohibition against the bike shop, baking bicycle shop, chop shops and other type of actions that are being there designed specifically to be able'",

If you're applying for Social Security disability, that's going to be, what, $600 a month or so? You know, people need a way to be able to live, especially with the rising costs of rent in Long Beach, which I think we'll'",

You know, I've seen the fences go up on seventh and seventh near Bellflower and PCH, and I've oftentimes close to Long Beach Boulevard and Wardlow.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I see the people who are out there on those medians there. You know, Councilmember Price listed a lot of people who might be on the medians, you know, nonprofits. But the the people that she didn't talk about are the people who are most often there are those that are houseless, people without homes, people who are trying'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to earn money. And I'm all for safety. I'm all for keeping them safe. I think they do deserve that. But on top of that, I think they deserve other things as well, like a roof over their head.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That whatever happens when we implement this, that the people who are there aren't going to be severely punished because if it's a fine or something like that that they're given, these are people who can't pay that literally cannot pay that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I hope when we move forward with the safety ordinance, we keep those people in mind. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I knew that they were the subject. They are the only people that are on the media and by and large, the homeless. You don't see a lady nursing her baby on the median. No one coming from the grocery store with the flowers in the hand on the median.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the homeless. And some of you are running for re election. You said you were going to represent everyone. Yes. Everyone in it is offensive. But you have not probably shaken one hand of the homeless. One hand. How can you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How can you? That is not justice. To now say to these people, we don't want to say, you asked for money. We're not giving you a nickel of our spending. We don't want to see you with a sign asking for a nickel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's why you're saying it. God sees it. That's what you're saying. Guilty. Your local charity. Don't give out to panhandlers. But there are no local charities where those signs are posted. The mediums is all they have. And I will continue to take food on the median.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Matter of fact, I'm going to start printing up some signs. Give these people your dollars because it's against the law for them to ask you in jail to say, give to those who asked, to give to anyone who asked you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am defending the cause of the poor. Some of you said you would do it. Where are you now? Yes. The shame is what it is. We have officers surrounding him with guns and sticks and they will protect you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was protecting the homeless. I mean, protect like the officers with their weapons. It is offensive to that God you saluted tonight. It's an offense.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Well.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We have two parades in this city every year, that people jam on the medians. This may be left unsaid, but we need to make sure that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We protect those people. During a Belmont Shore parade and the Veterans Day parade that when they're on the mediums are not breaking the law. So there's got to be some type of exception to it, I would think. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name is Liz Waites. I would just like to comment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On a particularly disturbing and frankly sickening trend that I've noticed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But also it's happening in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'California, is these very thinly veiled attempts at shoving the homeless away out of sight. I noticed with the CSC or the Public Relations Department, there was some sort of collaboration about let's teach people to not give money to homeless people, give it to shelters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't know if you guys have got the memo, but shelters are pretty brutal. And I just have to say the intention is transparent, the intention to force people out of sight and to not deal with them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're not fooling anybody. And it's cruel and it's sickening. And I really you are here to represent everybody. And just because the homeless people out there cannot, like spare $20,000 doesn't mean that they are not worthy of protection.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That concludes number public comment on this item. So we'll conclude public comment. I will go on to the rest of the council. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. And I just wanted to chime in and I you know, I tend to agree that meetings aren't the safest place for things to take place. But I think the audience raised to two questions that I would just like for city staff or the originator motion to speak to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So first, Mr. Lurch, thanks for raising the issue of the meeting. And so we want to make sure that we protect, you know, whatever whenever the street closures and and we actually have the opportunity to engage that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We used it really well this last year in the Veterans Day parade sort of a line things along the median food trucks, things like that. So first I want to just address that. So, Mr. Beck, is there a way that we can make sure that we really take an accounting of when we do utilize the media and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'make sure that's reflected in this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Y would defer to the city attorney, but I would imagine we could easily add in special events would be excluded from any provisions that get written.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would agree with that. I think that the the ordinance and when we talked about when we would the delay in coming back is the safety study that's going to be conducted has to justify both the location and the action that the ordinance would be taking that to show that it is truly a safety issue and it's'",
        "'speaker_7': 'not a pretext for removing people from medians. So you're not going to have all medians qualify for this. It'll depend on the safety engineer and the safety study to justify the location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That makes a lot of sense. And then so the second thing I'll just raise, which was raised raised by the community here tonight, I want to make sure that we're not taking a step toward penalizing criminally or fining for creating a perpetual system where people can't pay the fine, but rather figure out ways to make medians safer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and sort of a discouraging activity. In the meetings, for example, we had a lot of activity on Jordan High School, people running across the street from Jordan to the apartments. They lived across the street and we wouldn't use the crosswalks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we just built a nice decorative treatment in the median and people respected the crosswalk respect meaning use the crosswalk. So I would love to see industry, I would love to see sort of public works best practices utilized to achieve whatever is the best outcome so that there's no appearance that the intention here is to sort of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'penalize any particular group. And I know and and I would assume that that's not the intention here. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks. And the first mayor, you actually stole my my thoughts here because I was going to say, I think the makeup of the motion, the intent here when you look at the language here, is talking about traffic and, you know, speeds of high speeds of 30, 40, 50 miles an hour.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I think the intent of what what is being proposed is to deal with traffic safety and prevent people from being hit by by vehicle vehicular traffic. Secondly, I think, you know, to your point regarding the treatment that near Jordan High School, I think more of that needs to be done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We need to engineer traffic safety measures. Well, we know we have have problems or potential problems. And so I'd like to see more of that type of those type of solutions on top of this from from our public works department.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just wanted to echo the same concerns that my colleagues recognize and anything that we can do to beautify the areas instead of just putting up a fence that we have some best practices and that this comes after, again, Vision Zero.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that that Vision Zero will help guide us to make sure we're doing it in the right corridors and the right median. So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. There is a motion and a second on the floor to approve item 13. Please cast your votes.'"

        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Well, I want to thank our Human Relations Commission for joining us tonight. I believe we have four members that are with us, maybe five members that are going to take today to give us a little presentation on women's history, particularly focused on Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I'm correct, I haven't seen the whole presentation, but we have to make sure that we take this time, especially with women in politics with. We've got an exciting announcement at the end of your presentation, I believe, on on another event happening in the month.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope we can brighten your moment for the next 15 minutes or so. And let let this get back to you all. I would first like to, of course, thank the women of the City Council for bringing this forward and allowing us to be here tonight to talk a little bit about the state of women.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're going to do this in 15 minutes. So we are not going to even touch a little on what we really should be talking about. But we're going to give you four interesting topics tonight to think about exactly what Councilmember Pearce said.'",
        "'speaker_1': '51% of our population in the last census was women. If you look around this room, I've had enough time to be here. 65% of this room is women tonight. And and and women really have a big part of what we do here.'",

We'll be talking about homelessness and we'll also be talking about politics and the women leaders that we've seen come through our city.

        "'speaker_9': 'Of these.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On nationwide, three women are murdered every day by a current or former male partner in the U.S.. 50% of lesbian women were experienced domestic violence in their lifetimes. One in four women will be victims of severe violence by an intimate partner in their lifetimes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Over 30 million women have experienced physical, intimate partner violence in their lifetimes. These statistics make it evident that domestic violence is an issue that affects the entire nation. But how does it affect Long Beach? According to the US Census Bureau, the population of Long Beach in 2016 was 470,130.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Taking into account that one in four women will be a victim of domestic violence, this means that nearly 117,532 women in Long Beach alone may have been victims of domestic violence. Furthermore, since 2014, women's shelter of Long Beach has served nearly 8000 Long Beach residents.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I now live a life full of joy, love and empowerment. I now have the knowledge and skills necessary to advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves. Stories like Jennifer's show that as a community, we are working towards taking steps in the right direction.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'S.J., who's in a speak on restorative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Justice. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and Councilmembers Kimmy. Monique is from CCE. Jane, also human relations commissioner for the Sixth District. I'm honored to be able to talk a little bit about restorative justice tonight. I know that restorative justice is kind of a buzzword that gets thrown around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I wanted to give you all the opportunity to just hear like a one on one and how restorative justice is being used in our communities here. So to begin, I'd like to share this quote from Frederick Douglass that says, It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would say, actually, people this is a central believed to the tenets of restorative justice. We want to build communities that are trauma informed, that center relationships, that provide alternatives to punitive responses and the harmful impacts that they have on people and offer opportunities for healing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To give an overview of what restorative justice is, restorative justice is a practice and a philosophy modeled from the traditions of First Nations people to prevent and address homes and grow strong communities. We use relationships as a foundation for this work and utilize a needs based framework when intervening in harm to create true accountability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you look at the current ways that we respond to homes and crimes, our default is that we rely on punitive practices for the most part. Typically, a punitive approach asks What was the crime? Who committed the crime, and what punishment is warranted?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And restorative justice model asks us to shift this paradigm and actually think deeply about who was harmed. What is the impact of the crime and the resulting needs and obligations that need to be met to make it right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in short, harms, means and obligations. In this model, we're able to settle the needs of victims or people, people harmed and impacted community members to come to a place of true accountability for the responsible for those responsible for creating the harm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so what does this look like in practice? So restorative justice models are being in. Implemented in a number of settings and are showing tremendous results. So in schools, we're using restorative justice to create communities that value relationships, that respond to behaviors in ways that are trauma informed, that keep students in school rather than suspending and expelling'",
        "'speaker_1': 'people and offer ways for youth and adults to be accountable to one another when conflict and harms occur in the juvenile justice setting. Restorative justice is used to divert youth away from a path of incarceration and system involvement to explore true accountability and uncover what the underlying needs are that may have contributed to any given offense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Families and community members are able to find healing with this process. And you think, given an opportunity to learn about the impact of their behavior on others and grow from their mistakes in communities, restorative justice and restorative processes are used to mediate conflict, to provide resolution to homes, to strengthen relationships, and to identify needs that community members'",
        "'speaker_1': 'need addressed. And so the connection to women, there are many connections to women, but I think the one that I'll touch on is that, as we well know, the burden that women carry when members of the community are removed because of incarceration or any removal from the community is a larger one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To bear a reliance on punitive measures in response to harms and crimes create more broken men, more broken people, rather than building strong children. And so women take on the emotional and actual physical labor, a feeling in the massive gaps when people are removed from communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in the case of children who are removed from communities due to incarceration or system involvement, women again serve in this crucial role in their children's lives to be the ones to take on the additional labor of repairing harm that our system is creating for our young people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So while this just scratches the surface, I encourage for us to do a deeper dove into what restorative justice means for our community. Many connections to actually the prior presentation around domestic violence as well, and many things to explore with regard to community safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. And I would like to bring up my fellow commissioner, Jill Ferraro, to talk about homelessness. Good evening. Mayor Robert Garcia, City Council members thank you. It's always a pleasure to come in speak especially on behalf of something I'm very passionate about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go here. Homelessness. So those four concepts that you're or those four terms you're seeing up there, housing, compassion, relationships and hope creation. I want to bring up the fact that without housing, which we all know about, we're hearing a lot about without compassion and without building relationship with those in our community who are experiencing homelessness and without'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hope creation. We are not going to help homelessness, and especially women with women in our community who are experiencing homelessness. The Department Health and Human Services have a homeless count that you can get this information from. But we're looking at female right now, 28%, male 71%, transgender 1%, and those who do not identify as well up there'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But the reality is 28% is something we get in a homeless count. We also see in our homeless.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'She didn't appear homeless. She took care of herself. She's military, very clean cut, very disciplined. However, she was still homeless. She ended up at the villages of Rio, where she began her recovery. And lo and behold, she has been four years clean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She has been a mentor. She's been working at the VA and she is as happy as can be, although she does have her days where I'll get a phone call or text.

But to all of you out there, women and those who those of you who know women, which is everybody in here, there's a preventative part to homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that preventative part is to grab your sister, your mother, your neighbor, anyone female and that one in for domestic abuse that she was talking about. You make sure you also provide a support system, a mentorship. Because that's how this is going to get better.'",

I don't remember who said it, but it was the best thing that a father can do for his children is to love his wife. And I think that having a wife that is very understanding and having my daughter, who I have a daughter, see that relationship between'",
        "'speaker_7': 'me and my wife, I think she learned a lot in terms of what to expect from men and what to expect in relationships. When she would go out with a with a young man. I had many a conversation with some young men mentoring them in terms of how to treat my daughter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'First of all, do you have a driver's license or do you have insurance? Just as an example. But I think that when it comes down to the treatment of women and we saw the stats that were so awful up there, is that sometimes, you know, we have to break that cycle and it's a cycle.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we as men sometimes have to take the lead ourselves and say we're going to break that cycle and be good to our women, be good to humankind, to people in general. Because when you're carrying two people, you're kind to everybody and everybody will benefit from your kindness.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I want to congratulate the Human Dignity Commission for bringing this forward. I hope we get a report every year. I think that would be a wonderful addition to our to our history Women's History Month or week every year to see how we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And hopefully we can bring some of those stats down and make them a lot, a lot more acceptable. And we don't have to cringe every time we hear those awful statistics. Thank you for being here. Thank you for sharing.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I don't know where that quote came from, but I think that was his own quote because I think it was a great quote. A lot of this I think it shouldn't have to be what we call it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On women's history.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When I think should be women's every day should be a woman's mind. Because the fact that you guys this is what it's all about, you know, without you, you know, we caused by a man's world. But it would be nothing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Not what? That woman. So thank you, young women, for having this man. And we appreciate it so much. Thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I want to thank you for the presentation as well. It was a lot of very good, I think relevant information are presented here. Our Union Human Relations Commission does a wonderful job and I had an opportunity to meet with them a couple of months ago, maybe a few weeks ago, actually, and the time all'",
        "'speaker_10': 'comes together. But I'm very impressed with the work that you are doing and the impact that you're making on our city. I think that has a lot to do with the the makeup of this council. This I think there's more women on this council than ever before in history.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm proud to serve with a number of very, very strong and competent women on the city council. And I think this is appropriate. The woman who had the most impact on my life was my mother. I think she raised me to be a very fair minded, strong young man.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And today. Would have been her 68th birthday. She passed away two years ago. And so when we commemorate strong women, I think think about my mother every every single day. And I try to live my life as an example that she will want me to live by.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you very much for your presentation today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I'll just I'll just add that thank you to the presentation for scheduling this presentation. Thank you to the Human Relations Commission. I think it's important that we do recognize the contributions of folks. But I also think what stood out here and you know, and we see a bunch of recognition, but what stood out was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really the highlighting the vulnerable folks in our society and really letting this moment serve as a call to action that we have to continue. You know, the thoughtful, data driven presentation that really calls us out and says we have to be about the business of rooting out oppression wherever it exists.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that and that we have a responsibility, frankly, to really look out for one another. And so I hear you. And I would encourage, you know, whenever we have these sorts of presentations, leave something for us to work on.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Where their lives are at stake and their mental health is at stake is absolutely incredible.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Financial abuse in relationships is not something that a lot of people are even aware of.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Is the sister or brother sister of socialism.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My mother fled El Salvador because of the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Civil war there, and they were the communists trying to take over the country of El Salvador. They came to this country because of the freedoms and the opportunity that this country gave them, the freedom to purchase property, the freedom to rent their property at whatever price they wanted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If their prices were too high, then they would have to lower their prices. We live in a capitalist country.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'For rent control and use.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Beverly Hills as a support? But anyway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, I, I think that that the market, you know, rents if somebody wants to charge you know a lot.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. My name is John Angel. I was born and raised in Long Beach and I've been in the housing industry for 45 years. Recipients of this measure are not being means tested, means testing means an examination into the financial state of a person to determine eligibility for public assistance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This measure this measure steals money from landlords and gives it to persons that may very well not need it. Does not make sense to only help people that need help. There are people that need help. Let's help those people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's not help everybody that doesn't need help. You can have a tenant. There's more wealthy and have more assets and income than the landlord that's going to receive rent control. This is very bad for the community as landlords will slow maintenance and stop improving properties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Property managing real estate is very time consuming and costly. Existing tenants will never move and new tenants will pay more. With no supply of available housing. This is economic injustice for all at its peak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your testimony. Mexican police.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mark Panetta is going to come at it from a different perspective. I own rental property and rent control areas as well as non rent control areas. And you know, at a high level, it just doesn't work. Rent control.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Both economists on the left and the right agree that it doesn't work. When you have a relationship with a tenant under rent control, you have to be very unforgiving if they're late on the rent, whereas you might work more with a tenant that's a non rent control area, give them more time to pay, upgrade their kitchen, maybe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'put in some ground it in a rent control area, you extract the maximum and you put in the minimum. You know, that's just the way business works and it does change the relationship. Also, we heard about homeless the homeless crisis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've housed six homeless veterans in rent control areas. I could not put one in a rent control here because just in case something doesn't work out, you have no way to to give notice to that tenant if it's causing a problem in that in that building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we have a duty to keep a building safe for all of our tenants. And I thank you for your time.'",

I would like every person here tonight when you leave here, the highest rate in the nation and you'll find they are all located in rent controlled'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cities. I cut this down to a minute. 300,000 people, renters over there we've vacated out of their apartments in New York when strict rent control laws came into place. So where did this tenants go of the 300,000 tenants go anyway?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Stand up against rent control. Stand up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Let's look at blues names.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Pat Kennedy from Fifth District. Thank you, mayor and council members. I was here in 2005, 2006 talking about, you know, with the need for a housing trust fund. The city council passed a housing trust fund and said, we'll put $500,000 a year from the bed tax into the housing trust fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But and the reason we did that was because people, homeless people are living in motels and contributing to the bed tax each year. However, there was a clause in there that said if available, and for some reason the city managers never found the money available for the housing trust fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we've never invested in a housing trust fund to build affordable housing. We haven't done inclusionary zoning. We haven't created linkage fees. So we have a city that's failed to provide leadership in terms of addressing this housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's not just the city. Obviously, the market has failed us also, if you look at the subprime mortgage. Couple of things I'd like to see if you're going to do some research. How many absentee landlords do we have in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How many how many dollars from monthly rent end up in the local economy? And the final question is, what would be the increase in community safety if we stabilize rental communities? Thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Fully understand why rent control cities so huge declines in rental properties. But of all the pages of Byzantine rules and regulations, I found the introduction in Section two in the preamble the most damning. There are 15 subsections in Section two and only five offer bits of data to back up their imminent warning of doom.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The other ten subsections appear to be made up and completely subjective. It doesn't seem right that unverified statements can be made without documentations and presented as fact. To their credit, they did use correct facts when they referenced the horrible housing problems in Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But a laughable lapse of logic in the petition in Section two, A and B makes reference to the grave situation in housing in Los Angeles as a basis for bringing rent control to Long Beach. If there is a poster child for the ill effects of price fixing rent, it has got to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Be Los Angeles. Los Angeles is the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You use to prove rent control does not work and makes the problem worse. Price fixing fair rent is the same as taking the wrong medicine and finding out the proposed cure is worse than the disease. So no matter the changes in the House, which you might consider to the petition, you still are price fixing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At the end of the day, you have a program that will turn away investors and developers. You will have a program that decreases property values for apartments as well as private homes, resulting in a decline in value forms.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Sir, for your testimony. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I think reviewing questions on this topic is incredibly important because if it's implemented.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It will affect every single resident and person in this city. Price controls and eviction restriction policies are commonly associated with Byzantine bureaucracy, onerous requirements and counterproductive outcomes. It is important that clarity is obtained on some of the details as it will help us cut through the rhetoric.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Community members should not be pitted against each other as we seek to find clarity on issues of shared concern. We thank the council members and we urge you to support reviewing these questions.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'The elements of a local housing crisis can be summed up as this affordability, supply and habitability. The supply issue was addressed best by the land use element. Affordability is a more complex issue given the parameters of capitalism. Rent control is just one tool used to address affordability by ensuring that the rents paid by the working poor who'",

Tools for including the use of contractor development agreements are already being employed by the City of Long Beach and are not doing the job.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The problem of habitability remains largely unaddressed by this council, but it remains a serious public health and equity issue. My questions are as follows What ever happened to the preemptive inspection program? Wait. Why is this council still being concerned about the marketability of the Long Beach housing stock?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This myopia is at best helping heal local housing bubble and is at worst a sign that you're ignoring your primary responsibility as a council, protecting the rights of the residents and not property. We all know that the large percentage of the parasitic landlord class here have 714 area codes, and frankly, their return on their investment should do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the last thing you are concerned about, especially given the fact that, unlike them, we actually vote on your on your elections. Where are the increased calls for housing inspectors are credibility poor can be directly tied to the massive cuts the city has made to the city of Long Beach's workforce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Without it put more housing inspectors to ensure the safety and health and safety of our residents, we again are at the mercy of the private sector doing that. Engage in a race to the bottom.'",

Actually, I want to thank you for your foresight tonight in preparing so thoroughly for the coming of rent control. Collecting relevant information gets the city ready to act as soon as the measure is passed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it can also help to dispel some of those scary scenarios that are already being spun by the opponents. And I sincerely believe that this measure will pass. I'm getting enthusiastic signers to the petitions in the north part of Long Beach, in the downtown area and on the east side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a member of the faith community and a church that is on the east side, most of whose members are I won't say most, but a large number of our members are property owners. And they're eager, eager to sign these petitions even are the landlords in in the congregation, because these are the local landlords.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have relationships with their tenants. They treat them fairly. They want to keep their properties rented and at a rate where they can keep up their improvements on it, but also get a fair return on their investment. So I sincerely hope that you will.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'That you have seven pages of questions here. I hope we're not limited to those questions to be considered as this goes to the staff, for your information. The council has it's not a policy, at least an urge to have less than 60% of the city as renters and more than 40% as owners.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Somehow to shift that that paradigm, to use that word again. That's going to take the changing of thousands, tens of thousands of units of housing from renting to owning. And there's only so many tools in the basket. One of those is condo conversions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't know if we'll ever solve it through condo conversions, except for one thing. I think you're probably going to learn that this rent control ordinance could result in the loss of rental units. And what will those units become?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They'll become owned units. And so what you've got here is the opportunity to ask staff to report to you if we get rent control, which would be a good thing if we're really honest about trying to convert renters to owners, then we need to know what is the quantity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That rent control could change that paradigm here in Long Beach. Are we going to get maybe 20,000 condo conversions, 50,000 condo conversions? So that's a question that isn't anywhere in this list which could back you up for voting for rent control.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I'm I'm I missed that part. And then I had another guy who, you know, I thought, this is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A city, you know, built by veterans. I had another guy live. He just said he would rent to veterans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because, well, rent control.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It would be kind of hard to get them out. But, you.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'It's a beautiful thing. And I bring that up because as a part of the black community here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is a declining one. 6037 people, according to the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'US Census of African-American origins, left the city. Maybe that's because 73% of the black population in the city are renters, and with the fluctuation in rent prices, we are most impacted, going from 14% of the population of the city to now 12%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So being that as in May, we need rent control. We need rent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Control because we don't need to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Evicted from our buildings for Airbnb. We don't need to be evicted for our buildings for people who want to have demographic change in particular neighborhoods in this city, we need rent control. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I invested all of my life's work and earnings into a housing unit so that I could perhaps live a good life here in Long Beach and retire. If this goes through, it will be taken from me, period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that this is the United States where we have a freedom of choice. This takes it away and it puts on the backs of people that did nothing wrong except invest in Long Beach to subsidize the all the social ills that we're facing today.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Of Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Still are the work force that this ordinance claims to protect. The workers, your workers, the Long Beach workers, teachers, nurses, maintenance, grocery, hotel, retail, bus drivers, etc. Each of our owners invested in this city and this industry as part of their retirement goals, goals that are now being threatened.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'How many absentee landlords that we have? I think that's important for us to know.

        "'speaker_1': 'Number one, rent control is bad for everyone. This is patently false. Just as this housing crisis does not impact everyone equally, neither does rent control. Displacement overwhelmingly affects low income communities of color. And in the 13 California cities that have passed rent control, these measures have prevented low income tenants from being displaced as market rents rise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's according to a study by the Urban Displacement Project. Number two, rent control raises rents.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That we're seeing in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Number three, landlords aren't responsible for rising rents and shouldn't be punished with rent control regulations. This is opposed to rent control isn't a punishment.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'a long time. That's not the way it works. I don't know if you realize this, but the average housing stock in Long Beach is about the 1920s. Have you ever tried to take care of a building that was built in the 1920s?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know who said that they're only going up by 1%. But in 2015, 2016, according to Zillow, it was seven and a half. Part of the reason the prices are going up has nothing to do with landlords being greedy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It has to do with the fact that people like me over the last 14 years haven't been adding anything to the rent. And I'm sorry, but there's a point where we have to catch up. Otherwise the building will be sold and my tenants would be homeless because quite frankly, it's on 5000 feet of land.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We'd like to have that return recognized or that investment recognized and considered as an expense, unlike the measure that's in front of you is excluded and there are protections for eviction. It's under California state law. The city attorney is well aware of that.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Market whatsoever in San Francisco, as studied at Stanford University, this is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'NPR data. What's interesting to note is that the actual benefits for tenants were cited as $7.085.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Billion, and that's based on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The fact that they were able to afford the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Rents, they were able to build what they were able to save that money. What's interesting about that number is that that is only for one specific year, 1994. They didn't count any renters before that or after that. So there are literally billions of dollars in benefits to tenants in wealth building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the best part about this is that the study.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also concluded that landlords didn't end up feeling any harmful effects. They continued to get a fair return on their properties. So thank.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I do the best I can. I haven't seen my dad in three weeks. Why? Because he's in his fifties. Because he had to get another job to pay for the rent increase they are renovating and all they're doing is painting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why are you so afraid of rent controlled? Because it can exploit us now. Because we can't take those out. Don't. And let's just be clear. They go into neighborhoods, to poor neighborhoods. You you choose to buy poor apartments and then you paint it and you double the price.'",

There is no action that the city council can take this evening either for or against rent control.'",

It's actually not as democratic as it could be. I think this is democracy and initiative is an unfortunate thing.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And for my colleagues here, I know that each and every one of us, I can speak for myself, but I know that everybody behind this dais cares about this issue deeply. This is something that each and every one of us spends a lot of time putting, a lot of thought into a lot of research into and and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'we're looking for answers every day. This is not something that popped up yesterday. This is something that we've been dealing with for four years. And we've also have taken deliberate steps to to address our housing issues through because of the issues that you've brought before us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, it's our job to take care and to make a difference. This is I want to be clear. This is not a black and white issue. This is not an easy issue or eternal. There's no panacea to fixing a housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. This is not a Latino issue. This is. This issue engages and involves seniors and people from all backgrounds in our city. And and I think every district is impact impacted on this. I've done a lot of research and I've been looking at the 15 cities in California that actually do have rent control.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm not convinced that it's a panacea for for for for our housing crisis. I do think and I have been very deliberate, we need to build more housing in the city that we passed the land use element and went through that process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was a it was a painstaking process to go through. But we are laying out and putting the foundation together for to improve this situation. Now, I think the challenge before this council really is going to be is how do we fast track?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, because I don't think we can we can wait three, four, five, six years for housing to be developed. We need to make it happen now. And and I will say that, you know, San Francisco I was talking to an elected official in San Francisco just last week.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He was talking about the rent control, but was also talking about the the fact that the average rent for for a two bedroom apartment is somewhere close to four, $5,000 a month. I don't know if that's that's what he said.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. That's that's that's serious. Santa monica. It's it's the rents are very, very high there. Beverly Hills, Berkeley, West Hollywood, San Jose. These are all cities that that have rent control. Right. And and when you look at the average rents in Long Beach, we are well below those cities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm not saying that that is a good that is a fact. And that's something that we all need to take into consideration. I'm not saying what we need to do in the city also is is focus on creating great jobs because that's going to bring the incomes up and that's going to be prudent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's going to put people in a in a better position to be able to afford quality housing. And I speak to quality housing because that is where this I think the issue started a few years ago. You know, we we had our housing advocates come before the council and say, hey, that the the quality housing the quality'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of our housing isn't where it needs to be. We know we have old housing stock, but but we heard stories and we're still hearing stories about subsub, you know, horrible living conditions that people have to live through. We sought to improve that by bringing forth a prep policy.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We we we raised the minimum wage in the city. We've made deliberate efforts to address these issues, and we're going to continue to do that. So I want to again thank my colleagues for bringing forth this, this, this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This item. I want to thank everybody for having, I think, a heartfelt conversation about this. I think this conversation is going to continue over the course of the next several months, and it's going to be a citywide conversation that needs to be had.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm going to tell you right now that I'm not I'm not sit in on any sort of policy. Yes, no or indifferent. I'm waiting for a lot of this information to come back. But again, I do not think that there is a silver bullet or a or one single solution to this issue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's going to take a full court press and it's going to take a multi-prong strategy to deal with housing. And that's the way we have to do it and do it responsibly. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I, too, want to thank everyone who came out tonight and who spoke and gave testimony on both sides. I think sometimes when people feel passionately about one side or the other, the conversation can get unnecessarily divisive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it takes a while for us to get to some solutions. And hopefully this is part of the start of that process. And we can get to a place where we have some solutions. But, you know, I think I kept reading the item over and over again because as people were talking at the podium, it wasn't clear'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to me that everybody understood why we were here. It's not really council's position to be objective on this particular issue. Certainly we want to learn and we want to hear. We want to continue to get more information. But we're talking about a voter initiative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're not talking about where the council members stand. So, you know, a few people said, you know, you're not objective. I I've done a lot of research on this issue already. I think I have a pretty good understanding of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I have a very strong standing of where I'm at. I don't believe rent control will be beneficial for the city of Long Beach. That's my personal opinion. And but I'm one voter. I'm one voter. And I think that having an opportunity like we have tonight and I appreciate the housing advocates who came forward and thanked'",
        "'speaker_6': 'council and super non those of us who signed on for bringing the item. I thank you for thanking him because in fact that is going to provide us some additional information with which we'll be able to further elaborate on our thoughts or opinions or maybe have our opinions, our minds changed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know. What I will tell you is for me personally and each of us takes a different journey in determining where our policy positions are going to stand. For me, I've read just about every single study that anyone here has sent me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've reviewed analysis of what has happened in other cities that have passed rent control. I've reviewed economists, progressive economists, conservative economists, their analysis of rent control based on all of that. I'm going to formulate my own opinion about the voter backed initiative, should it get to that point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is not an issue where we're asking council to be objective so that they can vote on an item. We're talking about getting more information as we start to educate and have those conversations with the voters. So I think I've been pretty.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've met with anyone who's requested to meet with me on this topic, anyone, and always happy to be educated. But I'm also not going to talk out of both sides of my mouth because I don't think anybody deserves that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's important for you to get a sense of where your representatives stand on this issue. We've certainly had time to educate ourselves. And, you know, I thank everyone for coming out. I agree with Councilman Austin. We have done a lot in the city to talk about the issue of housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Housing is definitely an issue that is a priority for this council. And if you don't believe it's a priority to this council, then you may not have been watching what we've been working on for the last three and a half years and creating opportunities for housing stock and the third district alone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've had specific plans that have been approved and now we had a general plan that was approved. And we've created over 2000 units of additional housing over the course of the next 30 years. That is that is progress.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think the other thing, as you know, we've talked about some policies that I think are going to be detrimental, frankly, to housing needs like short term rentals. I think I personally believe that that is going to take away long term housing units from individuals and how we're having that conversation at the same time that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we're having this conversation. It baffles me, frankly, because I don't know how we can say we want to add more housing for people who are displaced and then say we want to vacate these properties so we can make an income off of taxing it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't understand that. So that's just my personal opinion. And I would I would I would ask the housing advocates to be engaged in that conversation to meet with my office. Let's. Talk about that because that's an area where we have tons and tons of apartments that would be much more lucrative to be rented out as Airbnbs'",
        "'speaker_6': 'than they would as permanent housing for families that need it. So that's where my head's at on this issue. But I thank everyone for coming forward and sharing your thoughts with us and I think my colleague councilman super now for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And yet yet. Yes, thank you very much, Mayor. You know, Jeanette, I want to acknowledge everyone who came out to speak on this item, because I want to thank you for sharing your concerns, because the fact that tonight's vote is requested for an expert, you know, opinion about looking forward to receiving details, reports on an application this'",
        "'speaker_11': 'ballot initiative will have on our city. And I think what will it have in our city? We talk about a ballot that you're going to go to the polls, try to find out where we will stand. And what is really bothered me today is that I look and find out that we don't even have enough votes on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the ballot to even be able to get this passed. So what are we talking about when you talk about rent control, where the people that are supposed to be there to go and get these people to be on put on the ballot in order to get this done.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't think rent control is going to be the key to finding out whether people will be able to stay in Long Beach. I think we're going to have to be able to get jobs. Will it be able to pierce enough money to be able to stay in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And without building not low income housing we're talking about, you say low income, we're going to have to just start building because without that, we're going to have it won't even be about rent control, which is that more, you know, homeless people.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what we're going to have to do is really get serious about putting some houses out here where people can live in Long Beach and having jobs where they can't afford to live in Long Beach. And I think tonight is one of the greatest thing to show people coming out and giving their concerns and how compassion you'",
        "'speaker_11': 'are about this, because I'm a renter myself, but I tell you, I'm going to work and I'm going to make sure that we're going to have to be able to pay my rent. And most of you guys will be able to do the same thing when I look in for a pity party.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. As I understand it, this request is basically a study session. It's it's a study session that's going to come either before us now or come later. So I'm basically going to support this initiative now because the sooner we have our questions answered about what we're going to be dealing with, the better for it is'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for all of us. So I will be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Thanks to everybody for being here. I know we're all very tired. I'm sick probably because we've been averaging about a midnight plus, you know, time here. But these issues are very, very important to us. And so I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that it is true that every time we can collect more information, it serves us all a better purpose. So I really appreciate it. And in addition to this, I know we have to listen to different perspectives and we have to make sure that we know what to expect because something is on the horizon and we'",
        "'speaker_9': 'don't know what that's going to be. Signature gathering may happen and we may get to that point and we don't know what the voters will will do in November. But we do know that right now, I know many of my residents are being served 60 day notices.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They are being displaced. I myself, we're setting up a meeting with beach front, but that's just one out of probably a dozen property managers that I've met with that we will continue to work with, you know, seniors at Plymouth West, people at ninth and Pacific and 10th and Cedar.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're intervening as a city council office. I'm actually writing a letter of support to urge them to offer an extension in some cases, because we know people in 60 days, that's not going to really give you a lot of time, unfortunately, to come up with another security deposit and really get yourself into another place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I just want to let everybody know that we support you there and we'll absolutely do what we can there. In addition to that, we know that some of the conditions that people are living in, although it's not described here and this is off topic, but very relevant to the conversation is, you know, they're living in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'below quality of life issues but below quality of life. And it doesn't speak to all landlords, but it definitely speaks to the very small percent of landlords that we know can do a lot better. And we need to be keeping more track of that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what have we done here? I think our first year in office, many of us actually got together and we did a 120 day violators list and that is posted on Development Services website. And I'm actually working to make that more transparent so people know which landlords are not playing by the rules when it comes to quality'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of life issues, serious quality of life issues. In addition to that, we work to, you know, just to make sure that people have, for instance, seniors that have low income housing currently, that they can stay in that sort of model of low income housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We actually put together a report that asks for options and what we can do to keep those covenants, because we know a lot of those remain in downtown and what can we do after that? But aside from that, I just want to continue with this step because it's very important.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, downtown gets picked on a lot. And I get that, you know, there's a lot of development going on in downtown, but we're home to over 1700 affordable housing units. Currently, we have 300 to 500 more coming online with very low income housing models.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's really it's something I'm very proud about. Do we need to create more? Absolutely, we do. But it needs to be an equitable distribution throughout the city. And I have been I've always said that and I will remain saying that that we need to advocate everywhere in the city, not just in downtown, all all parts, to ensure'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that people can live in Belmont Shore, just like they can live in downtown and still have lower rents in that respect. So I'm with you. I'm listening. And we'll certainly connect, you know, on on what we can do going forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I thank my colleagues again for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I want to thank everybody. It's great to be here at 1105 and have as many people are still present. So I want to thank my colleagues as well for bringing this item forward. I have had many conversations with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Both advocates on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Both sides around where do we have this conversation in our city and how do we do it in a way that reaches as many constituents as possible? I have long said that I support some type of management process, something that allows us to get a handle on the rents in our city and understand what those impacts are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going to be. And I have also said that I have a little bit of some challenges with what is directly in front of us. And having an everything at one time is a bit of a challenge for me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am thankful to have this item here and. To go through the process to answer these questions as at the same time that the community groups are out there advocating and trying to collect signatures, we need to make sure that we have the facts in front of us so that we can advocate on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I did have a question for our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City attorney just to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What this item should.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know there's a lot of questions that will come back. But for tonight, if if the advocates get the signatures and it gets on the ballot and people vote yes on it, is there anything that this council can do to make a change to that ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or does it have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To go back to the voters?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I think the short answer is they cannot it cannot be amended or changed. And I think a couple of the public speakers mentioned that by by the council, the council could put something on the ballot to repeal it or to change it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the voters could vote on that. There could be an initiative that would be a competing initiative that could cancel that out if if in the process of answering all of these questions there or the court determines that maybe some of the provisions of the initiative as written are not constitutional or not valid, then it could be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'changed by the court. But the council could not do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And those flowers look lovely in front of your face. Mr.. You kept bobbing around, though, a nice touch at.'",
        "'speaker_2': '11:00 at night. Okay. I just wanted to be clear that and we can also, as a council, if we get these answers back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The council could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Propose to put something on the ballot that might.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be different than what our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Voters have in front of them right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It it may it depends. If it's a charter amendment, then maybe you could maybe you couldn't, depending on whether you meet the timeframes and the statutory requirements for the November ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you for that. I again, just want to highlight that I didn't hear a lot of comments around the 60 day notice. I get that in my district a great deal and that beach front was one of those factors that seemed to come up a lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I want to let my councilmember know that any help that my office can do to work with them to make sure that we're creating a safe place and a safe home for people. That's definitely the number one priority for me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the second District in downtown, we've created 2000 new residential units developing right now. I do agree that we need to add to the housing stock. I also firmly believe that we need a no net loss policy so that any new developments that come.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Up, we're not losing affordable units on the back end, and that there are several other policies that we should also be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Looking at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To see what is the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Best fit for our city. And so I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do look forward to having these questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Come back. I implore I know today was heated for a lot of folks, but that we don't see this as a black and white issue. I don't see this are when people ask me, are you for rent control, yes or no?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not a question. That's easy to answer because this policy that's in front of us has a lot of detail to it. And so it's about finding the right fit for Long Beach. And that means that we need everybody to be at that table together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I look forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To the responses coming out and I look forward to sitting down the table with all those stakeholders. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this conversation in front of the city council, this much debate with very little that we can actually vote on tonight. So so thank you for that experiment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll just say I'll just say so a few things. So, one, I acknowledge the concern on both sides. I am not deaf to it. I hear it. I see it here when I when I hear week after week, we hear people come down and say, hey, I got a 60 week, 60 day notice or my entire block'",
        "'speaker_3': ', you know, my entire building has gotten a notice. I also hear it when I hear neighbors, my neighbors in North Long Beach, salt of the earth people, working people that work jobs, regular jobs, who have, you know, for one reason or another, maybe one person owned something and another person on to something else, and they got married'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they end up having a rental property. Right. And they made smart choices and they're afraid of us intervening and jumping in those processes. And, you know, frankly, that that's actually something I do encourage homeownership and figuring out a path to build wealth because we have to figure that out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'm not ignoring what's happening. I see that one thing I want know is that the housing crisis is real. The housing crisis is real. And I want anybody see that movie, Butterfly Effect, Butterfly Effect, a guy makes a decision, goes back in time, tries to fix decision, it gets worse, goes back in time again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Try to fix the decision. It gets worse. And I keep and someone came up and talked about the downtown plan. And I remember that conversation because I remember that conversation because I was chief of. Staff to a councilmember here in the ninth District when that conversation did come up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know folks don't like revisiting history, but there was a big debate here. And he said investment and development will beget displacement. And someone said if it is good for one area, that should be good for the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These antibodies placement loss. And you know, I can't speak for the past council, but I can tell you that the anti displacement laws haven't haven't kicked in. And so while yes. I don't know that I'm you know, I don't know that I'm ready to support rent control outright.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I can say is I acknowledge that we need to do something on displacement. We need to address something else significant that happened. Redevelopment, you know, is gone. That was our chief tool to fund housing. It's gone. We have to replace it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's very difficult to build affordable housing without a local source of revenue. So we have to talk about what tough decision is going to make to actually fund housing. I think we need to have a lot more education around this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I'm going to support this motion tonight, but by no means do I expect these questions are really unfair and biased. Unbiased. I think they're need. I would encourage staff to not just be limited by these questions, but do the diligence and try to present a fair and balanced assessment assessment on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the other thing I would say is that someone mentioned that it might be too late to do something about any any specific plans that we've done. I don't know that that's true. I don't know that that's true.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the city is embracing specific plans. We've seen downtown plan, we've seen midtown plan. We've seen see it. We're doing uptown plan. And I think we should look at whether going, going, looking. We look at going back and doing some analysis on whether we really did think about attaching sort of anti displacement laws to specific plans'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if those specific plans do trigger additional investment. I don't I think it was very controversial five years ago. I don't know that it would be as controversial this time. I think in this environment, some people are going to you know, some people are going to say whatever you whatever you suggest is going to be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the reality we have to put all the options on the table here. You can't be in a deficient defensive crouch and say the issue isn't here. I don't want rent control. I don't want just for just calls for eviction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But on the other hand, not not really for do something, you know, in a timely manner. And so I acknowledge the work that the city council has done. I acknowledge the leadership people have shown. But in reality, we we haven't produced anything tangible just yet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that needs to happen. That needs to happen. Or I'm afraid that even if this measure doesn't doesn't qualify for the ballot, who's to say that in two years there won't be another measure that would qualify or qualify for the ballot?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then our hands are tied to the city council. We need to do our jobs and create public policy faster than we're doing it then we're doing because this issue isn't going to go away. So my thoughts are, so I'm going to vote to support this because I believe education is needed, but I do hope that we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'get some sort of fair and balanced assessment of this. And I thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much. Open up. Thank you. I just have one final comment before we go to the mayor in his final comment, but I just wanted to thank everyone for speaking tonight and in particular, thank you for adapting to the 92nd rule.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it was a great experiment and it worked very well. And there are far more people in the audience than there were the last two meetings. And the body language is a lot better. So thank you. Oh, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If there's no council objection in the future, we're going to I'm going to call that the supernatural and we're going to we're going to do that. Okay. I have a couple a couple closing comments. And I obviously, I support the the the item and thank you, councilman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Super on Shirley support getting all the information from the city attorney on the analysis and everyone on on all sides of the issue that came forward tonight. And I want to echo a couple of things that were said.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first is that the issue around housing and homelessness is is the issue of our time for the next ten, 20 years. There is no question that the issue around housing, the issue around homelessness is at the top of every single city's agenda, whether it's Long Beach, whether it's San Francisco, whether it's Santa monica.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With all the other cities that were mentioned tonight, it's the number one issue. What is also true is that people have a variety, different of different opinions of how to get to what I believe most people believe is the same goal, which is ensure that there's enough housing for people making sure that it's people can afford to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have housing and that we're passing good, smart policies that allow people to live productive lives. Nobody I don't believe anyone, whether you are a landlord and certainly not an advocate for housing, wants to see people suffer or displaced.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think there are. A lot of sometimes I think accusations and insults are thrown around. And I don't believe that there are people that that that enjoy seeing people displace or people suffering. And so I think that all of us want the best for everyone in the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's how you get there and what you believe is the best policy that takes us there. I think a couple of things are important. I have said, and I continue to believe with every ounce of research that I have done and absorbed, similar to what Councilwoman Pryce said, that the single best way of getting out of this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'crisis, not just in Long Beach, but statewide, is housing production. And and to ensure that there is to ensure that there is consistent, consistent forms of producing housing of all types, and, of course, particularly housing for those experiencing homelessness, for low income folks, for seniors in need, affordability, but also housing at the workforce level.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for middle class families. You have to build housing of all types that get us out of where we are right now, which is essentially a math problem where our population is grown, but housing production has not. And so that's why you're seeing the pressures that you're seeing across the state of California and in Long Beach as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well. I want to also ask, and maybe it's an expansion of the questions or a friendly to the council member or to Mr. City attorney. I think there's also some misinformation about what actually exists in Long Beach currently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a lot of folks that say we want to have rent control or stabilization or we want this or that. Long Beach has about 6500 units that are rent stabilized. Rent stabilization exists in Long Beach. It has existed for probably 40 years in this community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this idea that rent stabilization doesn't exist is not true. It exists. And I want to make sure we get that exact number maybe and staff can help us with this. Maybe it's 6200 units. Maybe it's 6500 units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the fact is that these units exist in Long Beach and they're mostly in the city of Long Beach. They are for people that are experiencing the people that have disabilities. They're for low income seniors. They're for housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Look the village is at Cabrillo that we support so much in our community out Carmelite cos there's a lot of housing in Long Beach that is already rent stabilized. It's also true that we have increased, not decreased the amount of rent stabilized units in Long Beach over the last few years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so the way we have done that is through production. And so every time we build a project, Councilman Gonzales alluded to about 300 rent stabilized units that we currently are building right now in the first District. Every time we build a project like on Anaheim in PCH or senior or low income senior housing or expand like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we just did 120 units in West Long Beach by the villages of Cabrillo. We are expanding that rent stabilized number from, you know, 6000 to 60 500 to 7000 and higher. And so what I hope is while there is disagreement whether rent control actually works or causes disinvestment in housing production, which I believe a lot of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'research does, does lead us to, I hope we can I hope we can all agree that housing production and expanding rent stabilized units is beneficial to everyone in the city of Long Beach. And I and I would think that whether you're a property owner or whether you are an advocate or a tenant wants to see us, look'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at how do we increase the amount of rent stabilized units that we have for seniors, low income families and so forth. And I believe you do that by focusing strongly on production in addition to that. I want to just make sure and when we when we come back with this is the more information that we have on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these units, these units that have existed for decades in Long Beach have covenants on them. And we've worked really hard this the city has invested millions and millions of dollars on keeping these units, had to have actual covenants.'",

We sat in our first city meeting and for me it was absolutely horrible because I heard about an organization that was out of alignment with the city, ABC guidelines, etc. because our festival was primarily supported by volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The volunteers didn't have a stake in whether or not they did things right or wrong. And as a result, it kind of tarnished the name of Long Beach Pride. So for whatever reason, I got dubbed that person to come and be a part of Long Beach Pride and fix it.'",

We went from a meeting where people glared at you to a meeting where we can now hug. But the first time we held a meeting at Long Beach Pride versus the Convention Center or at special events and filming.'",

I think we have a unique opportunity in front of us, as this organization has had to move from pretty much a mom and pop type of thing.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'However, we are bound by the level of talent that's within the organization. So we had questions in regards to why do we use so many consultants? Well, the primary reason why we had to do that is because we didn't have the talent within the organization to do some of the duties that were required of us to do'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We didn't have someone who could do festival setup. We didn't have someone who could do parade. Right now, we struggle with we're slow to get talent and even slower to do marketing in order to put that information out to the community.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I've always been impressed with the outreach to all communities, but especially with the gay community population. I received my my first mailing from AARP. You know, when you turn 50, you get that. I thought that 23 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, 23 years ago, I got that. But I guess I want to bring out the fact that there are so many challenges that crop up as you age. Some of you may already know that. I don't know. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but I've also found that getting old is not not for sissies in any community. It takes guts. It takes determination to weather the storms as you would begin to age. I'm a good example of that. But Long Beach has always been the pride.'",

Misappropriation of charitable funds and gross mismanagement of the organization, including failing to perform background checks and live scan of its members and volunteers. Violations of codes of ethics and other statutes.'",

Engaging in a pattern of collusion in awarding special favors and lucrative final financial contracts to the field. Representatives of high ranking public officials such as Tanya martin, the field representative for State, Senator Ricardo Lara.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Ms.. Martin alone has received over $100,000 from Pride in the past few years. Additional lucrative contracts have been awarded to other friends of Pride's current administration, some of whom are unlicensed or unqualified to perform the task for which they were paid.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And. There. I felt in myself. I felt God was saying it's being flown because now it is time for the religious community to openly address the issue. That is why the flag is being flown. So since the flight, I don't know if it's still up, but since it was flown when it was last when I was last'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It had no sexual connotation whatsoever. It means the state of being happy. Like I'm gay to be here tonight. I'm not gay that it is going on 1:00. But I'm gay to be here tonight. To know how someone pleasures their sexual partner is none of my concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To have a flag flown in that regard. I could say let's fly a flag for all people who are menopausal. Let's have a menopausal flag. That we're having to have a discussion of that. I like people. God likes people.'",

And this past year, although Long Beach Pride did not give any of the community organizations a grant, I was fortunate enough to be the recipient of the scholarship for the last two years'",
        "'speaker_4': ', and it's because of Long Beach pride that I'm thriving. I will be graduating June 7th from Long Beach City College and I am going to be attending Cornell University in the fall.

        "'speaker_6': 'Are you paying too much for things that you could be saving money on? Are there vendors that you could be using that would ultimately result in your costs being less? So I really would hope that staff could come to the table and give us some honest feedback regarding some efficiencies so that we can move forward in that'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And I think we need to be mindful that when we do something special for one organization, we have to be willing, ethically and morally to do the same for everybody else. So what I don't want to do is enter into kind of a slippery slope where there's an expectation that year after year we're going to be subsidizing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or helping or there's an expectation because I think what we could really do is maybe this is the year, what we get on track, figure out what the efficiencies are, and maybe change some things in the model that allows us to have better results in terms of our financial status after the parade.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's what I'm really.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Helpful for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think this is a great opportunity to do that. I also think that so there's so you know, I have two parades in my district and they don't receive any city subsidy. And I know it's always stressful for the organizers of that event.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have to run things so efficiently to make sure that they don't come out in the red. And so maybe even talking with other event program organizers to find out, you know, what is it that they do? How can we learn some of those backpack best practices?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, you've probably already done that, but if not, that's something I would recommend because I know for them it's always to the penny what they've budgeted. So so I'm in favor of of using this year as a time to figure out what efficiencies can be made and seeing what we can do to help.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will say one thing, since I have you all here last year there were some amazing concerts that happened very late at night. In fact, they were so amazing that on the eastern most part of the city, our windows were rattling because the concert vibration was heard on the east side of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was. And I was communicating with special events. They were actually there trying to turn down the noise. I don't know what happened, but when I was getting bombarded, it was it was a Sunday night, so kids were trying to go to sleep.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I kid you not. The windows in our house in Alamitos Heights were rattling. We were getting text messages from residents all over the city on the east side. It was on next door dot com. Everybody was saying, what is going on?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We couldn't figure out. It sounded like the concert was at Rec Park, which was down the street from our house. So kudos to you for maximizing the volume of efficiencies. But please, please, if we're truly going to have a partnership, I think after such a beautiful weekend of pride activities, it was such a negative way to end'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that weekend. And so I asked you guys to please if we can be mindful of that partnership. But, you know, I love the event. My my staff and I participate. We have a fantastic time. Anything that we can do to help you guys keep this going, you've expanded it to a new level.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now you have a new norm. And that new norm is going to. Evolve a new model, a new business model. So I thank you for being here, for allowing me to say my piece. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Bianca.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. My first pride parade was back in 1990. I was the recruitment officer for the city of Long Beach at that time. And I asked the the organizers if I could have an information booth at the actual events park to try to recruit knowledge, recruiting police officers and firefighters at the time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they were so welcoming. I did have some difficulty at that time to get some firefighters and police officers to join me, because at that time it wasn't an acceptable. Acceptable, except it's late, acceptable, acceptable, I think, to accept it or to come out at that time so that that didn't happen till later.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I see this parade and this event as one that is has been breaking barriers for for a long time. And it seems like every time that that comes forward, there's something new that's being presented or being and another barrier is coming down is being broken.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm I'm very supportive of this. And that's why I signed on to it, because I think it's it's an event that needs to be sustained, that we need to continue. And if the partnership with the city would make it all that much better.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And and, you know, to a casual woman, prices are concerns. We probably do need to work together and and create those parameters that we can all work together within. So, I mean, I'm very supportive of this and I look forward to working further with gay pride.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And I appreciate the item coming forward. You know, 35 years, something is working. The pride parade has grown every year and become more and more of a, I think, exciting event. I think because it is a volunteer organization, you're going to have some natural challenges with with that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, I'm glad that we're having this conversation because I think we can the city can the council offices can be of assistance to to making sure that there is a consistency. Right. When you have elected nonprofit boards.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Information is lost. Often times the leadership changes and organizational changes. I know for a fact that some of the people who were very involved in planning this parade are no longer with us. And they were they were key key to key actors in the in the planning process, you know, over the years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I understand that hearing the the public comment understand that there are challenges within the organization. But I got to tell you, each and every year, it doesn't show, you know, and oftentimes, you know, those challenges are very, very painstaking when when you're actually planning an event.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But from the outside looking in, if you're not involved in the nuts and bolts, I think most of us appreciate, you know, the experience that pride provides everybody year after year after year. And so to those involved in the Pride organization, I just would salute you for the the dedication that you have put forth, understanding that it'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is a volunteer organization. And, you know, nobody's or most of you aren't getting paid to do the work that you do. And I'm glad that Councilmember Pearce brought forth some some more recommendations that I can certainly support this evening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I will just to say that I think it's it's really good if our city auditor can get involved and provide some some guidance. I mean, many of our our departments are run a lot better because of her, her hard work and her eagle eye.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And inside of our department, they can give you some best practices and practices and ideas on, you know, how to make the pride parade more efficient, but also ensure that I think the operations are more standardized and that hopefully, you know, we can we can celebrate, you know, 50 years in another 15 years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So with that, I'll be happy to support item Councilmember Silvano.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You for staying up late.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And Councilmember Andrews and I talk about this all the time. There's not too many shots of the fourth District or sixth District in citywide video. So thank you for that. And also, I know you reached out to our office recently and please continue to do that if we can help in any way.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It's a good parade. We want to see it indoors. Got a great legacy in the city. So we want to want to do whatever we can to do that. And that also goes to the broader conversation around, you know, last year, the big issue was the Veterans Day parade and special events.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were able to figure out some ways to improve it and make it better. And so I see a good future there. And so if that's what this year is for the pride parade, then then I encourage a lot of cooperation to figure out how you can get to the next I mean, how many years?'",
