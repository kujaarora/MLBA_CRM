        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We're going to go ahead and begin with our hearings. We have two hearings. Two will be done first. And if you want to read the first hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and find the project within the scope of the Pacific Center. IIR Addendum and Declare Ordinance Amending Table two of the Douglas Park Plan Development District 32 North Development Standards related to the regulation of off premises alcohol sales uses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Read the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting for Final Reading District five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. If I can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please have our city staff take the hearing away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We carry tie current planning officer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Linda Tatum, planning bureau manager. We're doing a presentation tonight for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and members of the city council. Before you tonight is the zoning code amendment regarding the sale of alcohol for offsite consumption in PD 32 North, otherwise known as the north portion of Douglas Park. This is working on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here we go. So on the map, on the screen shows the boundary of the northern half of Douglas Park, and that's Lakewood. The boundaries are Lakewood Boulevard on the top cover street to the south and then to the east of I'm sorry, Carson Street on the north Lakewood Boulevard on the western boundary, and then Cover Street on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the south. And that sub area, one of P.D. 32 north, is the area that this zoning code amendment would affect, and that is highlighted in red on the screen. It's otherwise it's sub area one and it is coterminous with the site boundaries of the new L.B. ex retail development that is being constructed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there are certain stores that have opened already. So just some background. When PD 32 was first adopted and the this was during the conversion of the Boeing uses to the new Douglas Park light industrial uses and then later on and later on as amended, the it was unclear as to what the configuration of the retail uses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'would be. And therefore PD 32 started off with a blanket prohibition on the off premises alcohol sales. That is not the same case with PD 32 South, which is where the hotels are and the existing some of the existing commercial developments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is an area that simply does not even allow people to apply for the sale of alcohol, for offsite consumption. And that is inconsistent with every other retail zone in the entire city. And I did mention that this is the site of the Long Beach Exchange, L.B. X retail development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a shopping center of over 260,000 square feet that is currently being constructed. There is a pretty large tenant mix, but one of the anchors is a 28,000 square foot Whole Foods 365. It's a grocery store. And based on today's zoning, this grocery store would not be able to sell any alcohol for offsite consumption.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And grocery stores all over the city typically do provide that service, and it's part of the products that grocery stores are able to provide. So the proposed zoning code amendment for PD 32 would allow for alcohol sales in sub area one only of PD 32 North with a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a same as the other commercial zones in the city, and also certain businesses would also will be eligible for the city's conditional use permit exemption process, which extends the exemption for getting a conditional use permit to certain businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And some of those businesses include supermarkets that are over 20,000 square feet, restaurants that serve food, that don't have a fixed bar, department stores or florists that sell wine and a few others. So I should note that this sub area does currently allow the sale of alcohol for on site consumption, provided that the business obtains a conditional'",
        "'speaker_2': 'use permit. The proposed amendment would make the process of permitting alcohol sales in this sub area one the same as other areas that allow retail uses. This also allows for requests for off sale of alcohol. Go through the Planning Commission process, where the Planning Commission may evaluate the request on a case by case basis, and that is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the same as with other locations in the city. The Planning Commission heard this item on February 15th and voted unanimously to recommend that the City Council adopt this amendment to PD 32. With that staff is that's a staff report and we can answer any questions you have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is any public comment on this item in an environment that you would like to speak on?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So last step, of course. And so speaking on behalf of Grassroots Government Services, LLC, last year I tried to put a dispensary in this particular area and was told that I could not do so because of a development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because of development give. For me, it created a green space that was within, I believe, 1500 feet of this of this particular development, thus knocking it out with really funny. Now, as I'm finding out that you're trying to put a Whole Foods that sells alcohol in this particular area, unlike, say, my clients, my dispensary workers who would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have been unionized, you have CW members of the CW you're trying to put in. People are going to be just. Beating alcohol, a drug that kills 50,000 people a year. Instead of priority. Instead of allowing my particular business, which has a body count of zero.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So just want that to be heard by the council. Thank you. Fine. Okay, Mr. Monk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. You'd mentioned that the process is going forward. Should this be approved, would be streamlined, would there still be opportunities? Should the violations come without the CFP that those businesses and their permits would be able to be rolled back?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, thank you for your question, Councilwoman. Woman Mongo. Yes. In addition to any local regulations, the sale of alcohol is regulated by the California Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control. And so there would be the same criteria that the state criteria for anyone to have, for anyone to have an alcohol license.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Furthermore, the exemption to the conditional use permit process does come with operational criteria that businesses must operate under, and therefore, if they are in violation of that, that is cause for us to essentially remove that as well. There's also recently been a trend of a request for a variance to the ABC permitting where people can sell single'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bottles of beer. Are we clear on whether or not this form of exemption allows for that or not, or if that would be a separate process? As the IPA craft beer world has gotten more creative, this has become a higher demand and I've heard a lot of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thank you for your question. So the so the off sale of alcohol for offsite consumption, if it does not require a local conditional use permit, would allow for single sales of craft craft beer, if you will, because it's exempt from a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It doesn't is does not have a local criteria. However, if you have certain if you have any uses that proposed the sale of alcohol for offsite consumption, that is subject to the conditional use permit. The city does have the ability to condition the business so that they cannot do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so there's a if it's a local regulation, we can control that. However, the state regulations do allow for single sales. Wonderful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Chippenham.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I stand in support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm not sure if public comment was called for this hearing at him yet. It was. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we we already did the.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening again. Before you as a general plan amendment item A for the area generally around the intersection of Pine Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway. On the screen, on the map is the boundaries of the existing Midtown specific plan area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is a little red circle around the area that we will be discussing tonight. In terms of some background, the midtown specific plan was adopted by the City Council in 2016 and it generally allows for mixed uses, in other words, commercial and non-GAAP residential and nonresidential uses located in the same building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, the underlying general plan designations at that time were not updated because it was anticipated that they would be done with the Comprehensive General Plan Amendment. However, there are and have been a series of development proposals for mixed use projects, and therefore we are asking for this a general plan amendment tonight to clean up this situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the purple area on the screen highlights that area that was circled in red. And and this is the scope of the general plan amendment. There is a smaller yellow dotted square that is the site of a pending site plan review application for a mixed use project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then just that that project is a has about 3500 square feet of commercial space and 24 residential units. While it is while it would be allowed under today's Midtown specific plan, it is not allowed under the underlying general plan designation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the requested general plan amendment would be to change the underlying designations to elude land use designation number seven, which is mixed uses. So currently on the screen, the area zoned as purple was the same one that was on the aerial.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is designated as land use designations eight end, which is shopping nodes eight P, which is pedestrian oriented retail strip A which is a traditional retail strip commercial. And those are all commercial only designations. And also portion of it is three B, which is only residential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the change to allowed seven would allow for mixed uses in accordance with the Midtown specific plan. There is also an orange strip on the screen and that area is not within the midtown specific plan. However, changing the purple area would leave an isolated strip of a it's a it's a land use designation at a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so rather than doing that, we are proposing to change that to a3b, which is moderate density residential, and that comports with the underlying land uses that are currently on the ground today. So on the screen is the is a rendering of that site plan review project that I mentioned that, you know, would need this general plan'",

Basically, the this type of a project effectuate the vision that the Midtown specific plan has and creates a new investment, commercial and residential opportunities in the Midtown Specific Plan area. This matter for the General Plan Amendment was considered by the Planning Commission on March 1st.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Planning Commission found that the required findings for a general plan can be made in favor of this general plan amendment and also acknowledged that effectuating the Midtown specific plan, a vision would allow for the reinvestment that the city the city anticipated the project has with public notice, and the staff received several inquiries but no other opposition'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Lastly, an addendum to the Midtown Specific Plan Environmental Impact Report was prepared to analyze this project and found that changing the general plan designations to comport with the Midtown specific plan zoning would not have any additional environmental impacts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Therefore, a staff recommends that the City Council and Act to the Planning Commission recommendation to approve the addendum for this action, as well as approve the General Plan Amendment itself. Thank you. And that concludes staff's presentation.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'First of all, I'd like to thank the staff for their great work and input throughout this process. You know, the general plan amendment creates consistency between Midtown Special Plans and current general plans and has opened up the areas to the development, fitting our own change in our behavior.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to thank the Medusa as a best of both worlds, because it brings the difference between us and one site. Acknowledging that the proposal for the two parishes at Pine and PCH was traditionally a strip strip mall, which has since involved into a mixed use residential project which commercial space on the ground floor.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So many families across California live paycheck by paycheck and stagnant wages, high costs of housing, childcare, other financial strains contribute this problem. Unfortunately, some lenders see this despair as an opportunity to trap borrowers into high cost loans, with exorbitant interest rates that far too often lead them into financial ruin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Payday lenders and other loan sharks disproportionately target low income communities that are really struggling to make ends meet. Currently, California law does not have a limit on NPR that lenders could charge on loans between 20 $510,000. So that's why that's where we see most of the predatory lending taking place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A 2016 annual report by the California Business Department of Business Oversight found that 58% of loans between 20 $510,000 had appeared of 100% or higher, with 25% of those being upwards of 300% APR.
