        "'speaker_8': 'We could get tremendous support from the Marine patrols and in previous years, we never had to pay. For the at a commercial rate, and I would suggest the council revisit that. Again, we're talking only about the events that are the not for profit high school and junior high kids and Cal State.'",

There was a specific item in the airport section about the legend's restaurant and potentially renting it out. I've had some questions with city staff and there's some questions from the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So at this time, what I'd like to request to get some refinement and make sure that we know what we're doing on all the airport related fees. If we could pull those out and bring those back in six months once we have some more details.'",

So it would be the the adding the lighting and then the wattage as well would be two different fees, is that correct?'",

        "'speaker_6': 'No, no, no. Charging on holidays and weekends, some weekends. Could we look at maybe not charging on Easter Sunday?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So actually, I can't remember. We used to not charge on certain Sundays and now citywide we do charge on Sundays. We actually, in the municipal code have a list of certain holidays that are considered official city holidays that we do not charge on Easter is not one of those that the city council has in the past defined'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as a as a city holiday. So that's something that the city could do through an ordinance change, obviously, with the addition of the city attorney. And then there would just be a revenue impact for doing that. But we try very, very hard to explain that to people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's been much better now that we can actually write it on the meter itself. We did have a number of of miscommunication with people who believe that that was a city holiday who did not get that information.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're going to look into it and report back in terms of whether it be possible or not. I know we're not supposed to mix religion and state affairs, but I think it would be worth at least studying it.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'My understanding as of yesterday that he would go up to 40 $100 because we're going to accommodate the cost of electricity. The numbers you just quoted earlier, I don't think we're in line with that. Or maybe I'm just not hearing them.'",
