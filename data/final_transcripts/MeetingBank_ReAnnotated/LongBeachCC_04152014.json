        "'speaker_3': 'I think many of you've probably been there along the eastern side of the Performing Arts Center and can be a bit inconspicuous to the passer by and even those attending the performance. So it could use some improvements to its entrance and make it more inviting and safer for pedestrians.'",

My experience is, one, a process that I think in general we should in the budget process, talk about all the products for the upcoming year and have that discussion as opposed to an ad hoc allocation.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And if they're going to be doing that, this project will take 2 to 3 years. So I think we need to micro-manage how that's being done. Again, go down to the that new restaurant. The city has done a nice job in maintaining the original the core.'",

W Partners, exchanging a portion of the public service yard for a portion of the low street US wetlands as a condition of the exchange.'",

Additionally, both parties were obligated to work cooperatively to minimize the other parties exposure to remediation costs. At the time of the exchange, environmental remediation costs for the public service yard were estimated at $2,853,300.'",

However, during grading, it was discovered that the debris had been systematically burned, resulting in lead based paint being spread laterally throughout the property.'",

Instead of transporting the debris off site, we intend to instead consolidate the debris on the northerly 1.8 acres of the 5.2 acre site, and then reacquire that site in order to control any future environmental issues.'",

First of all, in the backup information, there is no map of the site which shows where the north portion is either the five point something acres or the one point something acres.'",

That's not clear. Third, the staff mentions that the letters, acquisition costs and temporary holding costs of this property equal the value of the north portion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But there's nothing to substantiate that. There's no fair market valuation of the property or any other evaluation of the property and staff refunds that that portion of Lear's payment to purchase the property be refunded without question as to whether its initial purchase price was reliable or whether and made any sense.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Fourth and almost last of the staff changes the original sense of minimizing environmental liability to actually eliminating any environmental liability. And it's an overreach of the original agreement's intent. And finally, will the portion that one point something acre is it's going to be capped at this point be of any use to the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is there any access by the city to it or preparations to operate that access? Or will Alere use it in some way or another as any agreement to that effect at all?

They are preparing a report for us that hopefully we'll have in the next few days that actually lays out a plan for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. My next question is in regard to the language line and you laid out where we were. Now, the languages that are being used on the language line pilot are what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are, Tagalog, Spanish and Kami.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I think originally our goal was was the language line was to be a catch all. And that is. And how long will the pilot last for the pilots?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Going to last for six months. Yeah, and I did. I must say that I did read your motion and I did ask the table and I. I apologize if I didn't get that correct, although I think I did.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think I think we're on the right track and we can address this and move forward again. I commend you for the work that you've done. This is a very fluid policy. And as you stated, it's going to take some time to get from where we were to, you know, ultimately where we need to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I commend you on the work that you've already done, though. And I had another question in regard to voice mails. Now, have we gotten to the point where voice mails are the major department? There is an option if Spanish press one, or have we gotten to that point?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I know that the several city departments, councilman that I mentioned do have that for Spanish press one. The English the message starts in English. And then it's just sort of like when you call 411, get that to it in the Spanish language, press one if that's what you want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then from. So what about the Combi and Tagalog have we have we know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I stated in my report, lacking of funding has not allowed all departments to do that or really any departments. So I think that if we were to fund part or some of this, we would make sure that all departments had all the languages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's actually more expensive than you think to make those recordings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, could you explain to me why that is cost prohibitive at this time to to do the recordings in the different departments?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why it's cost prohibitive. It's I don't have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess it's for the is in regard to the follow up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. That's that's where I was going. I don't have it right in front of me. The initial putting together of the script and then the reading and the rereading and the checking of the script is all something that is done once.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But then the follow up is what actually gets expensive and who follows up and and additional staffing needed for those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what are the plans to move forward in that area? Have have we talked about that or is there a roadmap on how we get to that point?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Millett Neal, I think that's one of the more difficult ones that we're grappling with. So we're trying to deal with those issues within the policy that we know we can implement more quickly. And so we have been focusing on those.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As you know, we are going to be required to be reporting on a regular basis. We are not able to give you a timeline yet on what it would take for us to do that. We currently do have a couple of departments that have recorded messages in English and Spanish.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is currently in place. Now we would have to identify those departments that do have recorded messages and the value of of converting those into different languages. And then again, the follow up. So that would be on a department by department basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would not be something that would be easily rolled out citywide all at once.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Well, I would like to hear from my colleagues on the air. I have an idea that possibly and I'm sure the next council will have to deal with this, maybe there would be some one time use to help convert this and move this along.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I would like to hear from some of my colleagues before I come back and address this concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Andrews. Yes, thank you. I'd like to thank you, Councilman Neal, for really going and asking the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Questions, which you did, because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, it was November 2011 that it was first brought this item to the City Council to address the needs of inclusive language, access, policy and honor the true diversity of our city. The process has been a long one indeed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, for the last three years, we have had a lot of discussions with the community. We have approached many organizations and explained that the policies involve evolving one. Today we have another great step in front of us to access in this evolution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This includes the reflections of the Language Lion Policy Program on the upcoming city budget. And I would.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Like to move to receive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A move and receive involved with this. I just wish that it came a little earlier because, in fact, it could have been in last year's budget, but it will be in this year's budget. And I think we we're working very hard to make sure that this is done right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'd like to thank all the people who are coming out tonight to address this issue. And thank you. Okay. There's a there's been a motion to receive and file. Is there a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second? Actually, I don't believe that's. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, yeah. I'm going to have you next year. Okay, so there's a motion on the floor. Councilmember Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I have a couple of questions. Councilman Andrew's motion was to receive and file. Correct. This is just a status update. There's no action that's requested. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So just a couple of questions I have along the lines of Councilmember Neal, and I appreciate that those questions were raised. One item that I did not hear about and if it was mentioned during previous council meetings, I apologize for the redundancy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have we looked at Google Translate for our website? Councilmember. Yes, we have. And we've actually piloted that in neighborhood services a year or two ago. And for actually document translation, it's still not quite perfected. So if you say put an English document in and ask it to translate it in Spanish, and then you have somebody who speaks'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Spanish and writes and read Spanish, read it, it's not always correct. So I, I would like to request that we actually look at it as a very low cost, sort of a stopgap measure. I realize it's not perfect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does offer 44 languages and I use it at my transit agency in the city of Santa monica. The only caveat is if your website is very graphic based as opposed to text based, that's difficult to translate. And so we'd have to look at our website to be sure that some of those what appears as text is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'actually text as opposed to graphic. But it is I do think that the community can acknowledge and forgive that in a in a stopgap phase, that it's not perfection, but it's something in 44 languages through such a simple tool is something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my public agency in Santa monica did it. I made that decision overnight and did it. And it's very useful and I think that would be useful here. We can't forgo the good for the perfect. I'd like us to be at a good place while we're working toward perfection.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Lowenthal We can definitely try it. We can try it again. And then in our next six month update, we can let you know what we've done with it and and that type of thing. And if, you know, if we stay away from sort of the legal documents, but just public information, I think what people are looking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for is to be able to participate in government and have access to basic public information. And so the vital documents are clearly important, and there are advocates in the community that can help individuals with vital documents. But when it comes to just public information, where we don't always want to have to work with translators or advocates through'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Legal Aid Foundation because their resources are limited, I think, just for that basic information. So. Mr. City Manager I'd like to actually see that as opposed to just neighborhood services, to our master website, our home page, and allow people access to basic information.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. I'm going to turn over to Amy for a second. Was this discussed with the group? To go to Google.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, it was not. We would obviously talk to tech services as well because we are in the process of updating the entire city website as well. So we can certainly talk to tech services.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we'll get back to you immediately, but that will be our attempt to do that for the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And I know Councilman Andrew. So Councilmember Neil's raised the issue about using children as translators. And just from my years of working in domestic violence, there are issues that are very sensitive that we don't bring our own children into those conversations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to do so because we have a language barrier is really violating our really our charge to children in general. And so I would want us to be very careful about that and not suggest that it would be okay because of cost limitations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Johnson Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Well, first, I want to thank all the advocates who worked so hard to get us where we're at today and also staff. I think we have made some progress. Clearly, we have some more to go, but that's what continuous improvements all about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What they were here taught me so many years ago that in government we seek to continually improve as a great management tool. My thoughts are, it sounds like what we need to do is help management get the job done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so perhaps this should be part of our upcoming budget. And I guess my question to you, Mr. City Manager, is, are there some low hanging fruit? Maybe not everything here, but a couple key things that might move us a little bit further forward that we may see as part of the budget and obviously haven't done it'",
        "'speaker_7': 'yet. But is that something you'll be contemplating and presenting as a budget in the coming months? Councilmember Vice Mayor We certainly will be looking at that low hanging fruit. I think that Google applications is a low hanging fruit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know that's very inexpensive, but we'll also be listening to what the council gives us tonight or with the audience, and we'll bring that forward on a budget and cost it out. Okay. Well, thank you. It's the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think. I do appreciate your fiscal prudence and I do think mid budget year it's challenging, but I think it's part of the budget process. If there are some core documents that we can have translated, certainly it's not feasible to have every document translated, but there are some key documents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Maybe that community can help us understand what those are. I think we would show some good faith to the community to move the ball forward, even if, as Ms.. Lowenthal said, you know, we shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thanks to everyone staff and advocates for the progress we made and look forward to making more progress.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I was just going to comment. This could be this could be built in as a component of the new website potentially. What is that coming? I know that's a couple of years late, but. That's why I don't believe it's a couple of years away.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As you know, we had until late. Oh, a couple of years late? No, I believe it's a few months late. Basically, we had some funding issues. We found the funding. We had some software issues. And I believe I don't see Curtis in the audience, but I think maybe you can get the word out to me seven from'",
        "'speaker_7': 'now. Sure. You know, it's a short, a long time, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm going to open up to public comment on the item. There is a motion on the floor. If there's any members of the public that want to speak, please come forward. As you speak, please identify yourself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the record.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We witnessed instead of this Miembros Zircon Salesman nominated Gary Shelton BPO in Premiere Distrito. You can see other lists in the Omega Usado. And we are squealer and we trabajo tambin. Emile God durante los ultimos anos. But I won't do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What I'd like to say is I only came down because of the mention of Google Translate. And I appreciate what you're saying, Councilmember Lowenthal, but it is insulting the way Google translate translate things. If it were to be used, it would need editing for every utilization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I commend the council member from the seventh District when when he was first in office or sometime shortly after he decided to use Google Translate for his city council website page. And the first time that it was used, it was attempting to make the announcement that there would be a meeting for the seventh District on the city'",
        "'speaker_7': 'budget. But what it said in Spanish was that it was going to have the seventh meeting on the district budget. Pretty simple information for the public to not even understand what they really mean. They might want to go to that meeting, but it wouldn't be what they were expecting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So with all due respect, I would say leave Google translate out of it unless you have good copy editing to follow up on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Honorable City Council members, city staff and all the community residents who came out today. My name is Alex, Montano says. I'm with the Filipino Migrant Center and I live in the first district here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Once again, you know, I'm representing the Long Beach Language Access Coalition here, which is a whole bunch of different community organizations, individuals and grassroots groups who are really trying to make sure that there is language accessibility here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We want to congratulate and commend all of you, all of the city council members, the city staffers, everybody, the community residents who have all come together to make sure this thing was passed. It really was a historic thing that the Long Beach language access policy was passed back in August.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And really, there aren't that many cities who have something as progressive as this. And also part of that really is the compliance hearing that was part of this policy, not only for accountability, but also to make sure that we can improve upon the policy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. I'm not only how far we've gone, but also how much further can we go? Not only can we do it, but how much better can we do it right? And so that's why at least the Language Access Coalition decided to bring in our community residents to help with this process, to give their input.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's what we did a language access test of the language access services here in the city from January to March of this year. And we did find that there are several things that do need to be improved, which came out in our status report and all of our different community members will be attesting to what those'",
        "'speaker_7': 'things are. But based upon those findings of the things that we feel need to be improved, we came up with these several recommendations. But number one is to fully implement and fund the policy as directed by the Council last August to include Spanish, Carmine and Tagalog on those main voicemail messages to make sure that there is training'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for staff on how to speak to limited English proficient speakers and how to work with interpreters to make sure there are translated by vital documents in Spanish, Kumai and Tagalog, and to make sure there is a clear plan for bilingual hiring goals, especially for Kami and Tagalog, to make sure that that language line pilot program can be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'used for all those languages, not just Spanish, come on in Tagalog. And to make it very explicit, to limit the use of children as interpreters, to just emergency situations, to allocate those necessary funds for the ongoing implementation of the policy and set a clear timeline for the biannual or quarterly compliance hearings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so for us, we really feel that, you know, I know that we all here really value the diversity here on our city here in Long Beach. And I think that when we can fully implement this policy, that's where all of us, all of our diverse residents can truly say, I am from Long Beach and my voice'",
        "'speaker_7': 'matters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. My name is Laura Merrifield and I'm a second district resident. I'm also representing Building Healthy Communities and the Language Access Coalition, which I've been part of for about two years now. And first off, I really would like to thank the Council for their hard work, for their leadership in adopting this policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, and I'm like Council Member Johnson's, you know, commended the progress of us being here tonight. And I myself am happy that we are here at this point where we're talking about a policy that has already been passed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's, you know, something I'm very happy about. And I'd also like to thank the staff for the work they've done in implementing it so far. I am here to talk about some of the concerns our coalition had regarding some of the policy items, the things that we feel still could use some improvement as we move forward'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with this policy and its actualities. For residents like Laquan Kim, who are using this every day, the biggest I mean, one thing for us, again, is the language line pilot program. Our understanding that is in this full language access policy that covers Spanish, come on in Tagalog, that language line is a catchall for those languages, not already'",
        "'speaker_6': 'included. And I think that as the policy aims to be fully in place, language line will be broader than just those four languages. So we would encourage looking in to having all languages covered by a supplemental program like that, not just the ones that would already be within staffing means again on the translation of vital documents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was another concern of ours that these documents largely have not been translated. And I think there's most likely ways to look into translating the ones that our community really is using. And besides just meetings in minutes, you know, those those forms, documents, brochures, most access by our community members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also, you know, think that it's very important to have training for staff and and to have our staff be aware of how to interact with interpreters, but also even staff who are not bilingual, how they can properly work with our limited English proficient community members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's great to hear that some training is already going, but we encourage, you know, to keep working with our staff, to really be friendly representatives to our community members. Another concern is, again, that's been echoed several times is the use of children as interpreters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We still think that if the city has this has is saying that it's something they strive not to do. We feel like that can be put into policy. Again, we just want to make sure we have an update on our but we make sure we have all our bilingual staff and we set goals for that and that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we have a clear timeline for how this policy will continue into the future. And finally, budget is a large thing that's pressing over us. And, you know, we want to make sure that the funds are in place for the full implementation of the policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so those were our overall concerns. But we're here to work to make this actually a real living policy for our residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. My name is Steve SIM. I'm a staff attorney at Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. I'm also a member of the Long Beach Language Access Coalition. I'm also a resident of Long Beach and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The eighth District.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I am a Cambodian American. I you know, I was born in the refugee camps. I came to Long Beach every weekend whether I wanted to or not, from the San Fernando Valley. And I also speak Spanish. So and I deal with work with a lot of low income clients in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm well aware of a lot of the issues and the vital documents that need to be translated for many of our community members. I just passed around the compliance report. I just want to highlight a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we did have 100 tests, 110 tests conducted by LRP residents, and those were mainly by walk in I'm sorry, by phone calls, because for many of our residents, to walk into a city agency is something that's very hard for them because they're aware of the stories where there's no one there that can they can understand them'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And these were in the following departments Health Department, Utilities, Housing and Neighborhood Services. And some of our key findings were that more than half of our residents weren't getting connected to bilingual staffers. That's that's an alarming number for us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you have a 50% chance of going in there, you have a problem with your utility bills and not getting any service. And that for many of us, we access many when we have a problem, we usually call a number.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's an automated system. It's very rare that you talk to a live individual and for most of the voicemail services weren't translated. And some of the, the, the, the agencies that were translated that had Spanish. Perhaps those translations predated the language access policy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think to this date, I don't think there has been any new translations for any of our city services. And if they were able to access. Well, I want to take your attention to really briefly just one of the charts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. 56 out of our 109 respondents did not get access to a bilingual staff member. And when they were connected to the voicemail, most of them did not get appropriate or useful information because it wasn't translated in their language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in terms of remedies that we can take in this fiscal cycle would be the implementation of language line and using whatever discretionary funds are available for training of staff. Definitely working with our LRP residents, it's not just it's about money, but it's also just having the right attitude and the right state of mind that we're not'",
        "'speaker_5': 'going to turn anyone away. It doesn't matter what language they speak. They're a resident of Long Beach and their voice matters. All right. Thank you.'",

But I'm also here as the Coalition for Good Jobs and a Healthy Community. I think, like my colleagues here have said, that we live in a city that's, you know, full of people with diverse backgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And today, as city leaders, you know, you have a key opportunity to send a message to residents, to let them know that we welcome and encourage monolingual speakers to utilize these public services, be strong civic participants in the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just wanted to let you know why the Coalition is in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Support of the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Recommendations that have been raised by the Language Access Coalition. We know that 83% of hotel workers here are actual residents here in our city, many of them speaking both Spanish and Tagalog.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's vital for workers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To feel welcome and respected and also understood when they're using public services or when they're trying to come to public hearings like this. And we want to.'",

        "'speaker_7': '. Based on that review, a projection was done by the consultants of the amount of money that could be borrowed from the Marina Fund. And what I'll be representing tonight is based on that report. Slip fee increases are very important because most of the revenue from the Marina Fund, which pays for the rebuild, that's where the money comes'",
        "'speaker_7': 'from. Slip fee rate increases dictate how much money is going to be available for the ABM rebuild and how much we can borrow. The options we looked at and our consultants looked at include included going an ongoing 2% slip fee increases combined with various types of other increases, including 3% increases until market levels are reached.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that was looked at because the current slip fee rates are somewhat below the market in this area. However, regardless of the slip fee rates that we use, the marina does not have the ability to support enough debt to finance the remaining ABM.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Rebuild costs that we just heard were about $60 million. So let's talk about the borrowing capacity of the marina. The consultants indicated that about 34 to $40 million can likely be borrowed by way of a bond issue, depending on the level of slip fee rate increases.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That leaves about 20 to $26 million. That must come from other sources, potentially in phases in order to achieve the current $60 million cost of the remaining waterside parts of the project. The bonds will also take about a year to issue because of the complexities of the financing and the fact that this is a very difficult market'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in which to sell these bonds. There is a possible role of the Tidelands Fund in solving this funding situation. Tidelands has received about $10.9 million from the marina over a number of years, primarily between 88 and 96. That could be returned.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That 10.9 million could be returned to the marina to help solve the funding problem. And as another point, it will take about 2 to 3 months to secure approval from the State Lands Commission, which were required to do for use of tidelands money for the ABM rebuild, if that's what council wishes to do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Overall, and just to wrap things up in terms of the timing and what can be done tonight, we have a request. The next item on the agenda from Parks, Recreation and Marine is to authorize $1.8 million from the Marina Fund, and it has that cash to continue ABM rebuild work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Staff will start immediately a process to engage consultants for a potential bond issue in June or July. This in just a couple of months from now, we expect to be able to secure State Lands Commission approval for use of tidelands funds at that time.'",
        "'speaker_7': '$10.9 million of council wishes can be made available from Tidelands for an APM rebuild in addition and work on Basin two can begin with that $10.9 million. Work will then continue on the bond issue and in the first half of 2015, Council could consider authorizing bonds, the slip fee rates and the balance of funding for the project'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Bonds could be sold based on those authorizations probably somewhere in April or May of 2015. And then the ABM rebuild could be continued and completed, and that is the end of staff's report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm going to move on to council comments. Councilman DeLong.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You see a couple of things. First of all, you talk about in the existing work that's been done, about $15.8 million has come out of the marina funds to date. Did we receive state lands approval for each of those expenditures?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't believe so. Those are marine enterprise funds. So they weren't Thailand's per se, but they were marina enterprise funds either.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I apologize. But, you know, sometimes we're told that it's all part of the Thailand fund and other times we're not. So we get conflicting information. Now, if you go with the theory that you've suggested here, that there $10.9 million is really marina funds.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not Thailand's funds, but it's paid back. Why would you need state lands approval for it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember The distinction is in part the revenue source where the money comes from. So the marina funds are basically generated out of the marina. Yes. And so the oil revenue is what state lands requires approval of. So whenever we're using oil revenue for any capital project over $100,000, we need state lands approval.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I guess what I heard was that the $10.9 million was originally marina funds. And now all we're doing is we're reimbursing the Marina Fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. But we're reimbursing it with oil revenue. That is for a specific capital project. So we will need state lands and as we've.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Indicated, it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Will occur in June. And and I, I don't think we want to put in jeopardy all of the other capital projects that we have in the pipeline by trying to avoid State Lands Commission, because they pay very close attention to what we're doing with the oil revenue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Got it. All right. Help me understand the dredging a little better that we've talked about, that after October 2015 will work at the Port of Long Beach. And I'm sure that port will be as cropped as they can.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what what are the potential pitfalls with that approach? Is it a done deal or are there things that could happen that would prevent that from occurring?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember We've already discussed this with the port and they have told us they've always worked with us, with our dredge material and they told us they'll be there for us at that period of time. No one can promise what's going to be happening at that period of time with measure with them, with their Middle Harbor project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But if they have the ability to take the dredge material, they certainly will. They've started. They've stated. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the $60 million total cost, how much of that is I guess, and what's the sequence? So we know you're recommending moving forward to face up to another 60 million. How much is associated basin to Councilmember Basin?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Two is about $26.9 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Got up since yesterday. How about it? And then this Basin three follow that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think it went up since yesterday. It was always 26.9. Basin three is 22.1 million. And then on those costs, I'm sorry. You include all the costs, not just bellingham's. Right. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'City manager and I had a conversation yesterday based on sex, and that would be the next one that you would go to. Yes. Okay. And with the cost of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That would be 6.7 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And based on seven.'",
        "'speaker_8': '1.6 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the drydock.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's $572,000.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the landside improvements after all this is done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, landside improvements would be a number of restrooms depending on when we do it. And escalation right now, I think, between landscaping and restrooms is about $18 million kind of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I see a city auditor here missed out every moment. How are you coming? Taking a look at the marina funds versus Thailand, the funds and how they've been used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're still working on it. We have received all the documents from city staff and we're analyzing all the information. We should be wrapping it up in a couple of weeks and give it back to city management.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Okay. Because that could help the bond issues as well as more more funds in the Marina Fund. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you. That's all the questions I have at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman O'Donnell. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. And I want to say.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just quickly, I appreciate staff's work on this, because basins two and three are definitely in need of work. And I think that's why some of the individuals are down here tonight. They well know as users of the marina that those spaces are absolutely in need.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's planks popping up. There is nails sticking up. It's not really a safe place to walk. And I know staff is doing their best to address those conditions, but ultimately it has to be replaced. So at that, just a couple of questions with the plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are just practical questions. But the the plan, we're not going to losing existing public dock space. What I mean is the temporary space when people pull up, etc., not necessarily the permanent folks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, we wouldn't be losing any dock space. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And can you just describe the small the small boat storage requirements are those for the dinghies that pretty much are already in existence on the dock or are they is there a requirement for small boat storage space elsewhere?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Actually, they're more for the 20 to 30 foot vessels. The industry is finding that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'People are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Trailering those in more than they are putting them in the water. It's cheaper to keep them on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Dry on the dry land. So Coastal is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Requiring that that we build some drive or storage.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's in addition to the dry storage located right off Marine Stadium. Yes. Really interesting. I actually I see that as a good thing because there does need to be a balance. We want people to vote. We want people in a marina.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not everybody can afford the slip fees because they are going up. I think we need to watch that, too. So with that, I turn it back to you, Mr. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Neal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. And in regard to your potential timing, under the June, July, the approval of the 10.9 million of titling funds, is that the only option that we have as a council at this body were not to choose that option?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is there a contingency plan or is this really the only option that we have, I guess is my question. Councilmember The original option was not to utilize tailings funds or general fund and we would go on perhaps a ten month hiatus waiting for the bond issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we have no plan B except to wait and wait when the bonds are issued by Mr. GROSS. The 40 the $40 million, we hope then we would kick start the marina, but it wouldn't be for about a year, so we would be taking a pause.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But this use of the Tidelands funds allow us to kick us into gear right away. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Captain Ballantyne.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I wanted to thank the individuals that have come out here tonight. I know you're just a small representation of the larger group of constituents that are interested in this. To start, I do want to thank you for coming up with a financing plan, and I appreciate the timeline for Bass in, too, but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really hope that we can get the remainder of the projects done as quickly as possible. In addition to the disrepair. I do think it's such a vital part of our history and the city's identity. I wanted to ask in terms of the timing, Mr. West, you just mentioned what the timing would be, the council's action tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How many subsequent actions would you have to come back for in order to ensure that this is on track? And I think you understand my concern here. You have very strong advocates on this council. I would hate for there to have to be a learning curve of sorts, because that would suggest that the community wait even longer'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so to keep this on path in a seamless way as possible, given what our diocese will look like in July. Is this all you need today to keep it on track?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. We're not tonight we're not looking for any action from the city council. We were asked to come up with the plan to go forward. This is our plan to utilize the $10.9 million. If there was an objection to that, we would like to hear that tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not hearing that. So our plan would be to go to the State Lands Commission in June. I think it's the second or third week of June. Hopefully they will approve this ten point million dollars, 10.9 million to go to basin to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will come back, I hope, in the first or second meeting in July with the City Council to appropriate the $10.9 million and enter into a contract for basin to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I appreciate that you don't need an action tonight, but I think you understand my concern. And so while you don't hear an objection, I want to be sure that the point of action is taken as early as possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This will be. The action from the Council will be the. First or second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Meeting and general.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Meeting in July as the first meeting we can get to. After that State Lands Commission meeting in May or June. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Any further council comment?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember DeLong And it was along the same side. What I would ask you, Mr. West, is, if at all possible, assuming state lands approves, it is to come back on the first Tuesday in July, the second Tuesday, a difficult meeting with what else is occurring.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that that would be our intention. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seeing no further council comment, do we have a motion on this yet? I believe we moved in second and already didn't. We move to designate problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So why don't we turn to the public and item number 23? Any members of the public wish to speak on item number 23?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mary, Judy Clarke has to address a number of issues. Number one, if I read the information correctly, part of this money is to pay Bellingham to stand by and wait because their contract apparently is if it was represented right ends and their contract is up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think we should pay anybody to stand by and wait. What we say to them is bye bye. No, no. And if they want to come back, they come back. All right. I think a better way to approach is to move forward and bow out and do the remaining work, which definitely needs to be done and'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Makes no absolutely no sense. It's void of intelligence. So the city long has the capacity to get it done with wood and the city staff can repair it and do it very well. Parenthetically, I think we do a vote of thanks to Councilman O'Donnell for finding that original can for that institutional memory and finding those funds from'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the it went from one fund to another. Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. It comes from my Marine patrol days, many years ago. I know where thank you assembly was made, and I think this needs to be understood. The staff had indicated that the tendency is for larger boats.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not so. Not so. The average. The best. What we are. The target market we should have is those around 34. Once you get beyond 34 feet. You have a problem. You can't take it out as often unless you have a full crew.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's why 90% of these boats just sit there. You need the crew to operate that. So our market is in that 34, up to a 34, maybe a 36. Beyond that, they sit there too long. All right. God the only people to tell you otherwise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Who are the brokers who want to move those things? Period. Additionally, I think that we should understand why that small we need small boats is. We are the only place that has the breakwater we have that gives us, in fact a de facto in the lake where George Joe Sixpack can go out and spend the weekend behind'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the breakwater without going out into the high seas.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I was a little incredulous at the staff's report that there was 10.9 million missing from the Marina Fund, that that we were penalized for going on, what, 18 years now? You know, I don't know how that could have happened.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, to be honest with you, I think we should probably request interest back from the Tidelands funds for our $10.9 million loan amounts are a little incredulous that the work will not be done on the slips and base and two and three except for the electrical work, we hope.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And yet the staff is recommending greater than market increases and slip fees to get us to a market position when in fact that we have substandard slips and we have slips that don't deserve that type of slip feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also notice that we gave tonight the Long Beach Slope Club a break in their permit fees. Well, if we're sending in substandard slips, I think that the basin two and three should also get a permit or get a break in our slip fees for being in substandard facilities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not going to say my fourth point because it's not politically correct, but I will comment on Mr. Good, his comments. As you know, to be honest with you, Mr. Goodhue, unless you're down at the marina, unless you own a boat, you don't know what you're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I'm I'm not a yacht broker, and I do take my boat out. And I love being on the water. And I can tell you, everybody here loves being on the water and lesser slips. So let's finish the marina.'",
