        "'speaker_1': 'I only lived in Southern California for a couple of years and my boyfriend actually sailed over and we landed right in this big racing world. It was the biggest thing I'd ever seen. So Long Beach had been transformed and amidst that excitement, we actually got engaged that weekend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my story of Long Beach is also the story of my family. We have attended the race so many different ways. We've sailed over, we've camped there, we've stayed in hotels. We always stay out three days because we don't want to miss a thing.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'had braved the elements. So I asked that lone race baby this morning why she liked the Grand Prix so much all these years. And she said many things. But the one thing that I had to totally agree with is it's a giant block party by the beach and I couldn't agree more.'",

Most likely, you probably don't think of busses when you think of Grand Prix and a car race. But it is a partnership that we have appreciated over the years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you probably know, Long Beach Transit runs a number of extra busses during the weekend and we have estimated that we provided rides for over 11,000 customers on our bus and aqua bus service during this year's Grand Prix.'",

Co-investment, sure. And we support the Grand Prix by providing ushers for the grandstands that are in race weekend as well as information booths from our own Paddock Club.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But more importantly, what we do is we reach out into the community. We are currently a community service organization and we partake in all the community events. We help with the marathon tree planting speech cleanup and also with the Substance Abuse Foundation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also help with the feeding the homeless on Thanksgiving as well as on Labor Day and partake with all their activities as well. Also, I don't think it's well known, but each year we adopt a charity in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This year it's a Long Beach Police Foundation. We were able to raise over $5,000 to give as a foundation. So even though we are a race committee and we help to raise, we're taking the cue from Grand Prix Association in Long Beach.'",
