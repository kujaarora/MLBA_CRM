        "'speaker_7': 'used to live. He gave a letter that was in the packet that I gave you guys after I was revoked. I had a appeal. So in doing my appeal rights, they told me I could remain open throughout the whole time of the bullying tactics of the neighbors and the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was told by Mr. Mackey. That I appealed my appeal incorrectly and now I have to close. So I told Mr. Mackie, No, you pale George incorrectly. He said No. I appealed to correctly, but he kept telling me I had to close, but he didn't know why.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When it boiled down to it, he finally said, Well, they told me not to appeal my conditional use permit, so I didn't appeal my conditional use permit. Now you have to get out. Now you have to close. But that was bullying by the city that made Mr. Mackey go ahead and not appeal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So he is still able to keep is able to rent out his business without a liquor license. I continue to stay open. I'm actually I'm still open now. Well, not now, but I've been operating without a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The city has been coming in every week and giving Mr. Mackey a citation. Because it's not. My citation is Mr. Mackey's. But I still remain open and I haven't had any problems. But the neighbors are still calling the police.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I notice I was hit last week. Mordaunt came in here and told you they were being interrupted by the police. They didn't want those people coming over. It was actually black people. But Muldoon's and Daleys both both operate without a entertainment permit, and they both have deejays and bands.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I got a ticket and had to go to a criminal court because I operated without a deejay. If I go to a criminal court, I will no longer have my job. If I'm so, I got to take it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'February 22nd, the prosecutor's office sent me a letter, March like March the 17th, telling me I had to go to a criminal court for a crime I committed for having a deejay without a permit. I never got a citation January 7th issue to me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I figured if I did something wrong when they came into the facility based on a side of me, then none of my bartenders got a citation. I didn't get a citation, but I went to court and I pled guilty off a ticket that I thought I had.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's not what I even went to court for. That's another plot by the city. Six other bar owners told me they got the police came and told them they could not have a deejay. All they did was turn the deejay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They just deejay just left. But I get a ticket and I have to go to court to get criminally prosecuted and be on probation for a year, all because of a deejay, but nobody other. Mr. Austin, you don't have no entertainment permits in your area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Neither do you. Mr. Richardson And I don't see any of those people going to criminal court for a deejay, and that's just the most obscene thing I could ever hear of my life. The next we have in the hearings, our main witness says he had to sell his house for 20 to $50000 less because the buyer was'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a nuisance. So he had to hurry up and get out of there like I told him last time I seen him. Nice time you sell your house. Why don't you buy one pass? Because he wasn't even on the property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But you testify under oath that I had to move. I had to move because the boy was. He's quiet and everything. So you get the whole sympathy thing put on. He's crying, telling a lie. The next man next to him says, I could attest to that because I do real estate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And yes, he did lose between 20 to $50000. That's this man right here and that man going in right then. But liars, there's just too much liars. Then when asked by the city attorney, did you know anything about this video?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, we did. We put the video together, in his words. Well, why didn't the other side get it? We wanted to surprise them. Whatever happened to Discovery don't should not be privy of all the information that I'm going to be accused of so I could be able to fight for myself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During this whole process, I have not been able to fight, put myself. Because the bullying city and the bully counsels that don't listen and nobody and you bully and neighbors just want me out of there is worse things happen at other bars then that's going on at my bar.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You mentioned last week Rock Sands is wonderful. They had a shooting at blocks and you mention it when you said how wonderful it was at a shooting at my bar. It was it as noted in the hearing paperwork.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's that I had a murder in my bar. That's incorrect. They're writing things. And those are not the things that matter inside the bar. No. And a suicide attempt. How? How will I know when somebody leave their girlfriend, break up with them, they walk out and commit suicide?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's like you watching TV and you Macca's not not coming on no more because she did. So you just can't kill yourself. That's how I see it. How can I. How can my security if I had security, my security, what?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I knew this man was going to kill herself. As a matter of fact, there was not even a trace of blood in front of my bar or in the back of my bar. So I believe he was at the 710 mark.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The man didn't even speak English. Then another incident. Somebody got stabbed inside the bar. No, they did not get stabbed inside the bar. Somebody got stabbed. A guy got stabbed because he was flirting with a black guy across the street at a laundromat.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The black guy proceeded to chase him. The guy hit him with a hammer. So the black guys, that guy ran in the bar. So because he had one beer in there earlier, that's my.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fault.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That that that can't. All this stuff is has. You have to be actually embarrassed. But put me up by some foolishness like this where we had told us that was Oprah for 50,000 years that had 50 murders in tow bar was outside of tables and around tables.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Tell us, in the service district just last week they had was just a knock out brawl. Police sitting out in the front door watching. I can't even continue on YouTube this year because that north side is something that you have to understand.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm the only black lady bar owner in Long Beach. Yeah, I do cater to black people. Not all, but some. It's a group of black people that need a place to go because they're not going to go to tables and they're not going to go to tailgate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't want to go to rock bands because they don't want us in rock band. They're going to go to dailies because my bartender like getting shot at in front of the window. I told you guys last week, that's where you go because you play pool.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have a poorly that's here. They're not there to represent me. They're not going to give me a trophy this year, but they do represent me. I have a group of older guys that play dominoes. My bar is just not about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've changed my whole structure of the bar, but the council, Mr. Turanga, is so taken this so personal, he doesn't even want to speak to me to see what changes I've done or how I've done things to make things better.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My whole thing is just changed. Then for the man in the paperwork to say None of my witnesses were credible. You got a whole group here. Just why you even have this group, this one lady sitting right there testify that those people those people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What are those people? Those black folks? Literally those black folks. I knew they were from her bar because they were those black folks. So some homeless people that's out there. And she said, the lady defecated in the broad daylight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's two black homeless ladies that's on that street at Young One and an older one. I let some women in the bar sometimes use the bathroom not all the time, because they clean up in the toilet. But it helped the homeless and then we wouldn't really have a problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have homeless people drinking in the back. All of that is not what is cut out to be those days that was on the air. Sure, those things was happening, but it's not happening now. And that's when I first open.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'that there's no music, that that's played loud. We haven't had a DJ. And furthermore, I've had many, many fundraisers there. I've had one for breast cancer, I've had one for the class of 1985, probably. Jack Jackrabbits for our 30 year reunion assisted my.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Friend with her class.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of 86 reunion fundraiser there, and those monies went to notable organizations either within our community or nationwide, i.e. breast cancer. Did we have a bunch of people there? Yes, we did. I'm 50 years, though. We have 5050 year old women that were doing a paint and sip.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not sure how that disrupted the community. I'm pretty sure they were upset about all of our BMW, them Mercedes and Porsches and all the other things that they drive parked in front of their house. And I like this car backfiring.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time next week, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hello. My name is Kelly Melton and I am a patron of Michael's Sports Bar. And I just want to kind of touch up on a couple of things here because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I really.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hate that it's gotten to this point. Back in November of last year at the meeting when this at the council meeting, when this issue first came up, I do remember that there was a takeaway basically from that meeting directly from the mayor asking you, Ranga and Councilman Andrews, to try and work with the community and Deedee to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'try to get a resolution to this issue. So we wouldn't have to get to this point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At that time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A few of us did meet with Didi. We had some meetings on trying to brainstorm on things that we can do. And I myself personally took the challenge to reach out to Councilman Andrews. And you, Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Called both offices.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to no avail, no response from them. So I'm just kind of appalled and and all that. The city's not taking a different stance on this to see what they can do to try and help this business owner, but also help the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I'm not going to deny what happened on that video because it's there. But I'm sure there's more to the video. I don't page I don't patronize the bar that late, so I can't tell you what happens after 10:00.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I know for me, 50 year old woman, professional.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've lived in the big.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Screen knows community. I lived in the Wrigley and in the central area. Things happen everywhere and we can't control the things that happen outside of the bar. I really feel that she can't. I think that she's made a change.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's been a drastic change to the bar, and I think that the community's not willing to open their eyes to see that the changes that she's made and those changes have come basically from her seeing this video and the things that were going on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that all this red tape that the city is putting her through is personally a waste of my tax dollars because we see and hear about the same things that happened in other bars and other communities. And so how I look at it as we have a a bar in place with the African-American bar owner that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we can say 80% of her customers are African-American, yet you all are doing everything you can to shut her down and not try and work with her. So for me, I just have an issue with that. Again, I accept you, Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You take some time and meet with her. If not, have your staff person at least return some phone calls? Because I know I personally reached out to you to try and mitigate this issue based on what the mayor recommended.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I have to say thank you.'",

But the last three years I do it, go to the bar, and sometimes I even ride my bike down there because I'm retired and there's not'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time next week, please. Good evening. I just wanted to say that for me. You start with your name, sir. Can I remain nameless? Is that fine or. I don't think so. My name as a hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to have Joe Taylor. Thank you. And I just want to say that for an average Joe like me, I'm a working man. I work every day. I've made it through all this rough neighborhood. That's all. That neighborhood ain't rough basketball for what they're talking about, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But through all this, I've not heard one time where there has been any arrests made directly because of somebody doing something at the bar, that murder. They want to talk about that stab and all this stuff. We're not directly linked to the bar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in order of fairness, we talk about American dreams here. We are given $80,000 for VIP records, which I'm all with that. But we're taking this lady's livelihood and other people's livelihood. This is a serious situation. And I understand I'm a homeowner also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand that it could be things that could be a nuisance, but I just think that we should be able to come to some kind of medium to where because we're are the police. If if, if, if all this problem is, why haven't there been any arrest in that neighborhood directly connected to Meeko Sports Lounge?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He has a video where we have who knows what, how he got it or how he doctored that up. But why haven't the police arrested whoever he was yelling at, whoever if that guy was committing the crime? But last time I heard yelling, it's really not a crime.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm just here, like I say, rather than Average Joe as a safe place for me to go and to have a cocktail after drink and on the weekends, whatever, catch my own or whatever, I feel safe there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm pretty sure the people that go there feel safe there. And I've heard about no property damage. I mean, they have a couple of cops don't punish everybody for a few people's bad actions after a few bad experiences.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The shooting two years ago was I have to do it now. Once they all say rectify the situation, we're not hearing about anything that was current. I haven't heard about anything. A 2017 The last thing I think they said on a record with something like April or some 2016, that's still over a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm just saying try to if you think about it, try to give her at least. A way to rectify the situation. And I know council, you guys have all kind of other stuff on your agenda. It might not be important to you, but for an average Joe, that's important to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just like where these people are, if they are guilty for that. Just like for those people, then to prove it. That's not prove, though. Just some video, some guy made up. And then they didn't even give her a chance to defend herself against that video.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if we Americans let's be fair, let's give her at least the opportunity to defend herself and have all the evidence that's being brought against her in her bar so she can take it to her counsel. And because that video come on, look, that that that was kind of doctored up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, anybody can tell that, but I don't know how it works. But I'm just saying, like I said, I'm representing Average Joe. My time has come in and I just think that you should give her a fair chance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are Americans. Let's be American. Get ready for a fair chance. Thank you. Thank you. Next big, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hello. My name is Monisha Israel and I am a bartender at Mika's Sports Lounge. First of all. I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm so. This means a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, I mean, this is my only job. I have been there. On May 7th, seventh, I celebrate my three year anniversary. And because I was there during the debate, the initial beginning. And from then to now is a completely different place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that you should go by what it is now, not what happened two and a half years ago, because it's not like that anymore. All of that you saw on the tape, it's not like that. We don't have the time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're closing early. I mean, I work there and it's not people it's not a lot of people that go there. We have our regular people that come and they've been coming and they want to continue to come and I want to continue to work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So with that being said, please vote for us to give Jessie her license. Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Race. Esther is president.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of the National Association for Equal Justice America, a national civil rights organization. We're very concerned about the allegations by Michael's sports analogies. One of the things that we're very concerned about is a defamation of her character under the 14th Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She did not get due process or equal protection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the law like most businesses do. Number four, she did not get probation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In order to correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The problems. Five Ms.. Fiancee's witnesses was not credible, but witnesses that the city used was all credible. Credible. That doesn't sound.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right to me as a national civil rights president.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ABC came by 16 times and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Found nothing wrong. Results of this The city took her business license. She has a right to make a living. It's not a privilege. In America, we feel that it's a human rights violation as a civil rights group and a lot of people know me as a national authorized president, we wouldn't be here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She's a member of organization, and we wouldn't be here if she didn't get due process protection of the law. One of the things that that we were concerned about is, is. We should all try to get along this lady.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's money in her business. And she has a right to make a living, have a right to have shelter. And it's not a privilege. Is it national civil rights? The defamation of a character is something that we look at, a civil rights group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the things that we did in Culver City, we had a big problem with the police department and we brought. People down there, too. But there are hiring practices where I think what we're doing, we're trying her on her priors and not what's happening currently and the person that no laws.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're very concerned about that. She has a right to own a business in America. I'm not saying it's racism, but I'm saying that it's something that we need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To look at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And everyone deserves due process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Equal protection of the law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a national civil rights group. I don't care what color you are. We have a moral nature. If you miss that, our members will come after you. Thanks a lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time. Next week, a police. Excuse me. Good afternoon, counsel. My name is Jonathan Taylor. I'm a justice advocate with the National Association for Equal Justice of America, along with Mr. Esters, who is the president of the organization.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am as he is, we're new to this issue with Ms.. Yancey Bar and all that were due to this particular incident. We're not new to issues of unfairness, of an injustice, I would say, to the fine neighbors that surround that bar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's unfortunate that the disagreement seems to have become so personal against Ms.. Yancey I would say this when I was able to visit the location of that bar last week, what stuck out in my mind is that 500 feet south of Mrs. Yancey, there's a building there that has a large sign open all over it, saying they're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'getting ready to open a bar called a parlor or lap. 500 feet west of here, there's a liquor store that stays open, 24 hour closes at 2:00. It just seems to me it just seems to me that and from what I've heard here today, that there's been a bar, that location for the last 30 years, it seems'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to me that the city believes that that location is an appropriate place for a bar. That street is terribly, terribly busy. And if indeed that street and that location is not suitable for a bar, then maybe the city may need to consider rezoning that portion of that street so no one can open a bar there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not necessarily just Ms.. Yancey, it just has with those things that just has the appearance of unfairness. This this city has a rich history. It markets itself as an international city. And when you're an international city, you've been very important to the development of the American society.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Navy was based here during World War Two, and our country took on the shape of being the power that it is from World War Two. You have a woman, a black woman, the only woman in this city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She's fortunate enough to own a bar. I'm not going to call these fine neighbors races at all. I'm not going to call you racist at all. But it is a fact of life that in our society, certain people aren't welcome, certain places.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's just a fact of life. But I would also say to the neighbors, I myself am used to living in places that aren't tenable. I would simply suggest to you in the matter of Ms.. Yancey, try something different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Postpone the revocation of her license for 90 days. Allow her to form a a sit down relationship with some members of the police department, some members of this neighborhood council, and certainly under the guidance of the police department and with considering the question of the neighbors, certainly some kind of and minimal operating formula can be considered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would suggest that there's always the opportunity to closer, but at least provide 90 more days and allow that kind of coalition to take place. Thank you for your time. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name is Bobby Richardson, Jr. I want to start off by saying I love you, Dee Dee. We're here because I want to believe it's a misunderstanding, because the people who are talking bad about Deedee and saying all these things that she's not owning up to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Kind of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we continue, sir.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She just do me. I it. I just think that they. They, like I said before when I was here, that if everybody gets a chance to sit down and understand one another instead of passing judgment because of someone else's ignorance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any bar that you go to in that area or any area you go to, whether it's Orange County or Long Beach, you're going to have some ignorant people while they're drinking that don't necessarily mean it's her fault. And when these people are talking about her, they're they're speaking so personal about her as if they know her.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And she's completely the opposite person. Just like Bill got up here and said he feels uncomfortable. He's he's a gay man. He feels uncomfortable the way that the neighbors are treating him when he comes to our bar. And I live in Paris, California.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm a longshoreman. I've been on her 20 years. When I get off work. I like to go there, too. That 91 traffic died down. And then I get on the freeway and go home and then door going out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That time is when I built the relationship with Didi and it's crazy because my dad worked for Boeing and he used to go buy tables. That was his spot to sit at to go let the traffic die down.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So he asked me one day, where you go? I said, I go buy me goes. He said, lets me go. I said, Did he ever see all that? And he got scratching his head. He said, yes. He said, I know our dad.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So remember Didi when I came in, actually. That to me was like, okay, damn, I'm. I'm sorry. Walking in my pop's footsteps were like, he retired from from bowling, which is Donald Douglas. And I'm gonna retire from the longshoreman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we doing the same things, and I'll never even know it. But he chose that bar, and I'm choosing her bar. And like I told you guys before, if you all took the time to come in there and get to know the people that's in there, not the people, that's the ignorant people that's outside the bar.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When it's almost 2:00 in, the bar is closing and everybody's drunk. Those are the people that are singing and those are not the people that's in there every day. We know each other on a first name basis, first name, but it's like, cheers, a TV show.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sure all y'all on and watched. All y'all don't watch. That's how we are, amigos. Don't judge us like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, sir. I give a few more minutes because you got interrupted. But thank you for your time. I'm good. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, counsel. My name is Jermaine. I was born and raised here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm a photojournalist for a Long Beach Times newspaper and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also a Freemason. It's just strange to me how when a person owns a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Business, how they could be blamed for something that's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That happens outside of their business. And they they put the blame on her. When you have mass shootings at schools, are the schools responsible for the shootings that happened there or the mass shootings that happen at the post office?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was the post office responsible for that shooting? Should they be accountable? I think not. The problem here, your own counsel, is the problem of a person trying to own a business or trying to have a livelihood. When I was young businesses, black businesses were all throughout Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the questions used to be asked to me, What do you want to be when you grow up? I used to say a fireman, police officer or a business owner. The question never came to me a president because I never seen a president.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, 2017, the questions asked to children. What do you want to be when you grow up? They say a policeman, fireman or a president, not a business owner. So something right there is wrong to me. Here in Long Beach, I'm a business owner, but I had to move my business outside of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just have a successful business. I'm born. Raised here in Long Beach. Ex-gang member, ex-drug dealer, ex-convict. But I chose to choose life up to better myself, making sports bars a place where we can all go and enjoy ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of ex-gang members do go here. A lot of ex-drug dealers do go there. But one thing that we do have is family, a community, a family that we used to have here in Long Beach. We have a lot of places we can go to the Hutch Grant or grant, a Grand Central Station.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had Lucy's go to Saint Lucy's on the West Side. We even had Melody's dance hall in Pacific. But we have nothing to go to nowadays. Absolutely nothing. So what is a community to do when they have nothing to do?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They turn to violence, drug sales or anything like that. It's a pattern. It's a fact. It's not something that somebody made up in a storybook or nothing like that. All you have to do is look at the numbers and facts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much for your time. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. My name is Susan Redfield and I live with my husband in the 2500 block of Main Avenue down the block from the bar. I'm representing my husband who is handicapped and bedridden. I am in favor of keeping the license from the bar owner.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do not take this revocation request lightly, but my life and the others in my neighborhood have been in turmoil on too many occasions. And after three years of following the rules, this is the last resort from when Mika's first opened.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There were problems on the weekends when we were awakened regularly by loud screaming. After midnight, cars raced down the block with music blaring and other unfriendly and frightening elements of disregard to this quiet family neighborhood. So in 2015, I began noting the dates when I was awakened.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I kept a little log in the drawer next to my bed. I have a list of the dates. There are 23 of them between February and November. Then there was the Christmas shooting, of which you've heard too much.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I won't go into that. What you didn't see in the video that was shown was the vomiting in our bushes, the urinating and defecating on our lawns, drunk people falling down in the middle of the street and having to be carried away.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then there was the stabbing. I am now often faced. At night in my own home, I've been participating with the neighbors in a attempt to improve this situation. We've met with city leaders, the police at various homes, including my own.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've met at the police station. We've followed all the rules and regulations required in order to make our complaints known to the bar owner. To give her proper notice. To give notice to the bar. The building owner. Sorry, I'm a little nervous due to the building owner and notice to the police in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's been three years. It's come to this point not in a whimsy, but after nearly three years of requesting, begging, pleading that the noise, the violence, the other illegal activities and outlandish behaviors stop. They violate the CFP and they violate my peaceful life.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I should mention that that Councilman Wrangham and many neighbors met after the 2015 incident, and there was significant discussion about the financial cost to the city of Long Beach that this bar and its problems have caused. The number of police that have been times the police have been called had to come and check out the situation, meet'",
        "'speaker_7': 'with neighbors, attend hearings. The Planning Commission hearing was 10 hours long. The eviction hearing had a 17 page report. This is not how a should a city should have to manage its business affairs. I want to close by saying that this neighborhood, my neighborhood is relatively reflective of all that makes Long Beach great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a mix of young and old families and singles, diverse in all ways. That's what I love about it. My issue is with makos and it's total disregard for our well-being, and it's unreasonable interference with my family's peace and safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Susan. Next, Peter, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello again. I'm Dana Dedmon. I live across the street from Michael's. This is the sixth time I've either spoken publicly or testified on this matter. And my third time in front of you, the first time I was at this podium was on March 17th, 2015.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I urge you to deny me IQOS a permanent entertainment permit because the window rattling music from the bar was keeping me awake at night because of overwhelmingly negative comments by me and others. You voted to deny the permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second time I spoke to you was on August 9th, 2016. I asked that you approve the Long Beach Police Department's recommendation to revoke the bar's business license. You voted to send the matter to the Planning Commission. Next, I spoke at the nine hour City Planning Commission hearing on November 3rd and fourth, 2016.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I testified about the bar's negative impact on neighboring property values. This was evidenced by the under market value sale price of the house directly behind the bar. Your planning commission found the bar to be a nuisance and voted to revoke the business license and conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On March 15th, 2017. I testified before the special hearing officer who was appointed to hear the bar's bar owners appeal. During that hearing, I was cross-examined by lawyers for the bar owner and the building owner. The hearing officer found the evidence credible and upheld the revocation of the licenses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My latest testimony was April 5th, 2017, at the Superior Court regarding an unlawful detainer action against Migos. The court found that, quote, Nichols has been operated in a manner that makes it a public nuisance, unquote. The building owner was awarded his property back to summarize.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You voted to deny the bar a permanent entertainment license. You voted to let the Planning Commission decide if the business license should be revoked. The Planning Commission determined the bar was a nuisance and revoked its business license and conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The hearing officer ruled, quote, The operation of Michael's at the property is a public nuisance within the meaning of the Long Beach municipal code, unquote. He upheld the decision to revoke Michael's licenses. And finally, Judge Douglas Stern of the Superior Court evicted me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cos now I stand before you. Two years and two months later, to remind you that my neighbors and I and many city departments have devoted thousands of hours to this effort. We want assurance of peaceful enjoyment of our homes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do not want to go through this again. Michael's can no longer occupy 710 West Willow, but your constituents in other parts of the city should not have to go through what we have gone through. Do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Deny this appeal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I see Larry is there. If there are any other speakers, please line up. But gentlemen, the blue jacket is the final speaker. Thank you. Proceed. Okay. My name is Michael Anthony Harp. I am a resident of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First of all, I'm really upset and appalled by number one. Susan is right next door to me. She is my neighbor. We still speak on a daily basis. To one another. Even though she sees different from what I see.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'You're not picking on them. Whoever is doing the picking, you're not picking on them. I don't see what the problem is. And for these people to have all these. Outrageous. Criticisms about Michael's. I don't see it. I don't get it.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Nobody is talking. They've got. They've given up. It's what it looks like. The residents and the the bar owner there, everybody's talking on different levels. And I know that from my talks with Elizabeth Griffin, who's the most for the police, that the city is short staffed, a lot of police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I noticed that there's also we're having meetings regarding density that's taking place. And it just appears that when you have housing right on top of a bar, that really is going to create problems. I mean, just generically and I know you've had a property bar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There for 30 years prior is what it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seems like. But in this occasion it appears that they are the bar owner has got a lot of a lot more people that are coming in to her bar. And so, I mean, I realize that there's also been some violations of what appears entertainment stuff.'",

And I can completely understand that if you have that much noise, you're just trying to sleep or relax or do something with your kids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's insane. But at the same time, I think there's some kind of a lesson that can be learned long term from the city, by the way, that it's planning and what it's doing. We have a lot of density, a lot of parking issues, a lot of problems there that maybe could have been solved had we planned the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'area better. And that's all I'm saying. As far as the permitting goes, I would like to see it a due process for everyone. And I don't mean this just for because someone is of the certain race, but I think everybody should be presented a all the information that's against them and they should be able to to address'",
        "'speaker_2': 'each and every one. And and although I know that the residents don't want to have an appeal, I do think that there is some kind of an appeal that should be done just so they can address some of those issues in a formal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Way, each.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One, one by one. Because I understand things like there was a shooting, but it wasn't at the bar, was across the street. That's where it was generated. I mean, little things like that, little nuances may need to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I'm just putting that out there. That's what I'm thinking and that's where I'm going to stay. Thank you. So that concludes public comment. We are going to close the hearing and move it the discussion back behind the rail.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I stopped the video because the language that was in the video, I thought, you know, we got the message and it was a bit inappropriate. And for the viewers to hear some of that language and I do understand and sensitive to the residents may have dealt with that themselves, but it was my prerogative, the chair, to say'",
        "'speaker_2': ', I think we've heard enough when we heard certain language being used, language that I don't allow in my home. So so that's why I stopped that. And one question for staff before I go to Councilmember Urunga, did we follow all appropriate noticing thresholds and requirements before arriving to today?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Okay. Councilmember Durango. Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson, this hearing is part of a lengthy process. It wasn't easy, and it's one of the most difficult decisions that city council has to address are issues like this. It's never easy to hear testimony on both sides regarding the validity or not of a proprietor running a business and how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they run that business. The process was complaints filed, sent to the nuisance abatement people. Our department monitored noise, police department involvement, police calls, visits by vice, visits by poor planning department. And then it goes to the planning. It goes to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We refer it to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission heard all the testimony of everybody on both sides. It made its recommendation. There is appeal. It is sent to a ALJ, which is a reminder of the Chief Administrative Law Judge Legal and administrative law judge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Administrative Law Judge hears again what the Commission heard, reviews all the material, receives all the testimony the same that that the Planning Commission made. And it's an independent ALJ like a judge. He makes his recommendation, and now we're here through the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So having said all that, I just want to ask the city attorney and and Vice Mayor Richardson alluded to it. Has due process been followed? Have we done everything we possibly can up to this point to where we are now with this hearing?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilman Urunga, I would in my estimation, I would say definitely yes. Not only was the process followed that you just described, but prior to that process, there was much interaction by various city departments in attempt to resolve the situation short of a revocation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As you know, and as you mentioned, a revocation is a fairly drastic measure that the city does not like to engage in. They like to short stop it by trying to get things to work out regardless of what the type of businesses that may be causing a nuisance in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There was outreach not only by the city prosecutor's office, the city attorney's office, the health department, the building department, the planning, the building and planning department, most certainly the police department, health department, all in an effort to get this into compliance so that they there would not be a necessity to take the next step, which was the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'revocation and many meetings, not only with the neighbors, but certainly with the property owner. The property owner, his wife attempts to meet with Mrs. Yancey. Ms.. Miss Yancey, numerous correspondences written to Ms.. Yancey, notifying her of the situation that it was existing out at the bar.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I don't remember if it was eight, nine or ten, our planning commission hearing a six hour hearing in front of the hearing officer and then tonight. So yes, due process was followed. Our process was followed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are we talking about this situation here? But were there other legal issues concerning this location as well, that there was a case that went to a superior court? I think it was, or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that that item is not technically part of tonight. But one of the speakers alluded to it because he testified apparently as a witness in that case. What he was referring to is that the property owner, Mr. Mackey, filed an unlawful detainer action in the Superior Court to have Mrs. Yancey removed from the premises.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the judge, who's a Superior Court judge at the courthouse next door, issued a lengthy opinion, which we've read and reviewed and did make a finding that a nuisance activity for chronic nuisance activity existed at that location to the extent that Mr. Mackey had the right to evict Ms..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yancey from the premises, and the judge did order that. As far as I know, she's still there. There's another process that would be followed before she was locked out, so to speak. But there was a judgment entered against Ms..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yancey for eviction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now that we're talking about that. Can you clarify what the meaning is when you have a cup revocation? What's what's the consequences of a cup revocation? And what is a c, u p?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So a copy is a conditional use permit and the city routinely requires a cup for those types of uses in the city that are more intensive type uses, the type that need a little bit more regulation. We have coupes with bars, bars and restaurants that have alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other facilities that serve alcohol are the ones that come before you more most often with the ups. We have check cashing that has sirups and other uses type that such as that type those types. So that's what a copy is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In this particular case, there was a copy that was issued to the property owner way back when, which allowed him to operate a bar at that location. The the the hearing before the Planning Commission involved both the revocation of the business license and the C up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have no idea what the motivation was, but neither. Of the two parties, Miss Yancey, or the business owner chose to, or the property owner chose to appeal. The revocation of the CPD only appealed the revocation of the business license.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So legally now no bar can be operated at that location. And I believe one of the witnesses testified, or maybe even since he testified, that the property owner is currently receiving citations from the city or has in the recent past received citations regarding operation without a copy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Maybe there is a strategic reason why the property owner chose not to appeal the CPA. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So Mr. Yancey made an application that she is still open. So is there a date certain when this up takes effect? Is it in effect now? She she claimed that she was allowed to continue to operate the business during this whole process, that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We didn't go to court to shut her down. But technically, the minute that the appeal period lapsed after the CFP was revoked, anybody that operated a bar out there was doing so illegally. And that continues through today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you. Well, we are here tonight tasked with whether to revoke the business license for the establishment due to numerous violations, including police calls for service noise violations, health department violations, illegal construction opening without a business license and hosting special events without an occasional event permit, among other allegations, including inadequate security and parking as required'",
        "'speaker_2': 'by the CFP. When Ms. Yancy applied for an entertainment permit from the City Council. At that hearing, I advised her to sit down with the neighbors and establish a working relationship and then come back and apply for another entertainment permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To this day, after two years, Ms.. Yancy still refuses to meet with the neighbors under oath at the revocation hearing. Ms.. Yancy described the need to meet with neighbors as outside of her responsibility as a business owner. I met with Ms..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yancy. Yes, I did. We met in my office with planning people, with the police department. And we talked about the need for her to reach out into the community, into her neighbors, to try to mitigate some of the issues that they were having and some of the disagreements, obviously, that they were having.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She also communicated with my staff, which she indicates she did not. My staff is not my my check girl. Whatever. She she's my chief of staff. My staff reiterated the same suggestions that were brought up to her at our original meeting, which were to work on mitigating the concerns raised by the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this included some basic suggestions, including keeping the back door closed, lower the volume of the music, and connect her video camera with the lounge police department to establish a line of communication with the neighbors and to establish a line of communication with the neighbors to this date.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'None of those suggestions were implemented. I want to touch on the video as well. I saw this video for the first time today as well. I hadn't seen it prior to today. I was amazed that that. Situation to agitate police and that these neighbors had to tolerate everything that was taking place there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had the same emotion as Vice Mayor Richardson. However, it's fact and it's what you saw is what happened. The video was but a brief snapshot. Into what it was like for the neighbors on Maine Avenue and in the surrounding area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sadly, this is what was occurring at the bar, and yet the business owner refused to meet with the neighbors to try to mitigate these conditions. I firmly believe that if we had reached a point of mitigation, we wouldn't be here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if the proprietor was willing to work with the city and the neighbors to find solutions on the ongoing issues, we wouldn't be here. This, in addition to this and finally this establish establishment is incompatible with the neighborhood, given its numerous calls for service and other violations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I asked my colleagues to please support the motion on the floor. Thank you. And it's seconded by Councilwoman Gonzalez. Would you like to speak to your motion, your second? No. Okay. Thank you. Seeing no further council comment and we've already had a public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will go ahead and cast our vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So now we have time for our public comment. I'm sorry. Go for it. I just like to say that the staff has some suggestions for Miss Yancey. It's not the end of the world in terms of getting a business license.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can apply for a new license after a year. If I'm not mistaken, can staff provide some additional recommendations as to what can happen from here on out? Yes. Thank you, Councilmember. And we would like to offer that, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yancey, have the availability to sit down with our economic and property development department to see if there is assistance and have been through our business outreach efforts that we can provide. And we would be happy to make that connection and sit down and talk about what the city can do to help her with future small business endeavors'",

    "Loan Approval and Agreement Amendment for the Aquarium of the Pacific Corporation.": [

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I want to thank staff for working hard on this. I also want to thank the aquarium for their vision and commitment to expand and make sure that we have a world class facility here in the second district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I wanted to just ask a couple of questions, actually. Could we go to a staff report?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can we just check and make sure we got quorum? We do. No one else can leave. Okay. So let's have a staff report. Certainly. We've been working on this with the aquarium for some time for their $53 million addition for Pacific Visions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm interested in this over to assistant city manager Tom Modica.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He's been working closely with the aquarium. And also we have our finance director, John GROSS, has been intimately involved in these details. So, Tom, the image manager, vice mayor and members of the council and Councilmember Pearce. Yes. As the manager mentioned, this Pacific Visions is a $53 million educational exhibit that is going to include an immersive theater'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and a changing exhibit gallery. The council considered and approved a $15 million challenge grant. We are the lead donor for this $53 million project, which the city is going to invest about $15 million over the next several years into this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The rest of the project is privately fundraised. So essentially the city will be getting a $53 million city owned facility for $15 million of city investment and allow a wonderful educational institution, the Aquarium of the Pacific, to continue to grow and thrive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This has been their best year yet and revenues are doing very well. But they are looking to the future about how to grow this facility and continue to bring in the roughly 1.8 million visitors, I believe 1.5, 1.8 million visitors a year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what you're seeing tonight is since the challenge, Grant, the aquarium is in need of a bridge loan. They have a number of contract contributions that are coming in over the next several years that are contributed by donors, including the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in order to start with the construction, they need a loan. They've been out to the market to look for a loan. But because of the way that the city's bond indentures are structured, that has proven to be a little more difficult than expected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What this recommendation is, is for the city to be basically the bank for this project and to loan out the money to be repaid and completely by the Aquarium of the Pacific. And so it allows for that bridge loan to proceed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Currently, we're not we are not expecting the loan to provide any impacts or to have any impacts on projects or had those types of adverse impacts. And I would like, in addition to the items that are listed in the staff report, for all the different terms that we would be entering into.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do want to read one additional term that we've agreed on in discussions with the aquarium that provides further protection to the city. Essentially, we would like to add that, quote, The cash from the loan must now be must be from new bond proceeds or the Tidelands operating reserve and any other cash source needs to be approved'",
        "'speaker_2': 'by the city council. So essentially this changes so that we would go for bond issuance and drop from operating reserve, but we would not be temporarily borrowing any project cash, which was seen as a as a minor eventuality in your staff report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we are comfortable only restricting to those two and we would come back to council if that very slim possibility ever occurred and have that discussion with council. And with that, we're available for questions. Thank you. We'll go back to Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you for that addition to the report. I wanted to just ask, can you go over a little bit some of that oversight and explain to us, say they're late on a payment, what's that situation like?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And also explain to us a little bit of the oversight with fundraising and how how are we making sure that we're on track for the goals that we have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So as noted in the staff report, the aquarium continues to fundraise. Right now they have about a $10 million goal. The aquarium has let us know that they believe that they will have that in hand or pledged by the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So $43 million would be raised to date and that would be the final $10 million that would be raised. The city does sit on the aquarium board. We have an ex-officio member who is there and is able to participate in the discussion and make sure that we're getting updates as part of the terms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They will be giving progress reports every six months on where they are. They are also providing sources and uses and a variety of information about where the money would be coming from and how those funds would be expended.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is also a very complicated document called our implementation agreement. That is from the last time that we did a debt issuance for the aquarium. And it continues to guide the way that we interact with the aquarium legally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that has a number of protections and safeguards that the aquarium is to be reporting out to the city. And we get those reports regularly and we expect more reports in the future, specifically on this on this project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Thank you. And then I just wanted to remind everybody that, you know, this is something that was early whenever I came on the council and said how much I wanted to support the aquarium, the fact that it's an educational center, the fact that doing a development like this in our community also creates jobs and opportunities for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'those live locally. And when I think staff are working on community benefits list with everybody and look forward to kind of teasing that out a little bit more and working with the aquarium to make sure that we can continue to provide those good jobs.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And we too are hopeful that that won't be necessary or essential as we move forward. I do think that, as the staff report indicates, there is a notable amount of risk associated with this particular item.

        "'speaker_3': 'we are extending through the terms of this particular agreement, in my opinion, necessitate better communication between the parties that there has been a changed circumstance, and I believe that's understanding of city staff as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Certainly that is actually in in the proposal from the aquarium that that level of reporting be in there and that level of of responsibility be in there. And we will certainly be keeping the council informed if there's any material change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's something we've agreed to with the aquarium. And the city does have, under the implementation agreement, some steps that it can take if, if and when we reached that point, which we don't believe we will. But if it ever reaches that point, then there are some steps that we would be able to take working with the aquarium'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So yes, we make that commitment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's great, and I don't believe that that will be necessary either. I think the the future for the aquarium is very bright. This expansion is very positive for the area, for this city asset. And I you know, I don't believe those those concerns are warranted at this juncture.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there are definitely something that need to be stated in writing and verbally, in my opinion. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'll just add my comments here that I want to thank both council members and city staff for highlighting the risk associated with this and allowing us to go in eyes open. I personally believe that the you know, the aquarium, the Pacific, one of the best investments we can make of Titans funds is into making sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we continue to have a world class aquarium and that is an educational institution and continue to be referenced as as such, because it brings such benefit and value to the entire city and to the entire region. So I am going to vote in support of this next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And it has been a long night. And so forgive me for failing and my question has already been answered. Please forgive me. But I was reading a staff report. I just want to get some clarification for my benefit and anybody watching at home, what are the actual terms of repayment of this loan since we are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a bank in this matter?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I didn't turn to Jon to add any detail. Essentially, it's a $10 million or a net $10 million loan up to a ten year term. Essentially, they would pay the the actual cost of issuance and and and loan the opportunity cost of what the city would have if it were using its cash to invest plus point'",
        "'speaker_2': '5%. So this is fully repaid by the aquarium and with no impact to city projects and they would cover all the cost. John, if you have anything to add, I think you did a great job. I think the key thing to maybe add is that we have some negotiation to do with regard to the loan, but the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'key aspects of the loan will be that the payments from the aquarium will exactly match our disbursement for the bond issue cost so that there will be no net impact on the Tidelands Fund. Plus, we will get a little extra for our trouble.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it will actually benefit the Titans fund. So the aquarium will repay the loan and then we will turn around and use probably 98% of that money or 99% of that money to pay debt service with no impact on the Tidelands Fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I maybe this is a bigger question, but can we bond on the debt we were owed?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, we cannot. It's a very good question. We are actually going to issue bonds using the overall revenues of the Tidelands Fund, not just the aquarium repayment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in terms of oversight, what type of oversight do we have in terms of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Knowing that we're going to be repaid, that over the 15 years?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think Assistant City Manager Tom Modica described it pretty well. We added have added additional reporting requirements, we have added additional requirements in the budget preparation and we have also added requirements that if there is any issue that comes to the attention of the board that could impact things, they are required to notify us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then my last question, because these are, I guess, now public funds going into a quayside public, private situation. Are these are there books or are these funds subject to audit?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, the the aquarium books are subject to audit. The auditor, the aquarium and the city auditor have worked together to define the terms of who is allowed to audit. And we receive the audited records ourselves and we have added additional authority over the format of that audit report, although we like the way the report is provided now'",
        "'speaker_5': '. All right. Thank you very much.'",
