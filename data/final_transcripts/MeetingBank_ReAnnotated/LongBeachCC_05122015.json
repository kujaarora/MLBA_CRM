And I appreciate the opportunity to just share with you briefly. Since opening in December of 2011, Long Beach Yellow Cab has been a tremendous supporter for our families.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can tell you that just last year we served approximately 700 families, which equates to about 3000 people. Many of those don't come to our Long Beach Ronald McDonald House with transportation.

        "'speaker_6': 'So I want to thank them for that. The industry is absolutely changing and there's no question about it. I want to give this particular business an acknowledgment for understanding what it means to stay current and make some significant changes to your operations and your business model in light of the changing industry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the things that I've found when we talk with a lot of our businesses in the community, mostly smaller businesses, but the changes are happening around them and they're reacting to them and sometimes they're responding too late and they're not understanding what happened.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the truth is that their business model did not change in light of the surrounding environment around them. And so the fact that you are rebranding yourselves, I think is huge. There's all sorts of data and research out there that talks about how a brand impacts a company's success.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that's huge. And changing basically your service model. The fact that we are one of the first cities to kind of embark upon this process of relaxing some of the requirements or thinking outside the box in terms of what we can do to help a business is something that I'm happy to be doing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's it remains to be seen in terms of what other cities do and where we go with this debate in the in the nation as a whole. But given the fact that we have a long partnership with with this particular business, I think that it's a it's definitely a venture worth taking and pursuing and doing'",

So I hope that my colleagues join us and moving forward, I want to thank staff for coming to us with these recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know they've worked really hard and our team has really educated those of us who are on the Economic Development Finance Committee, really about the industry and the changes in the industry and the real necessity for us to try to do something to solidify the partnership and really to support the partnership.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. I, too, would like to echo and what I to council members are speaking about the yellow card. You know, I am in fully support of the yellow cab, you know, request to authorize additional cabs as well as offering competitive prices to our constituents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have been a very reliable company in our city and has been a strong reputation of constantly giving back to our community and providing a level of outstanding services now to pay. They've known to pay their fees, often discounted towards our seniors and disability and the 50 square miles of guaranteed coverage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can go on and on about the bill, the benefits of having them in, not only in my community but throughout the entire city of Long Beach. It is truly a privilege to work with the company who has been in business for so many years and is known to know for their standards and have never, ever wavered'",

It's been there for all of the big events. And so if you have any pedicabs, I invite you to beat Streets on June six.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Before we go to a vote, I'm going to make a couple quick comments. Let me just first, obviously echo what the council said, but I want to make sure that we're very clear what the council's doing tonight actually is the first of its kind across the country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This has not happened anywhere else where a city is actually deregulating a taxi company to allow it to be more competitive in the current market marketplace. Right now, I think it's there's a nationwide conversation happening about the sharing economy and what that means to industry, and particularly industry that has for a long time provided good jobs for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the people with a steady paycheck, provided good service. And so what Yellow Cab is doing by by moving to this new model and by the city supporting it, is allowing this company to innovate, to deregulate, and to be able to be competitive with the other models that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In addition to that, I think the rebrand is really incredibly thoughtful. I think that it's going to be exciting to see a new app as well as a new brand that will be competitive. All the other products that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is not about not supporting what is happening in the sharing economy. This is about supporting a community partner that has been with us for a long time and ensuring that those services that are only provided by taxi companies, the services to the disabled, the services on Election Day, the services for seniors, the easy access to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for tourists who are dependent on seeing a cab when they arrive at the airport, remain in the city, and to ensure that we stay competitive across the country. So this is actually a very important and significant moment, I think, and I'm really proud of Long Beach for taking the lead on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This issue, any time it's come before a city. At any city has been, quite frankly, a total disaster. And I think you've seen a breakdown of people working together. And I think this has been something that I'm really, really proud of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank Yellow Cab. I want to thank city staff. And I want to thank the council for for being so thoughtful here. And with that, we'll call the vote.'",

Also, the cost of the contract is estimated to be $101,161 per year and would be funded from the appropriation that is currently budgeted for the in-house ERP program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'After the program is fully implemented in FY16, the insurance fund would realize some savings and there would be some offset and there would be some reallocation to other funds that you would see as part of the budget process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's anticipated an ongoing citywide savings of about $136,000 would be part of the FY16 budget. It's important to note that no city employees will be displaced of the two employees that were formerly providing in-house services. One employee has transferred to another position in the city and the other employee has retired.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lastly, I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce Michelle Hamilton. She's new to human resources and is going to be in charge or is in charge of our employee benefits division. So you'll see her face. She came to us from the chancellor's office with a wealth of knowledge and employee benefits.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. I want to think the H.R. department, IAP programs are crucial to the health and vitality of a workforce. And I think that those of us who sit on it enough and do some of the settlements know that the EAP programs can really be a mitigating factor in getting us through some of these.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I really appreciate your work on this and I'm excited that we're moving in this direction. I know that our internal staff are always capable. There's always just that perception from city staffers that if an outside organization is handling it, that it's it's a little bit different for them, their own H.R..'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Thank you. And as somebody who works in the labor relations field, I can tell you that EPA is is is a valuable tool for. For our city employees to utilize when in need. I did have a couple of questions regarding the the 2.5 FTC.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What are what's happening with the city employees who were involved in that program?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. One employee has taken transferred to a job at the Health Department and the other employee has retired. The the half time was a part time clerical person that hadn't been used recently.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can't thank you enough. I just also like to just comment that this will save us and your savings of $136,000. And it's great to see that our man management partners have actually saved us some money finally.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Council member Urunga.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Catch your sarcasm there. Councilmember Alston Having been involved with the AP to a certain extent, when I was at the Health Department, I was aware of those employees that were working there in that capacity at that time, also had other affiliated responsibilities with our police and fire departments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in terms of being members of the Met team, I think it was the mental evaluation team. I'm not sure if that's the correct acronym for that. But when there was a situation in the community or or a response necessary, that would require a team of professionals to evaluate a resident or a citizen in in distress or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some kind of emotional disorientation that this team would go out there, make the evaluation to ensure that the that the situation was either one that was controlled. Bottom line, is this contract going to be able to address those issues?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there another alternative method that the police and fire departments will be able to use to address such situations when there is a resident or citizen in distress on the community, whether it's a fire issue or a police issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Councilmember, I did. I believe that most recently. The police met team is operating a little bit differently that maybe it was in the past and they are not requiring any assistance from the city EAP program, although you know, of course we know that they're there, that they're a resource that we could use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if if the city needed them or they needed us, we would certainly. Make sure that our ERP provider would be aware of any, if any assistance was needed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which raises the question, turning to our the employees who used to who did provide the service, they were required to maintain their licenses and their status as bona fide counselors. Is there a method for us to ensure that these consultants are going to be duly licensed and capable of doing these jobs?'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Clients such as the city of Long Beach. So that is a requirement and that would also be part of the contract as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thought I had some thoughts, but I'll let it go. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm also glad to see that we're we're relooking at this, reviewing it and seeing what else we can do. What type of outreach right now is being done for to let employees know that this program even exists?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll take a try at that one until the council approves this. We have not done any outreach. However, that would be something that Michel would handle. There would be a timeline, an implementation timeline. And, you know, our goal would be to get it implemented as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. I would love to see more. I know when we hopefully pass this. I'd love to see this pass that we do have more outreach for our employees to know what specific resources are available to them because this is such a valuable program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can imagine that a lot of employees didn't know that this even existed, so it'd be great to have that more, you know, out in the in the public realm.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So I think this will be a great partnership with from the employee benefits side where there'll be a lot of synergy and you know, they can. The goal certainly is to communicate more with our employees.'",
