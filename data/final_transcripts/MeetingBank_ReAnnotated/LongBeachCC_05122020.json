        "'speaker_5': 'And I have to say that I myself didn't learn much about it.

I am honored to have your support and I can't think of a better way to continue to serve the city after my'",
        "'speaker_5': 'retirement. We all know that the most important thing is the fiscal health of the port. I will always keep that in mind. As we say, the port's the economic engine of the city responsible for one in five jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I will always keep that in mind. I will never forget the harbor department is a department of the city and I will make sure it always acts to benefit the residents of the state as required by law and benefit the residents of Long Beach as allowed by law.'",

This particular action involves a change to the zoning code to allow the number of pets to be six, where as it was previously four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The zoning code doesn't really have much to do with the animal care services, so this action would also correct that error and move these regulations into the animal section of the municipal code. So with that, that's the summary.'",

I heard from the community that potentially they don't want their neighbors to have six pets except for on a case by case basis where we have fosters and other things that are are'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I did make the motion, but I'm open to changing my motion. I'm just here to listen to the counsel and the input. Other jurisdictions typically do it three dogs, three cats, which therefore could also amount to six animals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But under the way that this is written, someone could theoretically have six cats or six dogs or any other multitude of variances. And I don't know that one. There's a necessity for that at this time. So my inclination would be, and again, I'm open to hearing from my colleagues, my inclination would be to give the ordinance availability'",
        "'speaker_5': ', but a process that it needs to be approved on a regular basis by the animal control director. We have so many barking dog complaints in our community and the process to alleviate barking dogs is very burdensome on our neighbors and often causes neighbor disputes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I am concerned that there would be right now in neighborhoods, often two dogs get along over a fence. That's fine. One additional dog is brought into the mix and mass pandemonium happens. And now if you could put six animals on one property adjacent to another property with 2 to 3 animals, and you're really talking about'",
        "'speaker_5': 'potential noise disturbances to the community. And if the barking dog ordinance was easier to enforce, perhaps I'd be more open to this. But our shelter is empty on a case by case basis. If Mustain wants to make those allowances for those that are foster partners and others that are really strong animal owners, great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we also need to be concerned about animal hoarding and other stories we've heard in the news related to animal neglect. That can happen when people get animals beyond what they can afford or are able to take care of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then as we are going into an economic downturn, we really need to be cognizant of that.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'No. We had somebody calling her to see what's going on with getting her on the line.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, everyone, for being so patient. I apologize. So we did go through a process with our rescue organizations. We also talked in depth about this with our task force. And some of these questions came up. And the concerns, I think, that people have are certainly justified, but they're really not related to the number of animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in a location. And what we're interested in doing is allowing folks to have more animals, of course, that they can reasonably care for. And we have we I think we all probably know somebody that has more than the reported number of animals, and they take excellent care of their pets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we probably may know or have heard of folks that can't really even care for one animal. So when somebody makes a concern or contact animal control regarding the number of animals at a location, we always deal with the welfare issues first, and that's usually how this enforcement goes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So very rarely do we get a call that just says, you know, a citizen is concerned that, wow, there are six dogs here. So we are addressing there are other ways in our municipal code where we address nuisance issues in barking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we already have an ordinance for that. And then we also there are already state codes that deal with animal cruelty and neglect. And what we find is that a number doesn't have really anything to do with either one of those things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Certainly they can exacerbate a situation, but they themselves don't necessarily cause them. So we are very much in support of, as are our colleagues in animal welfare, about raising this limit to hopefully enable people to have more animals, hopefully license more pets and hopefully reduce some of the burden in our shelters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Let me go ahead and go to Janine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mary. Thank you, Stacey. I support staff recommendations. I agree from my experience in the animal world that the number of cats is not necessarily I think six six is a manageable number. And to Councilmember Mungo's point, you know, we want to be able to allow people to foster mother cats with their babies and potentially keep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'them. So we're not putting them back into the system. So while right now we're at a unique moment. I think that the work has been done. The community has been involved in this process. Perhaps there are some other issues that might want to address about how we deal with barking dogs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But my neighbor's barking dog is extremely loud and he's just one dog. So I don't think it's a numbers issue. I think that the community has already spoken. And I would like to ask I'd like to hear from my colleagues, but I definitely would like to keep with the original motion, I need to make a substitute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then I will. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Well, she hasn't changed her motion yet. I just think she doesn't want to change it. Then I'll make a change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's keep going. Constable Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's very your. Yeah. I'm sorry. I was disconnected for a little while, so I missed a lot of the conversation. Not sure where we're at right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The motion still on the floor as it is, but councilman mongo may make some changes. We're having a discussion about the number right now. Let me go back to counting, among other things up next and then maybe we'll get some clarity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman on go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So appreciate the comments of my council colleagues so far. But the community has not been involved. The animal advocacy groups have been involved. And in my opinion, those individuals and animal advocacy are our best cases of the individuals who would be requesting sick animals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm completely supportive of a robust process that allows for animals. But to say that the community has been involved, there have been no public meetings on that except for this council meeting, a council meeting where the public does not have the ability to come and speak on the item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so at this time, I cannot be supportive of moving forward without regard for a process. So my motion will be that I support changing of the ordinance with a process that through licensing, the Director of Animal Services has some discretion over allowing multiple animals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So let me give you an example of this. A few months ago, I was at the shelter and I asked, why are all these animals in this particular cage together? And they were all animals from the same home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in that case. The owner could not take all the animals back because she shouldn't have had that many animals in the first place. And so in that particular case, the Danes stated, okay, well, in this case, we're going to let all the animals go back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You don't have to choose between your animals, but you are not authorized to add any additional animals to the other cases like that. However, we need to be cautious of. Animal care. And there's a very big difference between animal care and animal cruelty and the level of which people believe the animals are part of our family and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not property has definitely shifted. I'd love to see the ordinance reflect animals being not referred to and referred to in a more family oriented way. But at this time, I'd like to add to the motion the approval of the ordinance with a process that they would administer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It can be a very easy going process, but a process nonetheless, so that we at least have a catalog of who these individuals are, how many animals they have, that they don't have a barking dog complaint against their property already.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because currently if you have a barking dog complaint, even if it has not been all the way through the process with a certain number of neighbors sign. And yes, that is a process. We have the strictest barking dog complaint of many of the jurisdictions around us, but it is extremely difficult to enforce extremely and it comes into'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a neighbor to neighbor disputes. So if in the fact that there is a case where a person has several barking dog complaints that have not been able to get through that whole process, and maybe we still maintain the limit of four and four animal I have three animals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is a lot for a family to take care of. And so I would hope that my colleagues will support a process that's necessary to. Yet the 16.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before I move on, I want to clarify because I think. I think what Stacey's customer is asking for essentially is when come to me, correct me if I'm wrong here, but she's saying that ought to be an automatic a trigger that you can just go up to that number you would need to get approval to go beyond'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to get to that, not to get above what currently is the number you would need to get essentially a special license or a special approval from animal care to move into at any higher number than what's currently allowable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you'd still be able to get more animals, but it have to be approved by animal care to make sure that there isn't complaints or issues at that residence. So I think there is definitely could be value in that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I captured that. Right, Councilman?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So the motion is to keep the staff recommendation, but it's not an automatic move. You actually have to add, I kind of have an approval by animal care. I think that's the motion that. The motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman then mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then there's a second councilman's the house the second that I've changed to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I second that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Well, let me move on to council member Austin. Councilman Austin?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we can hear you now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the conversation around this issue. I did have just a couple of quick questions, because one issue that I think I remember brings up a couple of good points. When we define households under this proposed ordinance, the hearing before us, does the household include apartment dwellings, condominiums, townhomes, as well as single family homes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with yards? Is there any distinguishing difference in terms of how many pads can be held in type of living quarters? Anybody as city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has currently dropped it. There's no distinction. Household refers to a family unit, so they could be in any type of dwelling.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think six six pets in tighter living quarters could create a real challenge not only for health and family, but also for neighbors. And so these are. I would love to have animal services director in our department to have some some sort of discretion and in terms of improving that number.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With that in mind, in consideration, I think I support the motion or the spirit of the motion before us. And this is I'm open to further comments, but I think what comes out of this is reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I agree, Councilman, I think this is a good kind of compromise. Councilman Mango's motion is some of the concerns. Councilman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to ask for clarity of our animal department, if it makes sense. To have it go through them, or does it make sense to have it go through the existing pet owners vet that they use?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just I want to understand the process a little more because I know when we talked about this several months ago, I believe that Ms.. Jane said that this was already something that was done regionally, was the number six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think to her point, it was more about this is about animal care. So if it's about animal care with the appropriate person to kind of give the green light, either vet and not animal control and maybe I'm off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if I'm off, then correct me. I'm just trying to make sure that we we make this an easy process for pet owners and for the city. That's a question for city staff. Thank you, Councilwoman Pierce. So. I think the motion takes us maybe in a little bit different direction of the I think the intent of increasing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the number in the ordinance is that we know that most places allow for six pets, some even more than that Sacramento allows, I think, for up to ten. So we know that people do have more than four cats and we know that they do fine with more than four pets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For many people, having a pet is a self-limiting experience anyway. Like, for example, the Councilwoman Mongeau said she has three and that's that's sounds like that was probably her limit. Some other folks have more than that. And, you know, everybody sort of knows their limit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when we were on to complaints, it's not about the number. It's about what's going on in the home. So if the motion is to take this in a different direction, then perhaps. Perhaps the question then becomes the standard of care as opposed to any number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I can take care of 50 animals and not cause a problem for my neighbors, then why shouldn't I be able to have that? Whereas if somebody can't, like I said before, if somebody cannot even care for one animal, then they shouldn't even have the one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in a sense, numbers are particular, can be arbitrary. So I think maybe that that's an important thing to consider. So we will have folks apply for each additional animal after the four and up to the six. Then I guess my question would be, why stop at the six?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So 20 everybody right now. Thank you. Thank you for saying so to clarify that the motion on the floor is essentially still allowing for six is just putting a process in place. So I just want to make sure that process is not strenuous because I know how important it is that all of our pets are licensed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that we can track that. And so that would be my my suggestion if I were to vote yes on this motion is just that that process is not something that is burdensome on staff. So really, my question is, is this a process that you can handle that will not be burdensome on you?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or would you prefer the process a different way? I think we need to take a look at it. I think I need to involve other department staff in answering that question to know what that process is, simply because that's not a process that exists.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we are going to be investigating animal control backgrounds for people and their histories. That definitely would be a process. We'd also need to come up with some criteria of what issues are, for example. Are complaints in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is that a limiting factor? Because do we tell people they can't have certain animals because they have a particular neighbor who has a problem with them and then their issues are really they just don't like that person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I don't want you to have another dog because I have a problem with you, I'm just going to call animal control and make a complaint and then make it more difficult for you to make your own personal, private choices for your life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think it's a little bit more complex if we're going to talk about our process, but certainly we can explore that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And maybe this is time, maybe we can get some clarity on the motion. I understood. I hear two different things. One is more of a of an investigative process where we're really looking to see are people fit to have animals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What I thought I heard the motion was was more keep the six, but you can go up to four and then you just need to put in a application for I want to go above above six. So I think Stacy is trying to figure out how does she make that decision of who is allowed to go above'",
        "'speaker_6': 'six. So that is something if that's the intent of the motion, then we would need to figure out how to go to I'm sorry from above for him to go to 4 to 6.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yeah, let me just jump in also. So I don't want to overcomplicate what I think. I think I actually think the motion is, is fairly simple that's on the floor. I think that also it's essentially the staff recommendation with one key difference, which is that instead of I mean, all pets have to be licensed, should be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'getting licensed anyways. I mean, we know that not everyone does licensing, but that shouldn't there should be licensing. And so I think what the motion is saying is that, yes, you can go to six, but that additional additional pets beyond the four in the process of licensing and getting them approved have to be reviewed by animal care'",
        "'speaker_0': 'just to make sure that it's not that there isn't complaints or there are other issues. Maybe at that residence, if I needed as much simpler maybe than it is, I could be wrong. That was my impression was that it would be a very simple process, but I have two other people queued up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Councilman and day has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You, Mayor? Yes, that's the way I understood it also. So I think that keeping it as simple as possible, I think would address both Councilmember Mungo and Councilmember Pierce's concerns in regards to, you know, not necessarily just giving everybody the go ahead to get six and six pets, but also being careful who those people are who who'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do have six pets and someone that is not being pet friendly wouldn't be able to get those those six. Six Pets Allowance. But then how do you deny that? But also, that may be a little bit more in the staff, some in the staff deciding what what they want to do with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, yes, I think that that's the best thing here, is to keep it as simple and clear as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You impound a large number? Can you hear me now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And again, we have a process to apply to be a breeder. We have a process to apply to be a menagerie. There should be a process for pets. I mean, what we're talking about right now is a triplex that have 18 animals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And maybe that's not the greatest idea. And maybe some of the considerations are the number of animals on a property. Because when you're at 18 cats, you're almost at a cat colony now. And so there are different neighborhood impacts when you have multiple homes like that on a street and other things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not prescribing any process at all. It can be as easy and as simple as possible, and we can start that direction. And as it gets further along, if we see issues that come up, then we can. Encourage a more strict process, but a process is outside of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The ordinance is simple up to six animals through a process. And then let's just leave that to animal control to come up with that process. Another example is you might have an individual who has multiple off leash dog complaints or multiple fence violations, whether animals get out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those are be examples of potential things that those things might want to consider as a part of her evaluation process. But again, right now, if you have more animals and you have that issue, we still return those animals with no conditions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we just want to give her more tools in the toolbox so if problems arise. But yes, as mayor stated, this is very simple.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's I think it's it's not at all changing the intent of staff in working with the rescue groups, which is to allow folks up to six up to six pets. It just be some process that animal care will come up with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It could be very simple. So I don't really think the intent here has been changed at all in my read of potential negative emotion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor, this mayor. Mayor, this is the the one issue that it does raise is this is a substantial change. It will have to come back for a new first reading if the motion that's on the floor is passed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staff would have to come up with some sort of criteria for whatever that process would look like. And then this the ordinance would come back for council to review and approve that with the process included.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ringa, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when has the bureaucracy ever been simple? It's you know, it's much more complicated than what it is. It may sound simple, but it's not. You're looking at terms of defining. What would be a good household to have four or six pets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It becomes very subjective at that point. And not only that, but it becomes a point where there are probably some issues related to the property itself in terms of being able to handle it. What if you have an apartment owner who has prepared for what you want?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Six. That would not be a very good decision right there. So, I mean, I think that Charlie hit the nail on the head. We're going into a discussion here where we need to revisit the process to ensure that all departments are involved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I see I see these are the terms being involved in this, in the decision making process as well, in terms of being able to house that many pets in one property. So I'm thinking that we should remain this audience back to animal control and to U.S. attorney for further review.'",

What I'm going to do is go through a brief verbal summary of this item and then at the request of any council member, we also do have a more extended PowerPoint presentation, if so, to start, but to do the short summary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city zoning code has not been comprehensively updated for more than 30 years, and because of this complex and outdated provisions exist throughout the code, the Planning Bureau conducts periodic tune ups to modernize and improve the readability of the city zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is the item that is before you. This evening, Staff has prepared a series of code amendments that address land use shoes and improve administrative processes. All of the items before you were noncontroversial. When approved by the Planning Commission on February 20th, 2020, I'm going to go through the changes themselves to the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are eight. The first we have a zone C0 and C eight that have been eliminated, but there are still references to in the code this resolves that issue. The second is we have inconsistency in our industrial and commercial zones as to where personal storage can be located.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a restricted use because it does not result in benefits to the city. And this clarifies that the third change is the largest change and I think most important change this evening, which is to allow aerospace, rocketry and space type uses to those type of manufacturers to exist in our industrial areas, including throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a matter of right. These are uses that we lost over time, that when the defense industry and the aerospace industry left the city and we redeveloped the Boeing property as Douglas Park, the whole idea then was to replace those missing jobs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we are the beneficiary of many new high technology rocketry and aerospace uses coming back, and this will provide greater flexibility to those uses to open up, make improvements and operate in the city. The fourth change allows temporary uses that are community serving to exist on vacant lots.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city has a vacant lot registry and fee program and we do allow vacant lots that commit themselves to some public purpose. Be that a location for a crop swap or community gathering or a bike repair station, any use that would be in partnership with the city on that vacant lot to exempt themselves from the fee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this would make a corresponding change to the zoning code to allow those uses on a temporary basis. Number five eliminates prohibitions on storage, attics and accessory structures throughout the city. One of our strategies to improve parking shortages is to make sure that garages are usable by cars, not just by stuff that people accumulate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this will allow greater opportunities to have storage areas, including in attics. Number six would allow our partners at Cal State, Long Beach and City College to operate satellite, publicly run uses within existing storefronts and buildings in the city and providing them a limited exemption from change of use parking requirements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number seven clarifies that if you put up a fabric awning or some type of shade structure, that that's not a height violation and that provide some additional flexibility to property owners to not be in an enforcement situation by trying to have shade during the summer heat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the final item to clarify is that when we do make changes like this and the zoning code, how those apply to our different what we call plan development districts and specific plans throughout the city, and that allows us to have a process going forward to continue making these changes to the code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with that, I'm glad to answer any questions or if there were extensive questions that any council member wanted, the extended presentation that is also available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think I have a motion by Councilwoman Mango. Can I get a second, please? Taken by Councilmember Pierce. Councilman Mongo, any questions?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not before was storage, I think. Hello. Something that was in the presentation that was new to me was storage. I don't think I had understood that this property would allow for storage. I thought we were adding the station, not storage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council member, there were two issues related to storage. The city is very restrictive about where commercial storage, such as self storage, is located. There's no changes being made to that. It's just clarifying that use and using those words self storage, public storage, commercial storage within the zoning code instead of using what's called an SCC code which has'",
        "'speaker_3': 'led to confusion. So that was one change. And then the other change had to do with on residential properties, allowing attics on accessory structures. Right now you can have an attic in your single family home, you can have an attic over your garage if your garage is attached to your home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if you have a detached garage, which most of the historic properties, most of the homes in Long Beach do have detached garages. Right now, you can't have an attic over that garage. This would allow you to have that attic, which gives homeowners an opportunity to store more stuff above their garage and put their car hopefully within'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the garage. So those were the two items dealing with storage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, you know, I'm always supportive of people parking garages. And as long as we weren't saying that the commercial properties would be allowed for self-storage, then I'm very supportive of that and I continue to make the motion. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you. I think that all of these changes are great. Glad to hear that they made them through planning without any issue. I did want to take the opportunity to ask a question about the process for other changes to our code and zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As we know, parking is extremely expensive for developers. We also know that the state has basically said that cities are allowed to make changes that allow for us to count one eve parking spot as two parking spots. And I'm wondering what the process is, because I know we've talked about this the last six months with staff.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'All right, Councilmember, you would not have to bring a separate item if you or the whole of the council want to give that direction to the city manager. We'd be glad to absorb that into our work program, I think, if we were going to tackle that issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's also our issue on our that we need to address at some point having to do with bike parking and whether you can buy a very small amount reduce here required vehicle parking if you put in extra bicycle parking.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Because I think the way the language reads, it could be cleaned up a little bit and it wouldn't be a substantial change to make it either discretionary or obligatory. But in reading it, I felt that the language, the words used were contrary to one another.'",
