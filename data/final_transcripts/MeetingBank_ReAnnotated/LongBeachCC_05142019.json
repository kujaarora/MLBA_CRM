    "New Fees for Shared Micromobility Program.": [
        "'speaker_6': '. So we'll be moving those two items to the top of the agenda and then going from there. So let me begin by doing hearing item number one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Report from Public Works recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution amending the master fee and charges schedule relating to the Shared Microbial City program. Declare Ordinance Amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to Shared Micromobility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Read the first time and lead over the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading and extend the current electric scooter pilot program citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor, council members, the public hearing the buzz word here is microbial city, but it's mostly about e-scooters. I'm going to turn it over to our public works director, Craig Beck, and the traffic engineer Eric Wickstrom.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Pat. Good evening, Mayor. Members, city council. Just wanted to remind you tonight's hearing is to adopt a micromobility ordinance and an associated fee schedule. So if we could have that clicker. Hold on 1/2. Okay. So we wanted to start by just giving a brief update of kind of a background on how we got here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you recall, we issued a pilot program for E-Scooters in July of 2018. We've been monitoring and managing that pilot program ever since. We currently have five operators in the city and about a thousand scooters deployed in different zones across the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've had a call center that's been active throughout our pilot program that allowed us to track questions, concerns, comments about E-SCOOTERS. And the data has shown that it's it's been overall a successful program with about 60 rides per month.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And at the time we made the presentation back in February, staff made a number of recommendations for implementation of a permanent program. And really what we are here this evening is to adopt those recommendations. So as a reminder, E-Scooters, there are some laws in effect and rules that govern our program here in the city, including riders, must'",
        "'speaker_9': 'be 18. You are not allowed to ride e-scooters on the sidewalk and you need to make sure that you're appropriately parking them when you're done and that they aren't in conflict with Ada in within our right of way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And even though the state law has changed in January of this year, not requiring helmets for the riders to say, the city still continues to encourage helmet use for riders safety. So what are we talking about for a permanent program?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We are bringing back at council's direction. We are limiting the issuance of permits to only six vendors and initially that would be for 4000 total units. Those units would increase to 6000 after six months, assuming everybody are following the guidelines and safely operating the devices.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vendors will be required to provide anonymous data to the city. To our third party vendor. We want to be able to track where scooters are being used, how they're being deployed, making sure that they are appropriately following the requirements and the limits to to align with the permit that they're issued.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's also very important that vendors have the ability to geofence their devices. We believe that this is an important component, and we know now that we will be restricting rider access to certain areas. Parks are an example. Belmont Pier is an example.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there's going to be certain areas within the city that we want to restrict where scooters would go. Vendors must create an incentive for parking within the designated drop zone. So this is proven to be successful. During our pilot program is the placement of drop zones and placement of the scooter devices within those drop zones as they'",
        "'speaker_9': 'balance them every morning. But we wanted to take that a step further and follow something similar to what we do with our bike share program, and that is actually to incentivize the users to park in a hub. And if they do that, we'll leave it up to the vendors to create that incentive, whatever that may be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It could be a credit for a ride or however they want to do that. But we will be looking for that incentive to ensure compliance with this important component of our program. It's important that they come up with a fair that reduces costs to our low income community that we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We want riders of all incomes levels to have access to the SCOOTER program, and we'll be looking for the vendors to create that that rate structure. We want to provide support. We want the vendors to provide support for the deployment of their devices and their customers so they can't just drop them in the city and disappear.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We want to make sure that they have a presence here and work with our staff to promote safe usage and also educate their riders on safe usage. Vendors must work with the city to provide data. As I mentioned, that's going to include a whole host of things, not only the heat maps of where they're going to be'",
        "'speaker_9': 'written, but we want to know about maintenance reports. We want to know that the writers are following program rules. We want to know if they have accidents. So if writers are injured, we want that to be in the data.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We really want to get a full picture of the usage and what's working well and areas that we may need to focus on for improvement. Lastly, we want to make sure that they work with us for special events that may be moving scooters out of the way for special events.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For example, filming in a given area. Or redeploying more units if we have a large event and need more access. We also want to make sure that they'll quickly respond to emergencies and remove their devices if we so desire.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Part of the action tonight includes the adoption of new fees. And just as a reminder, when we brought this item forward in February, council requested staff to take a look at our fee structure and look for opportunities to reduce our fees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you recall, at that time, we were proposing a $120 annual per unit fee and a $40 annual per unit fee in our disadvantaged communities. After we've spent some time reviewing how this would be implemented, we found challenges to add to the fee structure in our disadvantaged in our disadvantaged communities, meaning how would we know what scooters'",
        "'speaker_9': 'were within those areas and what scooters weren't? And so we're proposing this evening that we have a flat fee of $100 per unit annually, and that that would allow us to fund the necessary elements for this program, including what we would need for staffing to manage this program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Council also asked us to confirm what fees were being charged in other cities. I think that there was an indication at the time that maybe other cities were reducing those fees. We've checked with the cities in Southern California listed here, and the information we received back is that those fees have not changed since we presented in February'",
        "'speaker_9': '. And as a reminder, those fees are in this table here. So to successfully implement this program, the fees are an important element. When we looked at the data that we received through the pilot program, we're estimating that the vendors earned about $1.6 million in revenue on about a thousand units that were deployed throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we feel that it's important to include the fee elements so we can achieve some of the goals that council has tasked staff with, ensuring that that we're addressing scooters that are parked in inappropriate areas that were there to address concerns expressed by our community and also to do special enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We want to work closely with Long Beach PD to say, for example, to do special enforcement, to address any riders that are using scooters on the sidewalk as as an example. So what are our next steps if council moves forward and adopts this ordinance this evening?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Staff will work to implement the new permit application. All current vendors will have to reapply. They'll need to apply under the new permanent program guidelines and rules. They'll have to affirm that they're going to follow those rules. They will be assessed to ensure that they meet all of the program requirements and then issued a permanent permit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we will also ask staff through the hiring of the the MICRO-MOBILITY coordinator will take on the responsibility of the drop zones. So under the pilot program, the vendors where we're placing the decals. The city wants to take that on to ensure that the decals are kept up and maintained.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're finding that some of the decals out in our communities are getting worn and we want to ensure that they are appropriately placed. A But B, we also plan on changing some of the information in our drop zone decals.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For example, we're going to add information to remind scooter riders that they cannot ride on the sidewalks. So the decals would then say no riding on the sidewalk. So that would be an element of the program as as council directed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Once we get this up and running, we would come back to council with a report in six months. And if at that juncture, everyone seems to be in compliance with all the program rules and requirements, we would then move from an authorized number of 4000 units to 6000 units citywide.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that concludes our staff report, and we're available to answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Beck. Let me turn this over to Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So and thank you, Mr. Beck, for the presentation. And we've been following the conversation around scooters for a long time, and we see them distributed and being utilized. And thank you for bringing this this this hearing tonight to adopt this resolution, this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we raised up the conversation. And it's not new that we want to make sure with everything we do, we place a lens of equity, economic equity, environmental equity on how we deploy these technologies. And we've seen some examples here in Long Beach where with Bikeshare, for example, we said we will go out and ultimately get to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'other parts of town, North Long Beach, things like that. And, you know, for one reason or the other, a vendor or whatever it was, things happen and it doesn't. And it never the bikes never made it to North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we have an opportunity and I think we need to. The lesson I've learned from that is that we need to put these things in the policy on day one as we design and build the program. And so I wanted to talk through some different components here, and I'm interested in moving forward with a first reading tonight'",
        "'speaker_7': ', but I will have some, some tweaks to the ordinance here. So one, you know, at the conversation at SCAD and you know, I'm involved at SCAD, we're we're we're noticing that these ordinances across the region are intentionally calling out equity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How are we calling our equity in this ordinance, in this program here today?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilman Richardson? I think we're we're approaching that in two ways. One, as I mentioned, we would be seeking the vendors to create a rate structure to ensure that those of low income in our inner city have access to the scooters.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The other is we would deploy across zones and the zones in the city would allow us to authorize X number of units in a zone. So we wouldn't simply, as an example, say vendor A gets a thousand units to deploy wherever they want to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vendor A would get approval for a thousand units X number in zone one, x number in zone two, X number in zone three, etc. And by doing that, it allows us to align the distribution of our units across our city and across those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sounds great and I think that's a good foundation and I may want to take it a bit further and just sort of call out some goals or some requirements here. Now, in paying attention to LA's Department of Transportation, they've required their providers to have insurance and liability.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do we have that? Is that a requirement or program that the providers have insurance and liability insurance?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is. Okay. Great. Is and I noticed you referenced that we want them to remain committed to the community. Is that going to be codified in the plan?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe that's something that will be implemented by staff as part of their program that's so specifically addressed in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I guess if I could, I think the answer from my perspective would be that if we find that a vendor isn't committed to this program and the program rules, that we would withdraw their application and their permit and they would not be allowed to operate in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think by doing that, it does achieve a certain element of commitment to Long Beach and success in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly. And so the Los Angeles program has it requires the insurance and liability. It requires a community engagement plan. So they call out what their commitment is going to be, and then they measure. And based on that plan and then thirdly, an equity plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we touched on most of that here. And so my hope is that we get an opportunity for them as sort of for us to look at what their plan is for ensuring that they have a rate structure and all those things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The other thing that I think is really interesting that I think we should apply here is that so in LA's program, they set a goal for disadvantaged communities and in 62% of their scooters in the city of L.A. are required to operate in these disadvantaged communities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they called out 62%. They looked at how many disadvantaged communities that they had in L.A. and said, look, it should be proportional, right, to the disadvantaged communities. And so here in Long Beach and they use the cal enviro screen, they use the Calvin Great Enviro screen, 3.0.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, what I'd like to see is, since we already have since we already have zones, I'd like to see a goal of 40%, a requirement of 40%, not 62, like L.A. would do 40 in zones that overlap with the coronavirus green rating, 70 or 80 and above.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we'll give you some flexibility on how you programmatically design that. But I want to set a requirement here in this in this in this motion. So that will be in my motion, hoping for a reaction. Bart's response reaction?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are you asking for a second or are you asking for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's not emotion yet. I want your feedback.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think that that is something we could certainly implement. As I mentioned, when you start to look at the zones, we could easily align our zones within our disadvantaged communities and that would allow us to to both implement and then monitor the success of that implementation of a goal or a target for distribution across those communities'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Thank you. And I think the way that the ordinance is structured, we should be able to put in a requirement without triggering in the first reading again. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think if you do it as part of the implementation plan by staff, I think that it wouldn't trigger it wouldn't trigger a new first reading. I think if we amend the ordinance, that's not currently something that's in it and it probably would trigger.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In the first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Reading. So we can require it as a part of the program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you can you can direct staff or request that staff implemented.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. That's what I like to do. And then and then finally, in terms of I know that we initially proposed sort of a two step program in terms of fees where, you know, there were sort of two rates.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And now the staff proposal is come up with one rate, $100, and then the programs come up with their all their other fee schedule. I would like to see. So when do we plan on coming to that? Coming back in the next six months.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Okay. I would like. I would like to see not just the low income discount, but those operators who are who are operating within those zones that we describe, those disadvantaged zones. I think they should get a discount for having operating in those zones, as well as an incentive to make sure that sort of there's no gaming'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of the system and that sort of we're incentivizing engagement in these areas that really have been left out of the mobility conversation. So that's something we can do. Mr.. Back in the next six months.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. And I think, you know, the challenge that staff is is faced with currently is that we're not getting good data from the vendors. And so for us to implement a discounted rate structure for X-number of of scooters that align with our disadvantaged communities, we don't know how to verify in an audit that data.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think the request would be, from at least as perspective, is that we move forward with the $100 rate that we get the data from the vendors as we're were requesting through the program. And assuming that that data is as extensive as we believe it will be, it would allow us then to kind of verify and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have kind of a milestone where we would know how many units were within those areas that they are meeting, the targeted goal that's adopted tonight. And then we would come back in and share that with council and then at that time, maybe council could adopt a reduced rate program that would be staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. So I think that satisfies what I need. I think the motion here, the conversation here, we have to intentionally call out the outcomes we want to see in the policies we put forward. And we've, you know, we've done the the hopes and dreams.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We hope that the market drives things to go in certain areas. And it just you know, there's too many factors. The technology changes too fast. There's problems with vendors. We have to write into the policy on day one to make sure that, you know, this is, you know, something that's useful to people who actually need it as'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a transit solution. And in north lobbies, for example, you know, a lot of the technology is being deployed, is considered last mile, but we're well over a mile to connect to the blue line. You either have to head south to the Waterloo Station or you have to head west to the Compton station.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're really thinking about not last mile, technology's last two mile or last two and a half mile. And so we have to make sure that we're inclusive of all our areas of town when we create these policies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is consistent with the movement that's happening all across the region, this conversation on on transit, transit, equity and mobility as as an equity as it relates to mobility. So that's my motion staff's recommendation with the 40% goal of with 40% requirement in disadvantaged communities as defined by cal enviro screen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we'll leave some flexibility there on whether it's, you know, 60, 70, I think 70 or 80 is the range. And then secondly, that we we come back in the next six months after collecting some data with some sort of incentive fee program for those those operators.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's my motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrew. Second that motion. I think we're gonna go back to Vice Mayor. Right. You said okay, considering. I'm actually I apologize. I was scrolled down there. So. Councilmember Pierce, then Councilmember Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I think I spoke a lot on this whenever it was in council. The last time I've read through everything, I've had many conversations. I think, is that a good place? I support the motion on the floor by Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did want to just clarify and then ask one one question for the six vendors that could eventually include e-bikes. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, Councilwoman. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, wonderful. And then I wanted to ask. Oh, sorry. It's hard to talk. Thanks. I wanted to clarify that on the decals that we're putting that the city will be implementing those. We had a conversation with your team and one of our neighborhood associations, District one around decals and trying to make sure that we are cohesive, that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we don't have five different types of decals on our sidewalks, that there's not enough room for that, that it's ADA compliance. And I believe the conversation was taking a similar design, at least in the downtown area, where it's explicit that you can't ride bikes or scooters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would that be included in this program outside of just the where they're the parking station?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think right now our recommendation is we're concerned about the proliferation of decals on our sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that we should do that in a cohesive way. And what we're what we believe we can do is accomplish some of the goals of the neighborhood communities, which is to remind riders, both bicycle riders and e-scooter riders, that they're not allowed to ride on our sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we think we can do that within our drop zones. We're going to revise the one that we use during the pilot program and shrink the footprint a little bit, but add more information about not not riding on sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that hopefully answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And I I guess I wanted to make sure that as we come back down the road, that we continue to have a conversation if we feel like those decals are enough, because we did have neighborhood associations that wanted to pay for them themselves and put them on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so to keep from making sure that we don't have four different kinds out there. I would rather the city do it with the city logo on it and that you manage the entire program. So I just wanted to make sure that we talked about that publicly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the other component, I just want to echo Richardson's comments. I mean, I know that we've seen that some people are riding these up to seven miles, you know, distance. And so I again, for that reason, I support the motion that he's made and look forward to hearing the council comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much, Councilman. Your income.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. For clarification, this is this continues to be a pilot program. Where we with we actually putting it out to RFP for people to apply and get more of a permanent contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the adoption of the ordinance. You will be entering a phase where it's a permanent program. I think staff's recommendation tonight is to continue the the the pilot program until the ordinance becomes final.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then at that point, we're requiring those who have already been in the pilot program to reapply for the permanent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'License or whatever. You know, right now you have of what bird line readership and spin and you. We have up to six. So that's five. Is there a61 available or is there one in the loop? Is there an RFP for one or what was the process?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So to address that, we purposely are calling this a micromobility program because we we look at the guidelines that we're proposing here this evening would apply to a vendor that wanted to bring in e-bikes as an example. So our goal would be that we would have the ability to go up to to issue up to six permits'",
        "'speaker_9': 'citywide for both e-scooters and e-bikes not to exceed assuming everything works out after the six month period of time frame. 6000 units citywide between both E-Scooters and e-bikes. We're not saying that the the vendors that are currently operating in the pilot program will get a permanent permit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They're going to have to display that they can implement all of the requirements of the permanent program that they have geofencing as described that they're going to achieve the need for delivering data and that they're going to be responsible for managing their system within our city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, again, we're not making any guarantees. We're going to take applications on a first come, first serve basis. We're going to evaluate them for compliance with our program and then issue the permits from there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm glad to hear that because in your report you did mention that there are some of these vendors who are having been I don't see that compliant but have not been providing some real good data to you for you to evaluate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm concerned that these vendors who already have a track record of perhaps not being as open and cooperative with you and providing you data that they're going to be rewarded with a contract. So, I mean, I don't want to see that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I hope that during the review process that you will be very strict and very forceful in asking for compliance with all facets of the program that we have put in place and that we will get a very good program here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I basically agree with the comments of my my two previous colleagues in regards to the equity components and having the availability of more scooters in other parts of the city that are not traditional for these types of mobility transportation options.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm talking about the West Palm Beach area in my side of town, and so I'm hoping that we can address those sometime in the very near future. And that's it for now. I'll continue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I think a couple of my questions have already been answered. So I'm going to do what I can to be efficient with my time here. The. The the term. Abandoned Scooter can cause somebody to define what that actually means.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I guess from staff's perspective, an abandoned scooter would be a scooter that maybe was tossed in the Colorado lagoon or was thrown on top of a building. Those are not just misplaced or parked poorly. Those were intentionally. We're using the term abandoned.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You could say, um, I don't know, vandalized or something, but. But we're trying to ensure alignment that we're taking care of any wayward scooters out in our community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Well, it seems to me that that that that that particular term can be misinterpreted by by anybody. Right. It can mean something different to somebody else. And so it probably I would feel a lot more comfortable if we could kind of find that out and be clear specific on what that means.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because I you know, we get constituent calls and, you know, if a scooter's parked in front of somebody's home, you know, there's a neighbor who may may view that as an abandoned scooter versus being found in a Colorado lagoon.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So just my comments on that. And in light of just some recent. Current affairs. Is there is the city indemnified for any. Criminal acts that may be. Use for scooter or a scooter may be used for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city is not not currently the language in the ordinance does not currently address criminal acts. No. Yeah that kind of isn't a standard part of the of public right of way permits.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if somebody assaults somebody with a scooter. Right. Would the city be liable or not?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, if it's if it's there's I mean, I guess it sort of depends on what area we're talking about. But if there's a criminal act, I would expect that the first thing that would happen would be that the police department would take care of whatever that is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if there was a subsequent civil lawsuit that involved the city, it would have to get addressed from there. But since that's sort of a circumstance that's not terribly common in this kind of public right of way permit, that's not something that's addressed in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would probably be addressed kind of on a case by case basis as it arose. Unless people anticipate that this is something that will be happening more often.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I. Never thought that I would think it was. So some things happen at their unthinkable, but but then they happen. And so you have to think about that as well. And so I think I would love to see an indemnification clause if possible in this, and I'd be very interested in hearing from my colleagues as well'",
        "'speaker_8': 'about that. And then to Councilmember Richardson's original motion regarding the equity, I certainly support that. You know, we want to make sure that this mode of transportation and these modes of clean transportation are available to everybody in our community no matter what their income level is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so if there's a way to add in, I think this this ordinance certainly addresses much of that. I did have a question regarding the 40% number and whether or not that is that goes far enough. And how did you arrive at that, that number?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Thank you. So in looking at the Cal enviro screen, the higher you go in the column virus, Green says, you know, the more pollution or more polluted the environment is in those areas, 70%, 70 or above on cal enviro screen essentially covers all of downtown west central Long Beach and north.'",
        "'speaker_7': '40% go there already doing that. I'm pretty confident they're already doing that by being in the in the downtown. The hope is that the way that staff designs the program of it is distributed across the six zones and prioritized, you know, that 40% is met by making sure that sort of the three or so zones that will'",
        "'speaker_7': 'overlap north central west those coronavirus green areas have some some goals called out in those areas. So that would be sort of required to operate sort of equitably across town. So that's the idea. So 40, it could potentially be higher, L.A. to 68.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think given this is a new concept, I didn't want to go too aggressive here. I think if they can meet 40 in the next six months and we see data, we can have a conversation about, you know, whether that number needs to be adjusted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think 40% is. It just seemed like a fair number.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I applaud the effort. I guess it would probably help me if I had a coronavirus screen in front of me. That data in front of me. Okay, I don't need to see that. And it is that is that B and is that the only methodology that we can look at?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, let's just Los L.A. do what he did. And it made sense. And it's the conversation at SCAD. So this is just sort of a measurement. There could be others, it could be poverty, it could be a number of different things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But CALLEN Virus screen the environment typically tracks along the same indicators as poverty in others. And actually Cal Virus screen actually is a little bit more fair because it says whether you're in poverty or not, if you have, you're dealing with a bunch of automated, you know, a bunch of pollution due to mobile sources, then you need'",
        "'speaker_7': 'these scooters too. So I think it's a little more sort of bizarre.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you're going to have to share that screen with me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I got you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then they sent in a spirit of moving this this item. I certainly will support this. But I think we also have some time over the next six months, a year to recognize and tweak the program if necessary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the ordinance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Excellent comments from my colleagues. And I support anything we can do to incentivize distribution of the scooters throughout the city. Because if I'm not mistaken, the deployment and activation of the scooters thus far has been mostly in council districts two and three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Beck.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Council member we have distribution across the city. There have been the majority of them tend to find themselves along the coast line. Correct. So one, two and three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that the biggest concern for my district is, of course, the abandoned scooters. You know, they are resembling a type of litter. In terms of what the residents are experiencing. They're in the middle of sidewalks. So we've had residents trip over them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They end up in planters, roundabouts, traffic circles, Colorado Lagoon, all manner of places. So I think once they're utilized more actively in other districts, some of those impacts might be felt more prevalently by some of my colleagues. And they'll understand that the need for some of the the concerns that I have and the protections that I'm hoping'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we have in place. We did have a number, a call center number for residents to call and address violations. And my understanding is that that call center is no longer active. So if we roll out this new program, what what is the city going to do to help facilitate resident concerns?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So. Councilmember That's correct. We had a POW with a third party vendor that was operating a call center for us and that PO has hit its limit. So we are looking at how we would re-implement that. We'll either do a a new PO for that vendor or B, take it in-house.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're looking right now at what that would entail to bring the call center in-house and make that decision once we have that data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, that's excellent.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But definitely to answer your question, we absolutely believe having a call center is important to the success of this program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Excellent. Thank you. Is it possible for us to be able to add abandoned scooters or dump scooters to the Go Long Beach app as one of the options?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll have to check. I believe it's on there. I could be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's well, we have dumped items which, by the way, I use for just about every category that I can't find.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But if it's not on there, we can certainly add it. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And thank you. And the reason for that is I know a lot of the scooter companies like Bird, for example, has a really great feature on their app where you can report dump scooters. But the problem is expecting the residents to have, you know, all six apps on their phone is a lot to ask.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we could have a go along beach access, that would be fantastic. What I know we talked in the past about selecting vendors that have geofencing, technology available so that we can have some control over speed limits and of course, access points for the scooters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that still a priority for us and what's our status on that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. Not only is it a priority, it's an absolute requirement under the new program if if a vendor does not have the ability to limit or restrict scooter access in certain areas of the city as we designate, then they're not going to be issued a permit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Excellent. And are they the vendors required to carry insurance? I think Councilman Austin just asked about this, but just a little bit more directly. Is is there is the scooter company required to have insurance?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have talked a lot about. Resources for enforcement and using the revenue collected from this program to put it right back into enforcement. Is that still our plan? And what does enforcement look like?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I think the first goal of staff is to hire a mobile MICRO-MOBILITY coordinator so we can ensure that all the things that we're talking about this evening are being implemented. The goal is that we would hopefully still have some revenue available to a to work with PD to do specialized enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what I mean by that is it would depend on the chief's direction on how he would deploy this, but maybe either officer overtime or a special unit that would go into certain areas and enforce things like riding the wrong way on the street and not obeying traffic laws, writing on the sidewalk, etc., and kind of do'",
        "'speaker_9': 'an enforcement zone to ensure we have compliance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's great. I would like to take that a step further and ask Councilman Richardson if I can add a friendly to his motion. And the friendly would be that for the first six months that this project is rolled out while we're.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Working with the 4000 number. But before we go to the 6000 number that the chief of police work with his command staff to identify one day per month where directed enforcement is conducted on sidewalks or business corridors for scooter enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the reason I think that's important is because for a lot of our business corridors, this impacts the businesses being able to have clear sidewalks. And the chief of police can determine, based on the hotspots what areas are getting the most use and once a month direct a directed enforcement action in a community where there's a lot'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of use and so that we can have that data.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I like the idea of doing some enforcement. I would want to hear from staff specifically about the count. So. Yeah, so. So anyway, in the past we've always been careful not to direct very specifically, but in more in general to say work into your work and enforcement program in if you want to make it general and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'they can respond to it. I'm happy with accepting that, right? Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, it would be the chief that would make that determination. But I just want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That, no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not begging for directed enforcement every month. If I feel like there's a need that it's baked into this policy, that we have some resources that we're setting aside for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Chief, would you like to just respond.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'd like to jump in there a little bit. So we like that direction. Please let us know that, you know, in general, you'd like to do that. We'll work that. And I'll let the chief talk in a second.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Work that into the program as possible. We will also be bringing back in the FY 20 budget an actual plan for the number of positions that we're going to be hiring. So if you saw in the staff report, we are not going to wait to the 20 budget to bring the first person on and who will bring'",
        "'speaker_10': 'on the staffing. We need to get this going because we need to be ready day one when this gets going. But then you'll see in the Fy20 budget what our what our enforcement plan will be and the various components.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, except it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, so I think motion's been accepted. Councilman Richardson, you're not sure?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just one more thing. I forgot to. I forgot to mention to raise up. So, you know, I saw a presentation where Uber showed how they're preparing the Uber app to be able to show not just their vehicles, but the transit time on the bus, the transit time on the, you know, the blue line and on bikes and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'scooters all integrate in one platform. So when someone pulls up, let's say Uber or Lyft, you'll see, okay, it may take me 20 minutes in a car. It may take me 30 minutes on a scooter. It may take me this long.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And what the what the prices are. And that's the future of like fully integrated multi modality. That's where things are heading. But we have to make sure that we're starting the conversation now with this ordinance to set some, you know, start thinking about as that technology comes online, how are the vendors we're working with today ready to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'participate? Should that technology be created? And even metros thinking about doing the same thing where you have one integrated app where everything else can kind of feed in and so have you. Are you familiar with this?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. BECK Yes, Councilmember. I think that that not only the app you're talking about, but Google is doing that as well as they start talking about drive time and different modes of travel. And I think one thing that I would add, while we're talking about transportation this evening, many of the companies that are engaged in this are'",
        "'speaker_9': 'really technology companies. And so they're striving for the latest technology. And and it's a competitive marketplace. So early adopters are going to tend to be more successful in tech as technology changes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, great. So I know there's, you know, more questions and we'll have another bite at the apple on some of this when we talk about the phasing to 6000 bikes. But I want to make sure that we do have the opportunity should technology become available to require require this in the future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much, Councilmember Super.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I had a brief follow up on Councilman Price's issue about retrieving scooters via the Go Long Beach app. If that could be, I'm not sure how you would do this, but if it could be brand neutral, then someone who spots a scooter at the curb or on a front lawn in the middle of the night'",
        "'speaker_7': 'wouldn't have to go outside and identify the brand prior to reporting. It may not be doable, but it sure would be ideal if we had a system that way. The other hour I'd just like to ask staff. So my understanding is that the fee was reduced to the vendors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Did that go from one tow to 100?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. At the stats recommendation and when we made the presentation back in February that we would charge $120 a unit per year and that we would charge $40 a unit per year in our disadvantaged communities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So so my question is, what for that reduction? If that was in negotiation, what did we get in return? If anything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Staff are recommending the $100 per unit annually, and it certainly counsels discretion to amend that and come up with a different amount.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. It. Was there anything? Can you give us any background on on why that was reduced? Because we're just looking at a different figure today than we looked at it February. Help you understand my position.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, certainly. So when this item was presented to council in February, the staff was clearly directed with the adoption of the item to go back and review opportunities to come back with a lower fee. We looked at different opportunities and I want to remind the Council we're not negotiating a contract with these vendors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're outlining a permit process which vendors can apply for. So this really isn't a negotiation we're going to detail. This is our program. If you want to operate in Long Beach, this is what you're going to have to comply with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so trying to meet council's request, we're coming back with a recommendation of $100 annually.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So there are not enhanced services or anything like that that that have a nexus here in the reduced fee is just what what staff has set as what would be ideal moving forward. But it's not contractual. It's a guideline at this point in my understanding that I do want to put words in your mouth.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But is it fair?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I wouldn't say it's ideal or that it's a guideline. It will be the permit fee that we charge a permit to or a vendor that's issued a permit. So what council's adopting tonight would go into the fee ordinance and it would be a fee that is charged for anyone who operates under this program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I guess maybe I'm mystified how this is reduced from February to today's date and I'm just don't have a good feel for supporting something with with what we an agreed upon amount in February and now it's less so I remain mystified thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you so much for the report. Just a couple questions clarifying here. The data sharing, when.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would be the soonest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'd be able to see any data come back and what does that look like?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Our goal is that we would receive reports monthly. So the ordinance I think would go in effect 30 days after the second reading. So yeah, so sometime in, say, late June, the ordinance would be in effect. Our goal is that by that time we would have the applications out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We anticipate already having permits in hand that we would be reviewing or applications in hand that we would be reviewing and ready to issue those permits. So in general terms, we anticipate starting to receive reports in the August, September timeframe.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then we would build that data and come back to council six months after the ordinance goes into effect with a report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. And then the drop zones, there's 230 drop zones right now. I know it's mixed, you know, all over the city. Do we have a general did we get a map before? I'm trying to remember whether we had a map of where the drop zones were at.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I can provide a map to you. When we came in February, there was a report that detailed some of that, and it also included, I think there was a good page that showed a heat map, so where people were starting and concluding their ride and it really showed some of the more popular routes that people were'",
        "'speaker_9': 'using scooters on. 230 is what we have today. I don't anticipate that number or I do anticipate that number will significantly grow as we work to achieve all the goals that we've talked about tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, great. So I guess we'll look forward to that. More information coming back in August or so. But it'd be good to have an idea of, you know, if anything is changing with the drop zones and where they're located.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if I could add just for information for everybody, I think part of the goal here is that we need to work with the vendors. So if a vendor comes to the city and says, we were really interested in deploying on Corner X, that we would be flexible enough to work with them to determine that that is'",
        "'speaker_9': 'an appropriate location for a drop zone. So maybe they put a couple scooters out for a couple of weeks. They evaluate the success of that location. They come back to city and say, Yeah, this is successful location for us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We want this to become a drop zone. Then the city would go out there and formalize it and put down the decals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's it's changing and evolving. Great. Thank you. And then the last comment and I, I speak to a lot of the comments that my colleagues have made as well in terms of ensuring that we're cleaning up our sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know we're on top of all that, and especially the equity piece and making sure we can expand into areas that will absolutely use utilize these these scooters. But my last comment is for I have received a lot of comments, especially with people with different abilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If there is a way for us to engage the Citizen Advisory Commission on Disabilities, just to put it on the agenda and maybe as we are, you know, working through the various drop zones and with the vendors just to ensure that they have some opportunity to weigh in on this would be very helpful, I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much for the report and I look forward to seeing what we can do here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Any public comment on the hearing? We have one on the top. So let me do the one on the top. Go ahead, Mr. Rockwell. And then if you're going to speak, please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've had problems with the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr.. I actually I don't know where the mic is on up there. Yeah. Keep going, Mr. Rockwell. We can hear you, but it's okay. Got it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of the scooters have been left in various locations along this street between Magnolia and Pine Avenue, in front of my apartment and front of the building next door to mine at 439 West Fifth Street, also in front of 225 West Street, they've been left in front and blocking the access to get in to Rite Aid at'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Six and Pine and Walgreens at Saks and Long Beach Boulevard. They have blocked the way to get in to other businesses and get along the sidewalk in front of many businesses on Broadway as well as first while not first Street, third straight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they have I have found them over my target on Bellflower and Stearns and blocking the access to get off the curb cut at the south end of that mall to cross the street Cross Stearns Avenue, going across to the mall on the south side where it serves as that has been a real pain in my psyche'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as far as these scooters are concerned. I've seen two people riding the same scooter at least five times within the last two weeks. I had one just of two people, two scooters coming directly at me. One night, about 10:00 at night, as I was going home from First Congregational Church and going up cedar between third and now'",
        "'speaker_5': 'between fourth and fifth Street on Cedar. And now scooters are coming directly at me. I had no way to go and I didn't know what I was going to do. And both of them helped me one on one side and one on the other side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not bad enough to cause major damage, but it was very disconcerting and was scaring me half to death because you see these two lights coming down the sidewalk. You know, it's scary. And I feel that for those of us in wheelchairs, that's that's really bad and especially one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one day I found six of the scooters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Left.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the middle of the curb cut back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Rockwell. Thank you very much. We have I'm going to close the speakers list. So I have the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven folks in line and the speakers list is closed. So no one else, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Larry. Good. You address on file. At first. An objective person looking at things for a city like a Long Beach, they'd say the very concept is divorced from intelligence. But of course, on that, they'd be wrong. They'd be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because that implies that at some point, at some point, it had a nexus to intelligence, which clearly it does not in a city. Such as Long Beach. And you just heard some very, very solid reasons why not. Insurance is not an issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Obviously, they get insurance. But the person that's permanently disabled or seriously disabled for months or weeks. That's irrelevant. Simply irrelevant. There's absolutely no reason why with proper planning. People can not get it. It would stop them from going about their daily routine, whether it be on a bike, at a bus or train.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This, though, is just. Absolutely. A financial catastrophe for the city. Period. You can insure just to a certain point that it will get to where it's beyond that is catastrophic. There's no reason why the people can't rely either on the Buster Brown Express to get them from a train or a bike.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You've just heard all the other reasons why. But this is going to be a financial disaster for the city, if you imply if you implement this. Consider moving, encouraging people if you have to develop a plan for people, showing them, all right, if you're in this area, you can take this bus, stay there, take the train or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'take the bus to Brown Express. But this city does not have the money. To cover the liability that will fall upon this city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jared and Karen retired, a resident of District one. And Councilmember Richardson, thank you for reminding us that we need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To look forward to what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our mobility issues are going to be in the future. They're changing very, very rapidly. We're talking about scooters next year. They'll be totally something different. And I have a lot of faith in Eric and his staff to be thoughtful about what kind of mobility issues we're going to require.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You've talked a lot about the technicalities, but not about the people costs. As I was waiting to catch the bus last night over on Fourth in Orange by the senior center, I saw a young man with spy on the scooter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With his dog. It's very dark over there. And I heard a laugh that the dog wasn't laughing. Turned out he had his probably five year old daughter in front of him on the scooter. This is not the first time I've seen parents that are willing to jeopardize their children's lives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To give them a ride on the scooter. I've seen children as young as six driving these scooters. So I think whatever instruction that there needs to be to the community really needs to be emphasized that these are not for children or people under the age of 18.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The medical staff that I work with. When I inquired, have Akin indicated that they're seeing more entries, face fractures from scooters because people are not wearing helmets, so they lay on face first. And it's not necessarily with car collisions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's because the scooters still stop abruptly or they have dramatic drops or shifts in the speed level of the scooters. So people need to understand that these can be dangerous, they're not secure. So I would like to see in the ordinance that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dogs are not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Allowed to be running alongside the scooters where they can't be seen or anywhere. And that there are the equity provisions include older adults and the disabled so that they have opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I saw that the electric bikes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have been dropped, were dropped a couple of weeks ago and they're in heavy use. And I'm always surprised about the number of older adults that I talked to that have tried the scooters and really, really like them, but they'd like the more stable platform once so that they can ride them to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then in the studies they looked at, the lower income communities generally use the devices more prevalently because they're less likely to have cars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. Good evening. My name is Michael Parish, member of District seven. I really do support the idea of a micro-mobility for the city. However, I think regulating it to the degree that we expect it to be the regulation that we're expecting to levy on it isn't going to provide those affordability metrics necessary for these companies to be'",
        "'speaker_5': 'profitable. Just looking at the the earn value they had last year was 1.6 million. As mentioned, there was a thousand units in operation. It's only about 1600 dollars per year for each of these units to to to make.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then you start adding in the acquisition costs of approximately $350 per unit. And in my research, I found that most of these units only lasts for 30 days or less. So these companies are going to have to continually by and by and replace broken units.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But then we're going to be placing a very hefty per unit burden on them to continue operations. There's got to be a point where they're going to decide that this isn't really feasible, remarkable for them. And the city is going to be left without a solution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the city really should consider reducing the fee per unit for these units until we can understand what the point of the fee is. I understand there's a coordinator coming, but last year we put in coming years are potentially going to raise $400,000 of just unit fees plus the continual licensing for each company to be allowed'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And then this affordable solution is not going to be available and people are going to have to go back to driving cars, taking the bus or other mechanisms like writing their own personal bike or own personal scooter.

We request that council require that all operators physically demonstrate their technology around show speed and geofence before approving being approved to operate.

        "'speaker_12': ', because they haven't given you guys the data yet. But, you know, truth be told, I think people are only using bird lime. And thankfully, now that they've gotten the the e-bikes now raised, they probably bumped up a little on the market share.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'I was using a lime to be to be frank. But I didn't see one scooter in that 7.6 mile journey that was available. That is a clear sign that they are not coming to up to the standards that are agreed upon in this pilot program in regards to the affordability map.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You know, and I think I think 40% is too low. For example, you know, I got the weekends off. I rode a scooter from Vermont and sunset all the way down to South Central. I wrote it to 86th.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And when I was in L.A., I rode from Vermont in sunset all the way down to 86. And Vermont. Once you hit south, south, central, south L.A., there are no scooters for over a ten mile radius. You can look at the map and it shows you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And it's amazing that even with that specs, which you said is a 62 or 68%, that they're failing. So clearly we need to make we need to be more stringent and, you know, we need to penalize them for not making this accessible to low income users.'",

Limit repetition of praise and agreement between council members.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Stephanie. So I will walk through a little bit of the recommendations that we came up with. But before I start, I just would like to say that we were really looking for a direction tonight. We came up with some ideas and concepts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These are really your rules. So as a body you really need to decide what you're comfortable with doing what you would like to change. There may be other things that you're interested in, or some of these that you believe are inappropriate and just want to say these are ideas for debate and discussion.'",

Any questions that we can help answer before the meeting? And we always are willing and able to do that to help you make an informed decision when you get to the council'",
        "'speaker_10': 'floor. Second, we'd like to suggest that we set schedule time and time limits for ceremonies and presentations. We often have the public come and that means a whole lot to them to come and be able to present to you or be honored by you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so having a set time to conduct those presentations would provide some structure. And we we recommend setting a limit of about 5 minutes per presentation so that we normally have about two or three of those. And it would really be a structured part of our agenda.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we'd like to the city clerk to help keep us all on schedule by creating a timer for presentations to keep that on track. We also recommend that when we do get those meetings where we get lots of speakers on an individual item, that we basically continue the practice that you've put in place over the last year'",
        "'speaker_10': ', which we think is working very well. Essentially, we would codify that when there is more than ten speakers identified for a specific issue, that the allocated time drops down to 90 seconds for everybody. We would then formalize this practice in the code.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But of course, with exemptions for language access and ADA exceptions. We continue to encourage use of the consent calendar. If you've noticed, over the last year we have been putting more items on the consent calendar and I think that's been going pretty smoothly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We'd even look to do more as it makes sense. And those would be things like grant applications, contracts, receiving file items. And of course at any time if you think that needs to be on the regular agenda, any council member can pull those for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Number five for content calendar. We'd really like to get those done before 630 as a matter of practice. Those are fairly routine items. I'd also like to say that often those are the items that we have some of the junior staff here who are there to answer questions and a lot of them are on overtime.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we'd like to have them if they need to be. Give you some information. Do that by 630. You can this item, you would still be able to do consent any time you'd want to if you needed a push it back.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But we would just release the staff after 630 and then any items that we couldn't answer, we would just hold those over to the next council meeting. Number six. Where possible, we'd suggest keeping to the posted agenda order.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But we know that that a lot of times you'll have different groups come up and that we do need to be flexible. So we're not saying not to be flexible, but where we can try to create some predictability.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And part of that pairs with the idea of times certain. So where we know we're going to have big groups try to set a time certain so that that group can prepare and the groups before them know to be able to get there either before or after for their item.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Number seven, we are suggesting kind of helping the council keep track of the discussion and creating 30 minute timer after city council or after the the public have spoken that we just create a timer for ourselves. And then at 30 minutes, basically the clerk would remind us and say to the council, would you like us to continue'",
        "'speaker_10': 'debate? Would you like to vote or would you like to table this and move on so you could continue debate and continue debate. But I think this would help us create some sense of, you know, that we've discussed for 30 minutes and let you come to a decision point on that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Number eight, we have a number of city council committees. When we do have items that are really lengthy, we expect lots of debate. We would encourage sending those items to committee. They can be heard in committee and we can get a lot of that debate at a committee level.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sometimes those meetings are even at times where the public can attend. That's not a normal Tuesday night. And then when it would come back, if we already had that opportunity for a lot of debate, we would be looking at a lower amount of debate level.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So maybe a minute if it had already been hurting committee and is just being reheard at the council level for item nine. I want to take it back to the supplemental agenda and when it was created, this council created the supplemental agenda and it was designed to really handle those issues that were time sensitive and couldn't get'",
        "'speaker_10': 'on the regular agenda. So it was designed for really the emergency items are the ones that couldn't be done by that in that for eight days, which is what we try to do for all of our regular agenda items.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Over time, we've seen more use of the supplemental for routine items and regular items, and that provides less time for you as the council and also staff and the community to kind of ask questions and debate. So we encourage kind of getting back to what the supplemental was originally designed for.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And by doing that, you would add a statement of urgency on your council letters. Just to clarify, this is urgent because so if I'm putting it on the supplemental, I have to because of the following reason. Number ten.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sometimes our close sessions tend to go over. I think this council tries really hard to have them done by 5:00. But if they do need to go longer than that, we do have the option of continuing those to the end of the meeting or continuing it to another another day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So those are a short term recommendations. We do have a couple ones for future implementation that we'd like to let you know about. One is to hold a Robert's Rules of Order refresher. But there are also some additional council rules out there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's Rosenberg's thank you. Rosenberg's rules that some of the cities are looking at. There are Roberts rules just a little simpler. We'd also like to really look at some use of technology in the new civic center. For example, some agencies, especially Metro, have sign up devices that you can sign up either on your personal device or at'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a kiosk, or you bring it down to the city clerk and you say, I'd like to speak on these items. That allows the chair to actually have a list of people who want to be able to speak. And then you would be able to do that at any time until it's time that the item is heard and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'then it's cut off so that there's a sense of how many speakers that we have. So we're exploring that technology. We can do a little bit of that with our Granicus system, but it would probably mean creating a new system as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we're looking at the metro system. We also, just as a fun idea, thought, you know, a lot of our a lot of you want to make sure that you're talking to the people that show up and letting them know that you support them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There may be other ways to do that through emojis or other kind of fun ways to let them know that you're supportive of what the speaker is saying. So we we can look at that. And finally, electronic board to announce the council meeting agenda order.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So when we do need to move it around that we can electronically let the council know that. So I'm at the end of the presentation. I do want to point out a couple of areas that we looked at, but we aren't recommending.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One was shortening public comment. We actually tried that as a council back in the nineties and that wasn't very well supported. You could also move public comment all the way to the end of the meeting. You know, that is an option.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, it doesn't normally take that much time. So we're not recommending that you could add additional meetings. We heard that in the community outreach we actually found in the city of Austin that it didn't result. They tried that, they added it, and it actually resulted in more meetings and more discussion because there was just more time'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to have all that debate. So that actually didn't shorten meetings. Timing. Councilmember Comments. A number of cities have tried this and none of them actually found that they enforce those rules. We really didn't feel that, you know, that that would stifle debate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we didn't feel that that was something to recommend and then stopping it at that time. Long Beach also tried that to set a curfew and that, you know, didn't really help move the meeting along either. So with that, we tried to keep our presentation presentation brief and we're ready to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much. Let's start with conservatorship or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm anxious to hear my colleague's comments. Just one point there on on Robert's rules and maybe the city attorney would like to weigh in on this. And we are required to follow Roberts rules. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under our ordinance, we have adopted the council has adopted Roberts rules unless they conflict with the Brown Act. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So it's a matter of how closely we adhere to those rules. I believe this is the point in the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So I guess part of this motion would be to, you know, adhere strictly to Roberts rules in our meetings. The second was on the. Well, not in order of priority, but. The the thing that wasn't added to the city of Austin trying additional meetings, I think I said in October, that's counterintuitive to what we're trying to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'achieve here. You give us more time than we're not streamlining our meetings. But beyond that, what wasn't mentioned is cost. And that would be a significant cost to the city, I assume, to add another meeting per month.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We would expect each meeting. We have security costs. We have a cost for all the staff to be here where I'm doing free parking, all those things. So yes, we would expect each meeting there would be a cost probably in a couple thousand dollars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. Well, I promised my comments would be brief, so I'm going to defer to my colleagues now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I if I had an emoji, I would give a thumbs up to the staff's report. I think it was very thorough. The outreach and survey results are here and very, very telling. I support, I think, most of what has been recommended by staff to help streamline our meetings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I want to thank councilmember member Supernova and my colleagues for bringing this issue forward. Obviously, we are here to do the people's business and oftentimes our city council meetings, I would say, devolve into theater and presentations in front of the council as opposed to public comment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But also what I'm seeing here from the the survey results is that our residents believe that the city council should be talking less. And so whether or not we put this in a policy, I think we need to govern ourselves accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm going to hurry up and get get through this. And with respect to transparency, I think obviously this is the place of the people's business. And so we should be as transparent as possible. I'm definitely always interested in hearing public comment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I learn something new every time we go through that. But limiting the time is, I think, makes a lot of sense and is consistent with what many other public agencies do. I think we're very generous here as a city council and compared to other other public agencies, other city councils, the county and others.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so thank you again for bringing this forward. And I look forward to supporting it and hopefully having more efficient meetings in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello and thank you for this item, Darrell. I support staff's recommendations. There's a couple of comments that I do need to make. I appreciate that for number three, you've kind of laid out for us today of a formal way that that would be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to make sure that it wasn't done on an ad hoc basis and that there was a standard in place for reducing the time the council committee items is. I think it is something I support, but I want to recognize that it's a challenge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so as much as we can try to schedule those so that we have full committees and we have full conversation and that it's not a 20 minute presentation and doesn't allow for community members to engage is really important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think one of the things that was brought up by some of the committee members I met with was full time council and recognizing that cities that have committees where they do a lot of work in committees are full time council and that it is challenging to have real debate all night long till 1:00 in the morning'",
        "'speaker_0': 'without having a full council in a city that's trying to tackle some big issues. So I wanted to just say that publicly that doing the work in committees can be challenging. The other parts that I'd like to just comment, you know, for the presentations and for the hearings, I'm fully supportive of having those at 3:00 instead of'",
        "'speaker_0': '5:00, having them before a full council meeting start. So I'd be curious to hear from others, mayor council on what their, their thoughts are. But as much as we can here earlier, recognizing that we have working families that need to come at five, but if it's a presentation or we're giving a certification that those things can happen'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with with people that that need to show up for those specifically and absolutely in the staff reports in the council agenda, I've seen other city council agendas that do include staff reports in full or in those binders so that we're not looking and receiving the information for the first time or the Monday before so that we can'",
        "'speaker_0': 'really digest it. I think that that for me is the most important part too, is that the comments I think that was made around limiting the discussion and questions with staff on the floor. It might look like theater, but it's part of making sure that everybody that can go back, look at the videos, know that we've asked'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the questions, it's memorialized and that they have the answers to that. So I don't have a change on the motion, really, just making sure that that we have an ordinance that doesn't limit council engagement. I don't believe there's a price you can put on community engagement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're here to govern for everyone. And so making sure that it's accessible and I'm hearing councilmember supervisors comments, there has been some conversation out there that this is about limiting public engagement and it's about making sure that public engagement is accessible and real for every single person in our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I really do appreciate this item on the floor tonight and I look forward to hearing my council colleagues comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to start with a compliment. I know that we talked about. Over complement each other. One of the things that I often hear from my colleagues I'm sorry. From my community and. I agree as well as many of us have really successful newsletters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know, Jeanine, you're a Councilwoman Price or Pierce your newsletters well-written and I try to memorialize my comments through the newsletter instead of having to do it at the dais, because there aren't as many community members who want to spend the time fast forwarding and rewinding, but hopefully through some of the recommendations I'm making, it'll be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'easier for them. So having reviewed a lot of agendas and dealing with long meetings over the years, I'd strongly suggest the following. Friendlies Council consider that the order of agenda items are based on the attendees present with big agenda items given a time certain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if we have 100 people here to speak on one item, that item shouldn't wait until 10:00 at night. Those 100 people who are here should be at the front of the of the agenda. And I think that the mayor's done that pretty effectively, but it hasn't been required.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that if it was required, it would give the public some knowledge and understanding. I recognize that there'll be additional resources available at the new City Hall at whether it's Metro or Coastal Commission or County Board of Supervisors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can register that you want to make a public comment so that the staff know how many are coming in advance. But I don't think you should have to drive down to City Hall to register. So if it was possible to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Register for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Public comment when the agenda comes out stating that you plan to be there, I think that would be helpful so that we'd be able to get that picture further in advance. I don't know how you work that out, though, because oftentimes people then no show and so that gives a false number.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't want to people to game the system, so I don't know what that looks like, but I'll pass that to staff. But I would like to formalize that in the new city hall. Since we have a system for queuing that day, maybe that day you come and you click.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm registered here. I attended that. The items with the most attendees or the groups of attendees should be at the front end of the meeting. I would like to have council consider moving any discussion of non agenda items to the end of the meeting and here's why.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The first priority of the council at a regularly scheduled meeting to be do is to be doing and discussing the business of those things that are on the agenda. And we should give priority to the people who came and waited and want to speak on items that are advertised to be discussed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because we aren't able to take action on non agenda items anyway. And so for that that would be my an additional friendly. Public participation on general matters, not agendas, are important, and we need to be able to have those opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'While many council members have a lot of community forums, not everyone from every other district goes to each other's community meetings. And I can understand why this forum is appropriate. But I also don't think that if there's a ton of people here on agenda items, that they should have to wait.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've had many business owners and community members wait until ten, 11:00 at night to make a comment on an agenda item that they were planning on, on commenting. So I think that those are important specifically to council. I am sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Staff Recommendation number seven. I would be in favor. I appreciate the point of order at 30 minutes. I would be interested in having a count up clock on these screens for us to see what that looks like. I would also be okay with every council member having the unlimited amount of times to queue, but for them to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'only speak in five minute increments. And so I think that that helps because if you're going to have a 30 minute clock. What I would be concerned about is a filibuster of one council member, not necessarily intentionally, but that they have 30 minutes of things to say and the other eight council members don't have that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would recommend a count up clock with five minute limits and then you can recue and get back in line with with no penalty. I would also feel strongly that the number of signatures required to be placed on a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A supplemental agenda. If you would like to be a supplemental agenda and you feel it is an urgent item, I think you need to get 200 signatures because there are way too many items have been active. So it is actually not against the Brown Act.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not saying you'd be signed onto the item. I'm just saying that you would sign to open the discussion. Is there any way that that's possible?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. That's okay. Well. Would it be possible to take a vote at the beginning of the meeting of whether or not all agenda supplemental items are able to be tabled to the next week?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You could take an action that night once the agenda has been published, you could take an action to table or continue and item anything. Rolonda. Yes, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will put that in my personally. But just one thing for us to think about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Over here taking notes, I'm not sure I'm going to be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Writing at the end for an acceptance of my friendly. Yep. Okay. First friendly council member. Super. Now would you be open to formalizing that agenda? Items with the most speakers would be moved to the front of the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, okay. It. Since we're into Robert's rules, does the chair recognize me to speak?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Council member. All right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you be open to my friendly that there's a 30 minute count up clock of point of order with a five minute friendly for each councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. I would like to ask staff if if that's something that's feasible. I think it sounds like a great idea, but.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we could do a count up clock. We could do count up or count down. I'd actually need to ask the clerk about, you know, whether you know what that would mean to track each council member and whether we could do a sub clock of 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if the friendly is. Let's explore this. I'm on board with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful. And then and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just if I can get some clarification, what happens at 5 minutes is the chair is supposed to then cut the council member off and move to the next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One. I'm happy to time it myself.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay, so 5.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Minutes at.'",
        "'speaker_6': '5 minutes, the next person cued up would go and the person that spoke the first 5 minutes is welcome to cue back up. But other people get to go first.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Understood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful and then giving first priority to agenda items and second priority to people who want to speak on items that are not agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if I could ask for clarification on that, is are you we're discussing public comment here on non agenda items. So you're you're recommending that the public comment on non agenda items is moved to the end of the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I actually would say that, yes, I feel that the number of people who come here to speak on agenda items, or at least if we have a system that shows cueing, that if there are a number of agenda items that have no one here to speak, then of course speaking on non agenda, these items could come.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if I understand correctly, currently we have kind of a hybrid where we allow the first ten members who sign up and then our second public comment period is really a continuation of the first one. We just allow ten at the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if I understand your motion, an amendment would be to move all public comment to the end of the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll wait on that one, but I would just like to hear my counsel colleagues ideas related to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hard for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Me. I'm not sure we can wait. If you're making a friendly, it's either making the point or withdrawing discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not going to make that piece of friendly. I'm just open to hearing my colleagues here. It's hard for me to see many members of our community here to speak on a specific item and have to wait for non agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So just something to think about. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Vice Miranda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, yes. Thank you very much. First of all, I want to thank Coach and Superman for bringing this. I just want to say that. That the intent on this item is very thoughtful and that I do appreciate all our public speakers and that's what it's all about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think certainly it's about the public. It's not about we want to do it dices because we say what we have to say and I think we should get it over with. But it's all about the public. This is why you had us, you know, to be your, you know, our individual that you chose to be your'",
        "'speaker_2': 'your your our council person. But what I'm saying is that I like to listen to the public more than like to listen to ourselves because you make a lot more sense than we do. That's the way I look at it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to thank you guys for your engagement and your involvement. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor. Councilman Richardson, I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So there's a lot that I first of all, I want to recognize staff. They got their staff report in in 10 minutes. Good job, staff. That was a lot of slides and got it done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I recognize that few a few thoughts, a few notes. So one, I'm not sure that our compliments are really that big of a time. Drainer saying saying nice things to each other goes a long way. I remember some councils when they had very few nice things to say and I know sometimes we get reprimanded for being'",
        "'speaker_7': 'positive sometimes, but I think I just want to say I don't think it's that big a deal to give someone a compliment. It's not gonna take that much time. Secondly, on the on, I support all of the recommendations that are listed and I want to raise up one issue about the committee meeting times.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I feel that the committee meet when we start committee meetings on Council Day, you can't get through a lot of work, especially when they're big committees, economic development, budget oversight. These are these are committees with a lot of conversation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I think we need to we need to implement a time certain to end those. When you use your bucket of time, your 30 minutes or whatever it is, your committee meeting, you can't take any more items.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is there is there a way to do that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. PARKIN Yes. The committees could decide that on their own, or we can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We as a council set that as a policy for the committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You could set that as a policy for your city, for the council. Committee for committees. Yes, you could add that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd like to I'd like to add that as a friendly. Councilman Huebner So can you restate so this is if there's a committee meeting taking place prior to council, you cannot go beyond the time that you are budgeted like you were scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I enthusiastically okay. I think that helps. And then in addition to that, I think that the council committees in almost every city in most cases should meet on days other than council Tuesday, and that should be lifted up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know that we can that we should make that the law, but we should like we should use other days and evenings to come in and do council committee meetings. And I know because that's the real opportunity to get people to come give public input if it's a canned one hour before the council meeting, I don't'",
        "'speaker_7': 'think that that's realistic and people aren't off work then. So we need to think about taking at least setting one additional evening per month where we just do, you know, council committee meetings, something like that. So when you think about that, is there something we can sort of work with on that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How can we hold people to that or encourage that if that's on the clerk can do when we schedule them?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think really that's up to the nine of you and what time you have available. So right now we really know that you're you've got other responsibilities. So we try to put things on Tuesdays, but the chair of the committee can call that time for whenever they want to do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It in the way I see it with the structure of our council, if we have, you know, you know, folks work and all that, I think it's not too much to ask for one additional evening. Like doesn't have to be a Tuesday to try to get your committee work done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the next thing I would say is I love the friendly amendment that Councilman Mongeau put forward about sort of we're moving up the folks who brought out a bunch of people because I think it rewards civic engagement and it rewards organizing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's been a lot of times when we've had a bunch of people from North Long Beach, but their item, their issue just wasn't as hot as some other item with fewer people, and they've had to wait til ten, 11:00 at night because their issue wasn't really that sexy citywide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. But they turned out and they did it and they deserve to be be brought up sooner. So I support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That. If I could ask for clarification on that is that if we're trying to write that into the ordinance, it's going to be more than 75 people. It's more than 25 people is more than 50. I, I just want to stress.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it's the discretion of the chair, but there has to be a mechanism. We're going to have to figure out what that mechanism that I don't think 75 is the number.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't know what I'm asking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it's like a show of hands, right? If there's 30, 40 people in there at the end of the meeting, they raise their hand. That's something the chair has got to recognize.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it'll be we'll write it as the discretion of the chair. If there's a crowd, the he or she, whoever the chair is, can call that item up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's the current policy we have right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't know. That's what I'm asking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We need we need it to be codified somehow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, you need to give me. I need to have some way to codify it in that we can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's what? I said we keep going. I think I know where committee member and Councilman Mongo trying to get to. So let's clarify that in a minute here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And then the last thing I would say is, you know, I think two or three of us probably might be some offenders on being a little long winded. You know, it's okay. I get it. Recognize that might be one of those offenders.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'll say I think the five minute clock could work. I think in cases where it won't work and we just need to call it out, is when the maker of the motion is making a presentation. And I don't think they should be making 30 minute presentations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But in all honesty, if you put something together, we can say if you're the maker of the motion, you have 10 minutes. But every comment beyond there's five. And if you want to queue up after your ten, but you've got ten to get your presentation, I think that's really reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So would you accept that, Councilman? Super now. I'm seeing some nodding heads. Well, I'm a little unclear on this when that starts happening. This term not accusing you of gaming the system. At a certain point, we're going to look at who who's conducting the presentations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I didn't want to go there tonight and have a count on, gee, which council office is doing the most presentations and whatnot. So that's a little bit of my concern there, if that makes sense to you. Well, this has nothing to do with tracking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we should be, frankly, tracking how much time council members are taking. That's not one of the friendlies right now. Okay. The friendly right now is simply I'm concurring on the five minute clock and I'm saying the maker of the motion, I think is a bit different if you are sort of making the motion and you're'",
        "'speaker_7': 'making a presentation. Staff got a really efficient presentation done in 10 minutes. I think council members and the public, I think really realistically, if you come with a motion in 5 minutes and the mayor says it, that's 5 minutes, it's going to happen a lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I think having a reasonable cap and saying ten is fair.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If I can add a suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. And I, I understand where Councilor is going to go to the city attorney really quick. I saw people, people queued up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For clarification on the maker of the motion. I think if I hear it right, it's if that's their item, they're bringing their item and they're introducing that. I am not. Hey, I signed up as the maker of the motion for this item, so I get 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, no, that's. You're right. If you're present, like you prepared this item.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the intent of the item here was that the speaker, whoever it is, whether it's the council member or the staff, the 30 minute clock happens for debate. So that wouldn't apply to that. You know, the council member presenting or staff presenting it wouldn't apply to the public.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's when we say, okay, we'd like to have councilmember debate. That's when the 30 minutes would, sir.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's right. And so I think that clarifies the point. And so the 30 minute clock is on debate. And so if you're presenting the motion, the clock's not on during the understanding. Okay. All right. Got a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Five minute clock.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As well. There is no five minute clock if you're presenting a motion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is not part of the debate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for clarifying.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's helpful. Councilman Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What's nine times five? 45, 45, nine council members hear 5 minutes each as 45 minutes and then the mayor always has to put in his is just 5 minutes. So you're talking 50 minutes, a five minute thing or 3 minutes?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I love it. Just like the crowd. Just like everybody else. Just like everybody else. And without. Without rescuing. Because you're going to go into another person's time again. I don't know. But I'd like to refute the fact most council meetings when we like going to midnight is because we're having a healthy or a robust debate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's point, counterpoint, recue, kind of the point substitute, substitute and substitute a substitute that takes long. I mean, there have been council meetings that I've been here. In fact, it was more so in the beginning because we had a lot of inexperienced rookies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sophomores who didn't really or were not really aware or trained in Robert's Rules of Order. And I really, totally agree with the Robert whose order I saw some comments that saying it would be a waste of time. It is not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We need it because there's a lot of people who haven't gotten formally through it that works with it or within it, but not fully trained in how it works. I'm saying that because it's I've had 20 going on 20 years of this, but the bottom line is that if you want to make council meetings efficient and streamlined'",
        "'speaker_11': ', it's something that we have to monitor ourselves and, you know, and and when we get into a debate or we get into a a robust discussion or whatever it is that we want to make a point, you know, there's got to be a time where we have to agree to disagree and move on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if it's such that we can't come to a consensus, then let's table it for the next for the next meeting. If it's not time sensitive, that is I mean, I know sometimes we have time sensitive issues that we have to absolutely deal with that now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But if it's not time sensitive, then we will move on. As many of you know, I also belong to a coastal commission and how we handle those meetings basically is that it's a time set for public comment. And I'm not I'm not in agreement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're moving from the comment to the end of the meetings because some people are here precisely for that. They want to come to make a public comment in the beginning of a meeting, put in their their comments, put it on the record and then leave.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And for a lot of individuals who are here, even for controversial items that we have to have a lot of interest, we could probably move that up also to to get them to have their say and then they could move on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So, I mean, there's a different there are various ways, obviously, of of using time more efficiently. And another recommendation this would be more accurate to the public than to us. If there is a item out there that is highly controversial and there's going to be more than ten people would say 15 to 20 people with 3 minutes'",
        "'speaker_11': 'each and then going out to one or two, they could, you know, do a group presentation themselves, you know, like like consolidate themselves to say that, you know, if, if we are part of a of a I see, I see.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know. Kilkenny as an example, there's five of you here, you know, you want to make one presentation for maybe 4 minutes, that's it. And not each for again need to speak for 12 minutes. You could have one presentation for four just as an example.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The, the other parts, you know, and there's, there's going to be a lot of other controversies. I mean, we deal with controversies every, every, every minute, every, every council meeting. So that's going to that that city that I know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm getting the word over here from American media that I don't I think I read about 5 minutes. I think a right. About 5 minutes. If you would interrupt me, I'll finish up. But but the bottom line is, is that there's other ways of measuring and counting our time, but we have to self monitor ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's making council member Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you, Councilmember. Super not for bringing this forward. This is a great item. I'm an agreement with one through seven on the city staff suggestions, but I will emphasize a few of them and get through it really quickly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of course, one thing I'll add is absolutely, I think we need a better guidance and proper use of consent versus supplemental versus regular agenda and committee meetings to so that we're not, you know, crowding the regular agenda with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Things that could be added to the consent calendar. And I think we just, you know, need to be maybe told a little bit more directly that that could be a potential versus adding more and more to the agenda number to the public comment side, I would be in preference of keeping it in the beginning just because there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are people that, you know, want to get through public comment first and not hear all of the back and forth through council comment. And given that we're talking about potentially 45 minutes plus, I mean, I think public comment deserves to be first and we keep consistent and ensuring that and what I'll say to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Believe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were going back and forth about like what would the limit be for people in the audience? And I think we could possibly keep it consistent, keep it consistent with what we've said here in the city. Staff report that after ten people we reduce down to 90 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that could be where we move it up in the agenda as well. That could be a potential and. I'm also in favor of closed session at end of meeting. Sometimes it's hard as working full time as well to get to closed session at 330 or 4:00.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know city attorneys like, no, don't do that to me, but I'm sorry. Sometimes it's it's really difficult having another job and having to come in and kind of rushing to closed session. That's just the fact of the matter with many of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then lastly, I will emphasize that the city staff presentations, a lot of times I know that I'm caught in speaking, you know, on some issues on the dais and asking more of the technical questions. Because I haven't seen the city staff report and I haven't seen it until I sit down in the dais at 5:00 and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have to kind of thumb through it beforehand. So it would be really great to have that. And I know a few colleagues have mentioned the same 1 to 2 weeks in advance, if possible. So we can have some time to review and digest and we can come a little bit more prepared to council meetings with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'information. That would be helpful. And I know we have staffs here, too, but you know, again, many of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Other jobs and it's a little difficult. And I'm also of the same mindset as Councilmember Muranga on the 3 minutes. I'm totally great with that. If we want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To go along.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That I think the public has 3 minutes. I think we can also, you know, work with 3 minutes as well. So that's what I will say. But I want to thank Councilmembers Hooper now again and city staff for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I actually wasn't going to queue up on this topic because I like all the suggestions. But I will say that sometimes the process of debate takes a long time and a lot of times we're asking questions of staff and I want staff to give detailed responses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if my clock is going for 5 minutes and staff takes 3 minutes answering a question which I want them to answer, then it limits my ability to talk. And I'll tell you, I mean, this is great. These are all great guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I was elected to be an advocate on behalf of my residents, and I'm going to advocate in the way that works for me. And I'm going to take the amount of time that I need to advocate for my residents so we can set these as guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I am I'm not going to be limited from queuing up again. I'm not going to be limited from asking questions. I'm not going to be limited from being heard. I'm not going to be limited from asking questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have a right to be heard and advocate so we can set the standards as guidelines. But there's just no way that, you know, we always talk about language access and making sure that everyone feels included and all this stuff, you know, it might take people a little bit longer to articulate what they need to say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It may take people the opportunity to hear from all of their colleagues before they might change their mind. They might hear something they like a colleague say and say, you know what that makes? That's a really great point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not about rushing through. I understand the intent of this, and I think it's great, but. I'm going to advocate and I'm going to represent the way that I know how in my time frame. That's the bottom line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if the chair wants to hold me in contempt, the chair can do that. But I'm going to advocate for my residence. So I think these are all great guidelines. I think we can definitely stick to try to stick to the 5 minutes and really try to respect that spirit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it was Councilman Richardson that said, you know, we monitor each other in the spirit of what we're trying to do, but there's no way in hell anyone's going to limit what I have to say and how I have to say it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you. Let's go to the public comment and they're going to come back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Larry Goodhew What I'm adamant about is returning to work to what worked so well for so long in terms of public comment, i.e. after the opening Pledge of Allegiance and any special recognition of various different paradigms and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first ten people that signed up to speak will speak. And that has always been the process until we had our criminally complicit mayor come in and jerk the council speaker list and the council items around like Seinfeld's Kramer enters and leaves room period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Stick to work what works so well for so long. Then you'll have the you'll have the backing of the community. Once you start doing what the mayor is doing. You lose the support of the public. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Karen replied. As someone who regularly comes to the council meetings, I was pleased to see that a lot of my suggestions were adopted. I was one of those that wanted to limit the council member time because it's obvious when you haven't had time to read about the issues that you're kind of just talking, and that's not a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'productive use of time. So that's my comment on that. The awardees, you know, I come and I see the same awardees year after year after year. I don't think that's necessary. I think there should be a limit to the number of times when the awardees come forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All the nonprofits want to be honored. All the nonprofits in our community do valuable work. So it's really painful to see somebody come up here five years in a row and be recognized that many times when other organizations are excluded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that would be a suggestion for that. One of the few issues that I agree with, Larry Good Yuan, is that the ten people should be able to speak at the front of the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't want those ten people to all be for the same organization presenting the same position. A lot of times that blocks some of us that come and can't get here early enough from being allowed to speak in those comments on the non agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sometimes we have important things to say that are time sensitive and that blocks that out. So I'd like you to think about that. And then the other suggestion is, you know, I handled the legislation for the Gray Panthers and I utilized the register.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have a system where you can sign up to be notified when legislation is coming forward that you have an interest in. I'd like to suggest that the city look at doing something like that. So I was watching a public safety committee online yesterday and I would have liked to have been at that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They were talking about the group grant. I was one of the original four matters of the group grant. I would have liked to have been at that meeting. I didn't know that that meeting was happening. So my other pieces, we need a full time city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You guys do amazing work for part time staff and I know you probably all put full time in. I think we need to recognize that as a community and work to making that happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And our last comment.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To make sure it wasn't like 15 people bothering me. I agree with Karen there. Um, you know, some of us, me personally, I work 60 hours a week, so it's kind of hard for me to get here at 2:03 p.m. and sign up with 1015 of my friends that we're all going to talk about the same exact'",
        "'speaker_12': 'thing. You know, I think that's just like a clear abuse of the system. Um, I agree with Councilman Mongo in relation to you said something about figuring out some kind of app or a way to register our comments beforehand so that you can see the queue and judge in amount of how many people are queued up to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'move agenda item up or down and due to how many people are outside waiting for it. Personally, I would say that it would be great. You know, I know there was a lady the other day, she was complaining about some million TV or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Maybe you'll be great whenever that TV screen comes, you know, as soon as it goes, you know, over the time limit, it just sounds like like a nuclear bomb. Like this starts blinking. And then you can just cause I see, you know, the the mayor and the vice mayor, you know, these some of these people, you know'",
        "'speaker_12': ', they don't got a lot going on in their lives. So it means a lot to just be like yelling at you guys for whatever the 90 seconds or whatever. So it's like, maybe you can just shut off the mic.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You don't even have to say, excuse me or whatever you can. Maybe you can queue up, Madam Clerk, you can just like shut off the mic and time's done. You got to get out of here because it's just it's it's crazy.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In relation to maybe the awards. Yeah, maybe. You know I know it's good to see the children with the, the Boy Scouts and a lot of these non-profits. I'm not technically opposed to it. I do think if we're going to be trying to figure out a way to be timely, maybe maybe on another day from 35 minutes'",
        "'speaker_12': ', 45 minutes, you can just knock all them out. And, you know, you can open up the time for more, you know, retirees and come out here and be young. And but in the meantime, the friendlies, if I see people, you know, you know, that's us over here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'As far as you guys. Yeah, some of these friendlies, it's crazy. Like, it's like nine friendlies that are friendly, that are removed. The friendly. So I hear, councilman, you're wrong. It's like, you know, and not to minimize, of course, public discourse as important as our representatives to, you know, use you are representing us.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But sometimes I'm like, I mean, where are we even? I like the semantics of where these things are. Sometimes I'm looking at the city attorney and like, do you know where where the position is or the friendly is at this moment?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I'm looking at him. He's confused. He's looking at his notes, too. So, you know, we can just figure out a way to streamline. I'm with you, Mr. Supernormal. Time is of the essence, and time is important. And I would like to be leaving here at maybe like 8:09 p.m. instead of, you know, these midnight hour.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it's like this are. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That closes public comment. Let me go back to the council. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I'll be quick. Just two things I want to clarify with our city attorney. So, number one, we have the process of let's say that an item here warrants more debate or whatever. We could suspend rules or move to extend debate on all those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That council has the ability to do that, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. Under the current municipal code. And we would imagine doing it similar in a in a revision to the municipal code. The first section reads The Order of Businesses City Council. It all regular meeting shall be as follows unless otherwise waived by the consent of the Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with the consent of the Council, you could waive your rules.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay? And I think that's important to say. We can, you know, we can go along with these guidelines, but if we're going to break them, we should just try to get consensus or approval from the council to do it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think if it's an important issue, council will approve that. And then secondly, in terms of committee work, just one thing I want to clarify I think is a bit redundant when you know sometimes it's okay, but sometimes redundant if an agenda item starts, that council gets referred to, a committee committee does work, refer back to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'council and and the distinction between our commissions and our committees. I understand work can originate at the committee level. It ultimately has to come to council, but it doesn't have to initiate at council and go back to a committee and back to council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's been some, you know, some questions about whether you know about that process. But it happens all the time. The B or C has originated work has ultimately made it. The Council Economic Development Committee is rejected works ultimately ultimately, you know, made it to council and it cuts out council time having to come back for those'",
        "'speaker_7': 'two bites of the hat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And council member. I agree, but it's not a very clear bright line in the origination of the work because if if you have a chair that starts directing staff and starts accumulating and using a bunch of staff resources in time or in the city manager's opinion is excessive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then that work would have to go to council and have it be referred back to the committee in order to do that work. But but generally speaking, on small items. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So and that makes sense to me. What I mean is the ability for a council, for a committee to refer work to council committees, have that ability to refer something. The Council doesn't have to direct staff to build something or do a lot of staff time, but simply referring work, the council committee can do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. That's wonderful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And actually, Councilman Longo is actually cued up first and we did public comment and didn't go back to her. So, Councilman Mongo, I think Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Perfect. I just want to appreciate one of the comments that came forward about legislation you're interested in. One of the items that I brought forward was about how to better. Pull in community input. And I would love for members of the public to be able to register in our new system that says, I'm interested in anything related'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to the elderly or housing or whatever it is to notify them of those key words in an agenda item. I think that that's a really important second. I am completely supportive of the recue idea. I think that I want to support a lot of the things Councilman Price said in that we each have different ways to advocate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for our residents. I've actually even heard through the grapevine that she's defended the way that I advocate for my residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also recognize that sometimes each of us spend a lot of time writing up a list of questions. And I know I've done this before where I will go through all my questions and then. Sitting next to me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Daryl's like crossing off the same questions. And so I think that we can gain some variance in the way the questions are asked if we go through a campaign process. And I also believe that the count up timer is just a guide, not necessarily a hard and fast.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I appreciate the comments Councilman Richardson made on that as well as for the other days of the week and meetings. I can't speak for other residents, but it is a trek for my community to get downtown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a trek. And so if there is an agenda item on the city council meeting that they might be interested in. That's one of the values of having the Budget Oversight Committee meeting right before so they can kind of speak to both components of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm open to exploring other days of the weeks and meetings, but I also recognize that that can be a challenge. And I often, instead of having committee committee meetings, I try to just do community outreach meetings in the neighborhoods that are impacted and then gather that information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But one of the components of that is that the EA comment, the number of characters allowed is very limiting. So I don't know if there'd be a friendly to explore both the number of characters allowed and what an appropriate number would be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And second, the community comment period is too short. People want to spend time writing them out. And I know that the city the city clerk has made some exceptions on big agenda items. But I would love for even when the agenda item isn't posted, they're often people who have very distinct comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what they do is they then email all of our council offices, see all of us, and I think that it would be much better for it to go to the city clerk and have a place that we can all log into and check that the public can also check, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that transparency is really important. So if you'd be open to having the city clerk look into that, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Um, okay, so we just talked about staff time, so we have different entities who've weighed in on this. So I guess we have to ask the city clerk individually if that's something feasible that she can look into. Okay, then we'll accept that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I have a question for the city clerk regarding this. If this is voted on and approved this evening, this will go to you to create an ordinance. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in terms of it being an ordinance with the the I keep hearing guidelines, but I don't feel like they're guidelines if it's an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. That's correct. This would be come the new order and proceedings for the council meeting. So I'm not going to ask again on some of the clarifications on the 5 minutes and the 30 minutes. Are we putting those in there?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I've heard they would be guidelines. They would be a recue for the 5 minutes, but there's unlimited recues or so that would then become part of your rule unless you vote to suspend that for a particular item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I do appreciate Councilmember Price's comments and all of our my colleagues comments regarding this. I know that we all endeavor to to to have more efficient meetings and and council members who bring our brought this forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I seconded the motion this evening. But I'm I'm a little concerned that we may be over restricting ourselves if we put this in an ordinance. And so I would just ask if, Councilmember Suber now, would you be friendly, open to a friendly to to create created council policy that that that does all that we've discussed here this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'evening as opposed to an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, if I understand what we have in place right now, Mr. Parkin, just an example. We have a moment of silence. It wouldn't make sense to eliminate that. We wouldn't gain a lot. But by ordinance, we're required to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would that be correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You currently are required to do it unless waived by consent of the Council. So right now all of these are how the meeting your rules that the Council has approved to how you're going to conduct your meeting so that the public has an understanding of what we're going to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we do the moment of silence. We do the Pledge of Allegiance, we're hearings, public comment, etc. All of those can be changed by a vote of the Council or consent to the Council being moved around. But this lays out the framework for how you're going to conduct your meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if we're directed to make these changes in the staff report, we would come back and come back and bring an amended ordinance to you with the revised rules. And the first sentence will say, you can waive these if you with consent of the Council, and if you like them, we will adopt it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If not, you can send us back and tell us what to change.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, so that that was my point. That was my starting point, if you don't mind me saying our city attorney suggested I start there. And just as that is a guideline, we're working with a current ordinance. So my proposal was let's bring forward a new ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think some of these things are still a little bit fuzzy. We need to sort them out tonight. But at the end of the day, you're coming back with an ordinance that we still have a second shot at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A second and third shot. Right. We would bring back for first reading. And if you make changes, we'll bring it back again. And until you're satisfied with.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And our understanding from the council direction tonight is that you'd like this to be flexible. So, you know, we would create that 30 minute time period, but then you have as a body the ability to decide what you want to do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Those 5 minutes would be there, but then, you know, it all is within the 30 minutes where then we would get direction from you. Do you want to continue debate or you as a body want to stop debate?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we think we'll bring back something that has a lot of flexibility for you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. And then just just to well, I think the overarching point here, the overall goal is that we would we would exhibit self-discipline. We would try to adhere to these. And I think there's more pressure on the chair of every meeting to adhere to these.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if he's agreeable to that, I think I think we've got a winner here. So I'd like to stick with the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilmember Country Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Just out of curiosity, how much time we've been spending on this so far?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, Councilmember, we actually looked at the debate, that original debate before we went to council comments, believe it or not, was exactly 30 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There we go. We're almost downtown. Sorry. Had to recue when I think another thing a lot of this has to do with the the the the agenda itself some of the agenda items that we have in here can be in hour long.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there are some agenda items here that we can basically maybe even flavor into the consent calendar without having to. A vote on them at the end of our debate, because I know some of our council meetings have gone on and on and we still have a we still have an agenda to deal with at the end'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of a long debate. So I think maybe staff can look at these agenda items much more carefully and make more of a of a call whether we could put more agenda items on the consent calendar. And as states are here in number four, you know, we can always pull an item from the consent calendar if if any'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of us feel that we need to talk about it a little more. So I think pulling some items from the from the general regular agenda into the consent might help streamline some some of our meetings as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir, that would be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I agree with that. I think that's an excellent suggestion. I want to go back to this flexibility that we're writing in about the debate time. And here's the problem I have with, you know, with consent of the council, we can extend that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What does that mean? Do we have to then vote on it? And it has to be by majority vote? It's kind of sounds to me like a call for the question type of process. And that's a problem to me because every member of this council should feel like they could they should be included in the process, even'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if they're saying something or advocating a position that others don't agree with. Obviously, when we have people here who are advocating for one position or another, the council members with whom they agree, they'd love to hear more from the council members with whom they disagree, they'd love to hear less from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I don't want it to turn into, you know, a popularity contest where we do. That's why I hate that call for the question, because even though I may agree or disagree with my colleagues, I still respect the fact that every single one of them worked really hard and makes tremendous sacrifices to serve in this position.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I want them to be able to say what they need to say on Tuesday nights. And and so for me, you know, it's not I don't who's the judge of if what you're saying is significant enough to continue talking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't. So that's the part that I really don't. Don't like is that fact that we'd have to take a vote. And by consent of the majority, a person would be allowed more time to talk. I just. I don't understand what we're trying to achieve with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I would I would I would ask the maker of this motion to rethink that, because I think, like like I said, I mean, there's no. I don't know what the deterrent would be for someone to violate that policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I if I could answer just a little bit of that question, the the way I would interpret the if you wanted to suspend the rules for that evening or for that particular item, that would be done by consent.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'vote to end discussion. It's similar to call for the question. So you would need as a majority to and discussion not just I mean a two thirds majority supermajority, six votes, not just a simple majority.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Again, I would just ask my colleagues to really think about that. What are we trying to accomplish there? How much time do we think we're going to save? And can you foresee a situation where we are? Excluding a member of this body based on either their content or their style or their tone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And is that fair? And so that I would just ask my colleagues to think about that. I do not think this should be an inclusive process where every single one of us who's worked, regardless of whether we agree or not, we all have families at home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We all you know, most of us have other jobs. We've all worked really hard to get here. It should not be a popularity contest. And not that this would ever happen in this body, but. Political bodies have been known to have filibusters and random things like that that happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is part of the democratic process. It takes time. It takes time to have debate and get through that process. And so I just I don't want to feel I don't look a lot of people here know this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe they don't. English is my second language. Sometimes it takes me a little bit longer to process what I'm thinking. I have to hear from other people in order for me to get to the point where I need to feel comfortable in my decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It might take me longer to articulate what I'm feeling, thinking than others. I shouldn't be at a disadvantage because of that. And I'm not just talking about me personally. Put someone else in my position who also English as their second language and needs more time to process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just I don't want to feel rushed because there's a timer on, on on me. And I want to be able to listen to my colleagues because there might be a possibility that something they say changes my mind and requires additional debate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's the only problem with this that I have, is that it limits our advocacy abilities. And I do believe that it puts some at a disadvantage based on their content, their tone, their style, or possibly the way they think as adult as adult learners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't think we should do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. We're going to we're going to go to a vote. The one thing I'll add to what the and then and I want to make sure we we get to the vote, I think and I you know, I can support what's on the table, as is councilman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe what we do also just to address some of Councilman Price's concern is we do keep the five minute, but instead of doing that hard stop at 30, we just allow for now to continue that process going so that people feel they can come back to an issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we're not limiting that. I could support that. And I think that at least that is heard. If the council's okay with that, councilman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, ma'am. I just want to make sure the city attorney is on, if that's that's clear enough.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're not. Well, the staff recommendation was at 30 minutes. Will there be an automatic point of order which the council would then have to extend debate? I think with were what we're saying is there wouldn't be an automatic point of order, but the five minute clock would continue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm not sure. I just need a little clarification. I think that there would be five minute. The way I understand it now, at 5 minutes, you would move to the next speaker and everybody can read. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At a total minute of 30 minutes. Then there would be some sort of notification to the council and you make a decision whether you continue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think what I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Going to eliminate the 30 minute I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think I think what we're saying is we keep a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Five minute, 5 minutes, but we're.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not doing the 30 minute cap. What people feel comfortable, they can come back in and continue if they need to continue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So we'll take the 30 minutes. That's correct. Five minute caveats. That's correct. As many times. Okay. Thank you. And then the the other amendment was that at the chair's discretion and that's subject to override by the council, the chair will determine the order based upon attendance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I'd like you guys to come back at that first reading and make that and make that suggestion of how we would do that. But I think we're trying to basically enshrine the practice we already do.'",

Many of these obstacles are things like acquiring the proper documentation and identification in order to gain access to services. There are strict rules and regulations around services, insufficient amount of services, lack of transportation and lack of trust.'",

It alleviate some of the pressure off of patrol units and helps the police department provide the most public, good possible quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the street team work together in coordinated outreach. The officers ensure the safety of the team and provides access to locations the team may not visit. Normally, enforcement is conducted very rarely and strategically. In my personal field work sample of 109 outreach interactions, only 15 included some form of enforcement, like a citation or arrest.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Instead, the quality of life officers focused on building rapport, learning what their needs, the needs of the people they're meeting are, and figuring out how they can help the people they meet. There's a lot more detail on page nine that I invite you to look at.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Okay, you guys, that was amazing. Amazing. First of all, I want to say this booklet that you've created is so dense with information. It covers so many different topics that we have studied here as a counsel in our study sessions on homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It talks about housing. It talks about the importance of outreach. It talks about obstacles to getting into services like the lack of identification alone, just not having an ID. What that does for individuals who want a service. This document right here is just unbelievable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I'm going through it here. You talk about some of the legal hurdles we've had, some of the changes in the law and how that's impacted our homeless population. I really think you should apply for some sort of an award for this research project because this summarizes a lot of what we see every day, and it's'",

And I just have to tell you guys, I wish I wish there were more people here to hear this presentation because this is unlike anything we've seen from it, especially from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a college, you know, department with student labor. So thank you. And I want to thank our homeless outreach team. I've had the opportunity and feel incredibly blessed for the continuing opportunity to be able to join the Street team on some outreach efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the work that the street teams do is just unbelievable. Anytime anyone reaches out to me about a not my backyard type issue, I say, Would you like to go on a homeless ride along? Because I think once they do, it really changes their perspective about what it takes to get someone into a service.'",

I had a a meeting a couple of weeks ago with the lottery, with Wetlands Authority, and there they have, as you know, a very serious homeless problem that goes into the wetlands and in those areas'",
        "'speaker_11': '. You missed that meeting. But but I was there and we had a presentation done by the Quality of life officers from that Long Beach PD there. And what they basically brought forward was the fact that it it it can become a law enforcement issue, but it's a quality of life issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And for many of those homeless individuals that were there, their compassion and their ability to communicate with the homeless people that were there was just absolutely phenomenal. They were able to have that those 15 or 17 point of contact, but more like ten or even less because they were they showed such an amount of of humanity to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'these individuals that it helped them reconnect with family, reconnect with society, get themselves cleaned up and get back into into the mainstream. And a lot of a lot of what we deal with with homelessness is not you know, we look at it as a law enforcement issue or maybe in an economic issue or socio economic issue, but'",
        "'speaker_11': 'it's a human issue. And if we are able to treat our fellow human beings more with more with greater sense of humanity, I think we would go a long way in addressing the homeless issues that we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I was looking for the chief a little while ago because I want to get those names of those officers that that work in that area. Because they made a presentation that was just heartbreaking. I mean, it was it was it showed so much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those guys really need a badge, not a badge. Merit medal for for all the work that they do out there, because they were doing phenomenal work in reaching out to these homeless people and getting them back into the into the mainstream to make them back into society.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this report here is absolutely wonderful. It basically documents what a lot of us already know. But you did the research and you did. You collected the data that just basically proves what we may already know or or perceive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's in it's all right here. So I agree with Councilmember Price that this could be a good policy document for us to look at and to determine what directions we want to take and where do we want to spend our money.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And obviously, one thing that I can glean from this right now and how you worked already with with these other officers, is that we need to basically put a moral commitment into quality of life issues and quality of life efforts that would do a more direct outreach into the homeless community so that so we could bring in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'bring them back in, into society and connect them with their families and with the mainstream. So I want to thank all the work you've done. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excellent work. We have had the quality of life officers and the outreach team to many of our community meetings. But one of the things that I think is poignant is when a encampment is in a particular community, that's when the community adjacent is most open to understanding and listening and hearing the difference between perceptions realities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a lot of crossover jurisdictional issues between Long Beach City, Caltrans, L.A. County, who's in charge? When L.A. County, when Long Beach goes through to offer services. Oftentimes, they won't take the services till the day before the cleanup.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How do we work on that efficiency? Is there an opportunity for us to work with, say, L.A. County so that they're noticing requirements match the adjacent city? Because one of the things that we consistently have as a challenge is as the city resource team goes around and meets with different individuals and cleans up those areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They move to areas that have longer notice periods and then the neighbors who live adjacent to those area areas have different levels of frustration. And with that frustration comes a reduction in tolerance and compassion. And so we need to kind of be able to figure out and balance the ways in which we can interact and solve this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as a whole. So I really appreciate this. I would love a digital copy so that I can do a better job sharing this with my network and our community leaders. I think that this is a great document as a starting point, but it also love to meet with any of you or all of you about your policy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'recommendations on how we could better pull together. Because I know in my district and actually in almost all of our districts, we have so many cross jurisdictional issues where it's, councilwoman, why can't you do something? And the area they're asking about is not within our jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then the frustration of where the funding comes from and how it can be used and what it can and can't be used for. Excellent work and we have a lot more work to do. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Super now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks. I'd also like to thank Councilmember Price for bringing this item forward. I agree. Just an awesome publication. Great job. I would say at the highest levels of professionalism, it's hard to believe this was done by students. I did see on page four that it's titled The Street Sharks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That has nothing to do with the new mascot for coastal languages.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I thought about that and I think we're all aligning here. So we're all we're all about the beach now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Well, President Connelly is going to be at my next community meeting at the end of the month. I'll make sure I point that out to her and to Teresa and Shannon, thank you for being here tonight. And we all know on the dais here how important they are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In fact, let me just say this. I never thought of your outreach team as sharks, but let's let's explore that a little bit. But the rapport with the council office is so key and because we communicate all the time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I just want to acknowledge that and thank you for assisting the group.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And finally, Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to say thank you so much for your work. I see the methodologies that people really need to understand when we're out there reaching, you know, the most vulnerable of our populations. So thank you very much for this work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also to Shannon and Teresa. I know you're amplifying a lot of their work. And oftentimes as a councilmember, when I'm explaining this to downtown residents, it doesn't come off very well. They're just thinking that I'm just, you know, not explaining it or they don't understand it or they don't believe me any of the above.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think this will be a really good way to present it. And I would love to invite you to some of our meetings in downtown to just talk about this report. It would be really great to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Is there any other public comment outside the presentation? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can I get.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Out? Let me go ahead, please.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'There's there's so many partnerships that the university has with the city, similar projects like this with other departments, whether it's engineering or the innovation work happening or with business. And so many projects where students are getting hands on experience and doing work that benefits one the city.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll turn it over to Alex.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor, and members of the city council. As indicated, I'd like to introduce Christina Kostin, who's a human resources officer who oversees our city's Equal Employment Opportunity and training division. Christina will give a presentation today covering the 2018 City of Long Beach Workforce Demographic Report.'",

In 2017, members of the City Council requested the city manager to report on workforce and applicant diversity data on an annual basis until such time an online dashboard is implemented.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Since presenting the 2017 Workforce Report to City Council, H.R. and the Technology Innovation Department met to discuss potential vendors for the online dashboard and next steps for moving the project forward, noting the dashboard will not be ready for public release until 2028 and Civil Service worked diligently to release this report, which we are here to present to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you today. The 2018 City of Workforce Demographics report examines the city's workforce as of December 31st, 2018. The report covers all city employees summarizing statistics by gender, ethnicity, age and salary as an enhancement to last year's report. Civil service applicant flow data is presented by EEO job categories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Looking at the data on the city's workforce. The city remains one of the largest employers in Long Beach, with 6104 employees represented across 23 departments and 2018 employees, earning a median annual salary of $72,401. It is noted that in 2018 the city increased ethnic minority representation in the workforce from 59% to 62%, a 3% increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Currently, 60% of our workforce is classified. Ah. Sorry. Currently, 6% of our workforce is classified service. As such, human resource collaborates with civil service because our ability to have a diverse workforce is dependent on the availability of a diverse and qualified civil service candidate pool.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Drilling down on race and ethnicity. The city's ethnic minority workforce is divided as follows Asian, 14%, black, 13%. Latina, 34%. And Native American 1%. Recently, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission revised racial categories to include two or more races.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city anticipates incorporating this new category after the launch of LBE Coast. In terms of gender. 38% of our total workforce is female. Compared to City of Los Angeles, city of Santa monica, city of Sacramento and City of Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city of Long Beach ranks number two for female representation. In comparing our 2017 and 2018 Workforce Demographics report, we identify several areas of improvement. The data indicates we have made great progress with workforce diversity to include increasing our total minority representation in the workforce from 59% to 62%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A 3% increase. Increasing staffing levels by 8% through strategic succession planning. And streamlined efforts to decrease timelines for filling a vacancy. Decreasing the pay gap between women and men for permanent full time employment from $0.81 to $0.85 a 4% increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Increasing total ethnic minority representation in police recruits from 60% to 70%. A 10% increase. And increasing ethnic minority representation in top management from 28% to 46%. An 18% increase. And increasing representation of female applicants for police recruit by 6%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And females hired by 2%. The city's ultimate objective is to establish a diverse workforce that is reflective of the relevant labor market in the community we serve. To achieve this objective, the city will continue outreach efforts in recruitment to obtain a qualified applicant pool that is representative of all ethnic and gender categories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'While the overall picture of city workforce demographics is headed in the right direction, we drove the data down further to identify areas that warrant an additional look in an effort to be proactive in our efforts, creative in our approach, and adaptable to the ever changing demographic realities of Long Beach, the city intends to monitor the following four'",
        "'speaker_1': 'areas for opportunities to grow. One Hiring and retention of black and Latino employees. While other ethnic minority groups held steady or increase, blacks seen relatively slow growth, with nearly 2% decline in overall representation in the workforce. Also, hiring of black applicants into classifieds service decreased by 4% despite the reduction in black workforce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Citywide representation of black employees in the civilian workforce still meets or exceeds relevant labor market data for the Latino population. The city experienced a 4% increase in citywide representation. While this is a step in the right direction, the city has yet to align current staffing with relevant labor market data for Latino populations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city will continue to monitor progress in these areas to ensure adequate representation compared to relevant labor market data. A second area we identified is the recruitment of females into male dominated fields from 2017 to 2018. The total female representation in the workforce remained unchanged at 38%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is largely due to the city having several male dominated job categories, such as protective services, technicians, skill, track, skill, craft and service maintenance. In 2018, these categories accounted for nearly 59% of permanent full time hiring. Moving the needle for female representation and closing the city's pay gap will require strategic recruitment of FEMA applicants into male dominated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fields, such as sworn and skilled craft. A third area we identified is the fire recruit diversity. In 2018, the number of ethnic minority applicants for fire recruit increased by 3%, despite a growth in the number of ethnic minority applicants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Representation overall hiring decreased. Currently, the city manager's office is collaborating with the Fire Department and Civil Service to review the selection process for fire recruit. This includes seeking to identify and implement best practices for improving diversity. As the fourth area we identified.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We looked at retirement eligibility as of December 31st, 2018, 16% of the city's workforce is currently eligible for retirement. This number is expected to grow to 25% or nearly one in four employees within the next five years. This presents opportunity to increase diversity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As part of the 2017 request, Council requested the city work with Technology Innovation Department to implement an online dashboard. Currently, the Technology Innovation Department is diligently working with Openserve, the vendor used for budget LBE to build an online dashboard that will allow data on employee demographics to be easily visualized through interactive charts and graphs similar to those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on the City of Portland and City of Boston's website. Staff anticipates going live with the dashboard no later than January 1st, 2020. So that concludes our staff report, and we're available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Let me first going to the contrary, Ringo actually brought this to the council. First, let me start with the contrary, Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mayor. This is an excellent report. It's something that I've been waiting for for a long time. I remember when I first brought this forward a few years back. It wasn't quite at the level that it is now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm very happy that, you know, sometimes some reports are worth waiting for, and it is one of them. One of the things obviously that came forward is that we're still hiring more. Well, just explain to me a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On page 91, you have the breakdown in white, Asian, black, black, Macs, Native American. When you say white in that category, is that white, male and female or just white male? What is it? What does that category explain?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What point out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are you referring to the bottom graph. That's race and ethnicity. Yes, that is concludes male and female.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So, I mean, you could see those numbers that still more whites are being hired at twice the level of any other ethnicity by itself and more than all combined. So we still have some work to do in this area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Obviously. I think we still need to have outreach out there to into the people of color and the and disadvantaged communities. We need to reach out more to them. And obviously that this this needs to go through that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Obviously also is the fact that, you know, when we look at the hiring practices, it's no secret that we hire those that look like us. So I think we need to improve also our representation in the management ranks of minorities and women and people of color so that we can make some changes in those areas as well'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Seeing the other the other data that's there, it's it stands out as well. So but overall, I can say that it's well done. I still would like an explanation as to what the dashboard would exactly provide and how it will be used in the future coming 2020.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what would that be? How meaningful will it be for the city council and having a dashboard of this nature? Can you can you sort of give an orientation as to what it's going to be or is it too premature?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, last year when this item was brought.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Out, there were a couple of examples that were given to us to look at. We also looked at other agencies that well as well. I think we're still working with Open with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'T.I. and will be will be developing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What that dashboard is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is going to look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But primarily what we're aiming for is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To provide that data so that individuals can go to the website and access the data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Readily, very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Easily. And we are also looking at having some ready made tables and graphs that are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very popular for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People to access with these as well. So again, the goal is for is to allow folks to access the data and slice and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dice it to suit their needs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A lot of the information that we have in here is about classified positions and jobs. I didn't see or be overlooked it in regards to how we're doing in the at will position to the non-classified positions. Is that information in here as well?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It may put me out to it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we also the report also contains.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Information about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Management positions which.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are primarily.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Unclassified. And in this area, we did report that we have significantly increased the number of ethnic minorities in this area over last year when we compared 2017 and 2018.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, that's management. But I was talking about other unclassified positions in the general workforce, such as and classified analysts. As an example.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clarification, are you asking for the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Data to be provided.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As on page 91.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or because they are included in the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Other charts that are is the bulk of the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Oh, you're in general speaking like for example, I would classify positions like refuge worker or recreation specialist. I know there are some administrative analysts who are assistant analysts positions out there that are unclassified. Are those also included in this report somewhere?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. So if they're.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Full time employees, they were included in the report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Part time employees as well. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. Thank you. In recruitment, there's are we still having people go visit colleges and universities and community based organizations to let people know about job opportunities with the city?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Councilmember, we are actively attending.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Job fairs, community events. For example, recently we were out at the Cambodian New Year Festival and a number of community events and job fairs each week.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. We are going to be having a table at the Long Beach Parade.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir. We will be out there all weekend.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Wonderful. Glad to hear that. Well, one last thing. I know there was a statement made about the some of the positions are male dominated, or at least not many females go to those types of jobs. I think that especially when talking about public safety positions like police and fire, I think we can do better in those areas'",
        "'speaker_11': 'by having a targeted recruitment to get those individuals into our police and fire departments. One of the other things about that is that, generally speaking, I don't public safety has taken a big hit in the last couple of years, especially with all the incidents that have been taken or been taking place across the country.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So maybe that a lot of people are not looking at those as as viable professions or careers. But I think that it's important for us to have the face of law enforcement and public safety out there. So I'm sure that you have some representatives from the police and fire departments who may be able to join you in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'some of these recruitment efforts so that they can provide a greater opportunity for explaining what they do and how they do it so that we could put more people on on that track for that kind of career. So are you working with the police and fire departments to have recruitment teams work with you and go out into'",
        "'speaker_11': 'these these areas?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember, we are working closely with police and fire at these.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Events and whenever possible we do bring out members of the police.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And fire department who are representative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the groups that we are working to to target.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Well, that's a lot of questions I have, but thank you for your report and looking forward to getting a dashboard to see how to how it comes out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you and thank you so much to Councilmember Ranga for bringing this forward from the beginning. And I love this report. It's going to take me a while to them through it. But I will say the two data points that stuck out to me and we've addressed it in the beginning was the pay gap, $0.85 to every'",
        "'speaker_3': 'dollar on the woman and man side and then just the female representation. I would like us to look at, you know, just especially emphasizing the departments that I kind of listed here that are under that 30% representation overall, both in the management and the Non-Management side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I'm seeing some that are pretty big outliers. Like the airport only has 8% female employees fire 10%. Of course, public works 19%. Tech and innovation, 27%. Economic development, 17%. And I know we're working on that. But if there are specific.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Specific marketing tools that we could. We can work on that could be specific to women in attracting employees women employees. That would be really great and know. Just recently, the tech and innovation team was at the Women in Tech Conference, which was really great and I hope to see more of that and I know we will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'll just emphasize that. But thank you again for the work. And I know that we're going to continue to create a profile that evolves here in the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember. I skipped councilmember austin who was a second or the motion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I just want to thank staff for the great report. This is a lot of good data to digest today and tomorrow moving forward as we understand our workforce here at the city. I want to just say that one couple of points jumped out at me, and one is that we need to be developing a good'",
        "'speaker_8': 'bench when it comes to management. It shows that within the next five years, we're going to lose, you know, over 40% of the managers here in the city. And so certainly we need to be developing a good, good bench as folks are planning to be retiring.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There was I agree with that. The number on the gender pay gap I think is improving, but shows that we still have room to improve significantly. And the one demographic group that I don't see here and would like to see in the future is disability recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, those with disabilities and how are we recruiting and providing opportunities for those in the workforce as well? Those are my brief comments. I want to commend Councilmember Durango for for his tenacity and making sure that this information was presented to us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know this has been a pet project for his for for several years. And to have this report is is quite an accomplishment. So congrats.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. On price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I, too, want to thank Councilman Saranga for initiating this work. Staff did a great job. I will say that I feel that the city manager has really tried to make this a priority in recruiting. Of course there's more work to be done, but I want to commend him on understanding that this is a goal, while'",
        "'speaker_3': 'at the same time trying to find the best qualified candidates for each of these positions so that we're being efficient with our use of resources, not exposing ourselves to unnecessary liability and things of that nature. So I realize that, you know, his his ability to hire the type of diversity that we're looking for that represents the diversity'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of this city is really limited to the type of candidates he gets in the pool. And so anything that we can do to help proactively train, recruit. Route folks to these professions as a city, an early stage, I think we should do taking advantage of people who have interned here, people who have worked in staff positions and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'learned the culture and are looking forward to come back. I think that those individuals should really get some priority in terms of being considered for employment with the city, even if they are not an outside candidate. That has more qualification.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And so the EEO plan will be what guides the movement. Right. Because the last EEO plan was 13 to 17. So the next one helps guide the movement, sort of how we move the needle in the future. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a point in time report. But the EEO plan is where we make, you know, our suggestions on where we go. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. But the EEO plan also.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Provides data a little differently. It does a more deeper dove by job EEO category.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we look into and compare the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City's workforce compared to the relevant labor market data.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the reason I ask is because when we look at the gender pay gap here, the appropriate place to set a policy or a goal around closing gender pay gap, what the appropriate document would be the EEO plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that could be a question for the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry, counsel. Could you repeat that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'City attorney or H.R.? So if we wanted to put forward a goal or a policy around closing the gender pay gap so it would be appropriate in the EEO plan or some other document.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think it probably would be appropriate with the AEO plan. We can also take that back and come up with some recommendations. Sure. I will share that some of the challenges with the pay gap for a government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Agency like the city of Long Beach and we have looked at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Other agencies, is when you have a workforce that's heavily male dominated, especially in areas of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Public safety, which are usually higher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Paid positions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That can skew the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Data. So it is important when we look at this skill gap that we take account of that. Otherwise we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Skewing our data. And so we have to consider all those factors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And that's that's why I think in the EEO plan, you look at specific like classifications where you can compare apples to apples, whereas this there cluster with officials, administrators or non-management management. So you can't really tell where the swing of the skew is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But in the EEO plan, you can see what women police officers make versus female police officers, white male versus female. And so that's where where I think I'd like to see how we can be creative about putting forth a goal or a policy or something when that comes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Next thing I'll lift up is on page 31. The Health Department, I think in most departments you'll see, you know, male dominated. And then on page 31, you see that it's incredibly, you know, female dominated. And I don't know that health is necessarily an issue that's, you know, gender specific.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it's health. But why do you think that is? Most departments, many of these departments are really male heavy. And then the Helping Human Services Department is completely flipped. Why do you think that is? 87% female in officials, administrators and 73% in non-management.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why do we think that is?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, that could be due to a number of factors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are some job categories that are female dominated. If you look at, for example, office clerical type positions or accounting type positions. So there are some areas where like it's it's completely opposite. So I haven't dug deeper.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On health.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I mean, is it deep? It's it's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I'd have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To look at the different job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Classifications.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I think I think they're doing something right. So we can we can certainly learn from that. The next thing on page 78, I just see a deep a deep racial pay gap in the harbor department. And so I'd like to just call out the Harvard Department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They should they should be thinking about are they under the same EEO plan as we are or do they have their own local plan? The port.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we do include them in our EEO plan when we report out. So we include all our city departments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Including Harbor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But they don't have their own local strategy that they deploy or they are accountable to this. On the plane.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not aware if they have there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We should look into that or else or just express that. I see a you know, a more significant gap here than other departments. Not quite sure why, but it is something I think we should address. And let's see.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think I'm fine. I'm pretty good here. I in general, I think there's again, this is this has been a really a, you know, really informative item. And I really look forward to the conversation around the the EEO plan where you can sort of set some set, you know, sets and take a look at the policy around'",
        "'speaker_7': 'what we do in terms of recruitment. Oh, I remember the last thing was, I think we need to be I know there are some plans list listed on fire fighter diversity and I see the issue here. But I think.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we need to take a closer look at that and and make some, you know, make some changes some make some real changes to to the recruitment process and the fire department to make sure that we're you know, that we're putting a real emphasis on diversity in our fire department because it's our police department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Looks like they've got some really positive progress from numbers. But I want to see better. I want to see more come out of our fire department. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I do want to point out with fire that that is something that we recognize. We have a full effort going underway right now to do research on fire diversity. What can we be doing better? Where can we be doing outreach?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'How do we make sure we're bringing more diverse people into our fire department? So that's an effort headed up right now by the fire chief.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you. First of all, I would like to thank Councilman Elanga for bringing this report, you know, forward, because the fact that, like he said, it's a long time and we've been kind of waiting on it. It's here now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think and and also the report is a fantastic report. You were just also. But I would just like to say in some of these and reading just quickly through this, I think some of these things are very, very, you know, way out of balance here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so now that our city manager has a chance to see a lot of them, I think in time we will be able to bring a lot of these things closer, you know, where it should be. And thank you very much for this report, Councilman Durango.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I want to first thank Councilman Herring. I know you have really pushed and and pushed on this issue. And I think having the state in front of us is really important. And so I want to thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A couple of things I just wanted to ask staff of all the department from a I can see the the improvements happening on on the gender on with gender. And I love seeing that progress that we're making as relates to pay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think there needs to be obviously a focus of us moving forward on ethnicity and on what what department is having the most issues around diversity. Is that? Which one is that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It could.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I it's kind of difficult to answer that question because.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When it comes to like the non man, the, the non management which is the largest group.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of the Non-Management category, which department is having the hardest time recruiting diverse candidates and hiring them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would say fire department is challenge with diversity. I will just tell you that from my experience, fire service is one of the areas that's most difficult to improve. Diversity is especially with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gender.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and diversity in general. So there has to be a concerted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Effort to try to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Address that. And as Tom indicated, we city manager is working.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With the fire department to to to work on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That and take a closer look at what are the challenges and how how we can address that one or the other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So and so we have our largest challenges that you're seeing in the fire. And I think that, Mr. Monica, you had mentioned that there's a an effort within that department to to look at that as an issue. And I want I want to just echo that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That effort. I think, you know, it should be obviously supported. And and I'm sure the chief is pushing on that. Let me just also say, I want to lift up the police department. And I think that what I see here with the with the police department is really great diversity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's not always been the case. And I think one of the things you hear from the community is that that the department represents the community of which it serves. And I'm not saying that we have it exactly right, but I think that there is clearly been an effort from the leadership and from the the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the recruitment that is that is quite impressive. I that's not something that you see everywhere. And so I just wanted to note note that and I want to thank the chief for for his efforts in that area. Let me also just ask.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This the. And maybe you said it earlier and I missed it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Report? How are we tracking this? I feel like we should be getting an update regularly with this type of data. What? What what's the process for this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we brought this report in 2017. And so this is the second time we brought this report. This this report. The data would change after you do hiring. So, you know, if you're looking at frequency, I think it is appropriate to look at it on an annual basis so you can capture and look at any meaningful changes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one way or another.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'd like to ask Customary Ranga for a friendly that this type of data and report be made to the council at a council meeting on an annual basis, and that we review it with this level of detail and that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What are the my concerns about the dashboard is that, you know, it would probably take that away because it's going to be readily available.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I support and I support the dashboard. I have no issue to the dashboard. I think it's important for for this body to, on an annual basis, review the data as presented and so that we're able to track the progress and the goals that the management has set for the organization.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if you accept that as a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Amendment, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Seeing as there any public comment on this item.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. Mayor can make one comment. You mentioned about police and fire, if we can comment about that. Sure. So earlier this year in the past year, we really turned the Office of Civic Innovation loose with a partnership with the police department to really look at overall hiring.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'How do we speed the hiring process for police? How do we streamline that? And we also really looked at diversity. So we're taking that same model and using the diversity component for the fire department. So we're really getting into the data and that that'll be something that would be happy to report to you on later.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we are really excited by the progress that you noted in police and looking to replicate that in fire as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for public comment.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just wanted to thank the city staff for the presentation and the report. It's good to see that as the demographics of the city overall is changing within time in time of the census into more minority representation, it's also being reflected in the workforce.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Some of the points I wanted to bring up, maybe if you're maybe you guys, whenever 2020 it comes into public, I can look at it. But it was curious to see like the impact of means testing in regards to minority representation and hiring.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I know that within certain departments. I spoke to Chief Luna a couple of weeks ago with him and I think I don't know Wally English. English. I don't want to speak his name about the impact of means testing in minority applicants to the police department.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm sure that also impacts also the fire department and the fact that I don't believe that there is a African-American recruit recruitment officer there. So I was just curious to see how things like student loans or, you know, the impact of housing or lack of housing in a lower credit score impacts how many minorities actually pass rounds'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of the application process. And also in regards to minorities being reflected better within the workforce. Was curious to see what are incentives that city staff or the city workforce in general uses to bring, you know, younger minorities into the workforce.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In terms of housing, I think like there's a maybe that might be a big issue why a lot of minorities don't come into working within the city because of the current housing crisis that we're living in right now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the last thing I was wondering was also in response to the Latin next representation within the the workforce demographic was curious if this is or is this counting a non non-Hispanic what is the delineation between white Hispanic and non Hispanic white in terms of the makeup of it?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So other than that, thank you for the report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I want to say that I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. I went upstairs to pump and I could hear all of everything, everything said except for when I was in the elevator. So I really appreciate the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I really think that an excellent job was done. And I am also very, very proud of the work our police department has done. I mean, it is really phenomenal when you read the numbers on a national level and see what's being done here in Long Beach, it's actually phenomenal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that another point of clarification with regard to fire is that the fire workforce and when we onboard people has a definite impact because most of our police and fire participants stay in our agencies for a considerable amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that change takes a considerable amount of time. And something that L.A. County has recently visited is that the requirements for becoming a police officer and a firefighter have changed because the duties and responsibilities and technology available has changed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So an example of that is there's a current test component that the L.A. County fire chief was discussing that used to be required of firefighters because of the way that the equipment was made back in the seventies. And yet that test component had not changed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that test component was the number one fail component for females joining the agency. And so I think that not just the recruitment side, but also the qualification side and making sure that the tests that we have are in alignment with the actual maneuvers that are performed on the job on a daily basis, so that once they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'become a member of our team, that they're successful, but that they're also not barred from becoming a member of our team by not being able to do something that's no longer necessary. So thank you for all the work on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's an exceptional report and I'm glad we postponed it a week so we could have the appropriate amount of time to weigh in and read the details. So thank you very much. Great work, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilman Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just want to quickly commend the Long Beach Fire Department for promoting the very first woman to battalion chief this year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. Thank you. And I want to as we go to as we go to close, I just I know it's been said a few times, I just have to say it one more time that these police rank and file numbers, comparatively to other cities are are incredibly impressive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just hope, Mr. West, that, you know, the chief's not here, but I just hope that you and I will personally just uplift that work and and support that goal. It's been, I know, important for many communities in the city for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I want to uplift that work. So great work and look forward to the update a year from now. Councilman Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember Mungo brought up a point. Maybe sometime during the future we could have a civil service give us a general presentation as to the testing process for police and fire so that to get a better, we will get a better understanding.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Ever since we did the wood fire one on one, we haven't had an orientation like that since. So maybe bringing a civil service up here sometime in the near future to talk about the testing process, police and fire would be very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. And with that, please cast your votes for the receiver for final report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries.'"
