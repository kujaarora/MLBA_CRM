        "'speaker_9': 'This practice is opposed by practically every reputable mental health professional organization in the country because it is not evidence based and is potentially harmful to a patient's mental health. In 2012, California became the first state in the nation to prohibit conversion therapy for any patients under age 18, a law that has been upheld in the courts.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I too agree. That the practice of undue persuasion of an individual, male or female regarding their sexual preference and decision. It's something that is no longer needed. When God who has created men and women, decides by his spirit to start to re influence his people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we will see across the nation, which includes this city. Is that men and women will buy under the influence of their Creator. God will begin some looking in the mirror. And they're going to say, I no longer want this lifestyle and they're going to do it of their own volition without any physical coercion or mistreatment.'",

I would ask that the city attorney would address that, because with SB 35, you can no longer have those kind of requirements on a property.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'and if the developer takes away this cul de sac, will there be parking for the neighbors that are there now and for whoever moves in in the new development? They are allowed, as I understand, under the leeway to put in a five storey mixed use on this property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that will require. A sequel. Which was not done last year because it was planned for a different thing. So I just hope you'll take a good look. And also, I am astounded about how cheaply the city is letting this land go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It looks like they're getting $10,000 a fee. And this is, as Janet said, either they're getting 10,000 or 20,000. We couldn't figure out from the staff report whether they're going to get another 10,000 in addition to what they've already put up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this would mean that you're selling public land for either one or $2 per square foot, which is much less the market price. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Sure I'd be happy to address some of the comments that came forward. Tonight is the final step within the vacation process. That process has multiple steps. When that the vacation went to the planning commission, their role is to find that it's consistent with the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the planning commission did that the fees that the underlying property is owned by the property owners that are already present. It is not owned by the city. What the action tonight does is relinquish the city's rights, the city's easement rights to be on the property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Once that those rights are relinquished, the underlying ownership reverts back to the original owners. So it was never a situation where the city is selling anything. We never owned the property in terms of the fees within the city's fee schedule.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are adopted fees that cover the city's cost of processing the vacations and the total fees. The $10,000 is the second half of fees, so the total is approximately $20,000 to do that. And that's what's being covered tonight also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can you please explain? So in other words, this is a private business to a private business type of transaction, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what's happening tonight is the city is making a finding that the property is not needed for public benefit. So there is no circulation need or any other public benefit type of a need. So we're relinquishing our right to use the property and it goes back to the underlying owner who already owns the properties, which are the'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Councilwoman Price, the RFP set that direction out and we are encouraged by what we see and that's why we need this pilot program as we move forward. We made a lot of demands as a police department and as a city, not just for what the police department needed, but we had to be sensitive to the technological needs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of the city. So that's the reason for the length of the pilot program. We want to make sure that when we come back to this council that I am recommending to you through the city manager that this is the best option for us as a city to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And I appreciate that answer. So the reason for the length of the. Pilot is for us to look at the operational aspects of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We will be looking at everything. We will be looking at the equipment, the logistics of it, the storage from one end to the other, their staffing considerations that we're looking at. One of the things we learned from the previous pilot program is that, as you know, the men and women of this police department are working their tails'",
        "'speaker_4': 'off. I have not too much fat even in people. And as we move forward with this pilot program, we hope to introduce more staffing, which is going to be needed and required to effectively run it on our side of the fence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we'll be looking at that. How smooth is that? And then we'll be working with our partners in the city to make sure the technology works. And that's one thing we're we're asking Axon to do is to come in with a plan on how they're going to operate within the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you know, we're geographically spread out and we do have some challenges, some challenges historically in regards to our outdated technology from a city perspective.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And I understand that, Chief, and I appreciate that answer. I guess the question I'm asking is. And so some of the reasons why. Let me let me just say that based on my experience, a one year pilot is a very long pilot with Axon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I work in a county where nine out of our ten agencies are using Axon. And we've where we've talked we've had 30 day pilots. We've had several month pilots. A one year pilot is a long time. And so from an operational standpoint, I think one year I would like us to get the police department as online as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'soon as possible, because I believe body cameras protect not just the individuals who come into contact with the police officers, but also the police officers who are often alleged to have participated in conduct that in fact, upon viewing the body cameras, they did not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do so from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A city liability issue. And from a justice standpoint, I think the body cameras, the faster we can roll them out, the better. So what I'm hearing is that in addition to having time to look at the operational aspects, that there may be some staffing needs that might also present a financial challenge for us to get up and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'running and deploy agency wide. And I'm wondering because looking at the that the proposed contract that we could have, that we can terminate a one year pilot with 30 days notice, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Approximately. Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. Okay. So because I think that's what the the the staff report says. So we could. If we were to bring this back in six months, we could at that point evaluate the city's available resources to augment perhaps the budget in order to allow staffing and roll out an agency, a department wide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Body camera program as opposed to continuing with the pilot for an additional six months. And during that six months that we've done the pilot, we can have the opportunity to evaluate what our realistic staffing needs might be. Because we might have just looking at this and I don't question anybody's judgment, I understand what we think the staffing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is going to be, but it could be that we don't have as many praise requesting body worn camera as we're expecting. We don't have as many redactions as we're expecting. It could be that we don't need the number of positions, the eight positions that we've requested in in a pilot would also reveal that information as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one of the reasons why we want to do a one year pilot to make sure that we are positive, whether it comes with pre staffing and everything you just mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So you believe that if resources were not an issue, you believe that a one year pilot would be best for our agency?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I talk about resources, I am very concerned about our internal resources, but I'm also concerned about the logistics from a technology perspective, from a city perspective, just to make sure that we can do that across the board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I mean, I think there are a lot of cities that are using Axon that are far less sophisticated than we are with technology. So I'm not aware of any technological hurdles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's exactly why I want to do a one year pilot program. Could it be less? It absolutely could. But when I come back to this council, I think my job is to provide you with every answer that all of you all answer, any questions that any of you may have regarding every box that I need to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'check to make sure that we're making a very wise investment because this is expensive. I agree with you. I think it's a necessary tool, but it's going to take some significant funding or a significant budget enhancement for us to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I get that completely and I agree with you completely. I guess what I'm trying to say is. As the chief, putting aside budget constraints, putting aside your concerns about where the money could come from, would you want to see this program deployed agency wide sooner than one year?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I understand that, you know, you don't as a as the director of the department, you have to think about policy decisions in combination with fiscal constraints. I get that. But what I'm what I'm trying to do is figure out if we were to come back in a while, in a few months and six months, and we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can look at our financial situation at that point and we were able to roll it out agency wide. Is that something that we could do in less than a year? And if the answer to that is no, then I get it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I will say a yearlong pilot is a very long pilot for a program that agencies far less sophisticated than ours have rolled out very efficiently with zero problems. I met with liaisons today from multiple police agencies in Orange County, much some smaller than are, some around the same size.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the rollout has honestly been flawless. The discovery process, the use of evidence dot com. There have been very few glitches. And so what I'm saying is, assuming we are entering into a partnership with an organization who has learned lesson for within it, with a provider that has learned lessons and we're the beneficiary of the lessons learned'",
        "'speaker_3': ', could we implement this agency wide? Because I'll be as clear and direct as I can be. I think we need to have body cameras for all of Long Beach Police Department as soon as possible. And that's what I'm trying to establish with you, Chief, as if finances were not an issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could we do it sooner? And if finances are the issue, could we maybe come back in six months and think about whether or not we want to roll it out for the full agency?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can promise you an all out effort in trying to do what we can do, but I would have to reprogram my mind because there's a lot of things I'd like to do that we have money restraints on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I get it. Thank you. Just one final question. Have we determined whether or not the pilot policy is going to have the activation is going to be a discretionary or mandatory policy for the officers?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our current draft policy, which has been in existence for over a year, mandates that the officers record enforcement contacts. It's not optional.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. That's very good. A couple of best practice suggestions that I might make is that the policy and of course this would have to go back to. The members to to approve. But one of the things we have found in terms of best practices is there are times when officers will have to deactivate their body camera, whether'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's for a restroom break or whether it's because a victim or someone has asked that they be allowed to do so by indicating such by speaking into the body camera before they disengage. And I don't know if we have something like that in our policy, but to allow for that flexibility such that in those situations, the officer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can articulate why they're turning off the camera by speaking into the body cam before turning it off. Is that a policy that we have or could look into as part of the pilot?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. The other thing lessons learned is that we have several agencies who entered into an agreement with Axon not anticipating some of the storage issues that might come up. So I don't know what the terms of our contract will be, but if we can try to get an unlimited storage with Axon, I don't know if that's possible'",
        "'speaker_3': ', but I think that would be good because some agencies are finding themselves having to recategorized their body cameras so that the retention they fall into a certain retention policy. So if that's something that we could fold into the contract, I think that would be good for us too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Since we're going to do a pilot, we may as well get the most out of our policy. But those are just my suggestions, just from lessons learned and a few articles that I was able to find online today from experiences other agencies have had.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Axon has already offered that as part of their proposal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you very much, Chief.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Price. I'm sorry, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Two years later, still Price. I want to thank you, Police Chief, for your efforts on this. I know we've had some conversations in the past. I've had other conversations outside of our office as well. And honestly, I think that I was going to ask many of the same questions that Councilmember Price was going to ask and just'",
        "'speaker_7': 'stress that I know that a lot of costs with data storage and that there are a lot of unknowns. But I would support coming back in six months. You know, if we could come back in six months and evaluate where we're at, I think that that would be great for the council, whether or not we are identifying'",

And they and they keep to the restrictions, put on the word to them by the Constitution.'",

I just want to clarify the motion that's on the floor as this motion was placed on the agenda prior to the city, knowing that Exxon had purchased view, we'd like some flexibility to be able to enter and enter into the contract with Exxon and then discuss with them the availability'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of the Veeva, if I'm saying that correctly, camera and operating system and give PD the flexibility if available to test both of those and then come back with their recommendation on which technology meets their needs the best. So it kind of follows the spirit of what the letter and the council recommended action is today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we would have to have some additional conversations with Axon to make sure that that second technology remains available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And just before we go on to the I want to just clarify also where I think the motion is at is the motion is presented by the city attorney. I think there's also an interest that while this is a year long pilot that Chief, I know you regularly give updates obviously on it on big projects'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and that there'll be a formal one. I think it's six months I think is kind of what I'm hearing just to make sure, you know, the council's abreast at that point. That would be I think that'd be a good update for the council to have this a formal six month presentation on the pilot and with that, Councilwoman'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gonzales. Seeing no other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just had a couple of questions. Sorry. Our names. Just Scott.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, sure. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, just thank you so much, Chief, for the update. And I appreciate the questions from my council colleagues. Just one clarifying, clarifying question for the fiscal impact. It states three positions now for the testing efforts and then eight down the line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's the are those technical positions that's just overseeing the the back end work for the actual technological aspect? Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those are estimates at this point. Again, what we learned from the the first pilot program, we try to do it with one person. It just was not working. Okay. There's a lot of work that needs to be done behind the scenes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we fully implement the program. We're looking at approximately eight positions that can be adjusted down the road depending on workload. I hope it's not that much work. Maybe Axon will do such a great job. We don't need anybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I doubt it. But we'll see what we that's what the pilot programs for. We want to make sure we're bringing you the best possible scenario that our community expects from us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you. And I would just also include in that I know Axon, just from knowing them from my technological job, I know that they're looking to incorporate possibly facial recognition, which I know is something for us to just think about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it is, you know, very controversial. I know that there's a lot of issues around that. So it's just something I wanted to throw out there. But I will say to that, I know every city is a bit different, every county is a bit different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will say, you know, we're I'm so glad we have a different direction now. And when it comes to technology, we were on Lotus Notes not too long ago. I just want to remind everybody. So we're a little antiquated on that side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I know I said it. I didn't even remember we had Lotus Notes, but we did. So I just want to say we're moving ahead and I really appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I would like to add, mayor and council, that part of the investment that you've made in technology is what makes this possible. So we were running the old system because we did not have a fiber network that we could actually rely on to do this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so by investing in that fiber that's part of the status update will give you is how are we doing with fiber? Where is it? Because that's going to determine how far we can get for a citywide pilot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So with that investment, that's how we're able to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I have a follow up on that. So it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Position that we need to have fiber throughout the city in order to roll out this technology.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I understand, especially the accent system.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It requires a lot of bandwidth and it needs to go back to the station in order to be uploaded as one of the ways to do it. And so we do not have fiber to all of our police stations currently, but Caitlin can give additional info if we need it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Get them on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There we go. Honorable mayor and members of the city council. The the technology behind Axon does require higher bandwidths, but there's also a intermediate intermediary approach we can take where city council already approved in. On March the 20th, a telecommunication network expansion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that that expansion provides us the immediate capability to expand bandwidth to each of the substations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With through the installation of fiber.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct fiber fiber with the telecom providers eventually being sunsetted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And moved to city owned fiber.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I see. So at all the police stations. Correct. So we have that now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have the contractual authority to do that, and we're currently in negotiations with the telecom providers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. And there's no other further comments here. So please, members, go ahead and cast your vote. And as we do so, I just want to, you know, just to the chief and to the technology team, I know this is this is an important issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know you guys have been working very, very hard on this issue. Just the whole staff. And I think we're obviously the council is as anxious and supportive of moving forward. And so we look forward to all the results.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just thank you and your team chief. And with that, we will move on to the next item, please. That motion carries that go up on the board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next item, I believe is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Item 15th October 2015.'"

    "Contract Award for Bicycles and Equipment for Bikeshare Program Expansion.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'We did that one. That's right. We did. I think the next one is 22. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Report from Public Works Recommendation to award a contract to social buy schools for the purchase of bicycles and associated equipment for the expansion of the Long Beach Bike Share program for a total on contract amount not to exceed 431,250 citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. A short update from public works on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Craig back mayor council members, if you recall, we were before you about a month ago requesting approval to expand our bike share system and council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did grant that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Approval. We are in the process of ordering those bikes. What you have before you this evening is a further request to order another 100 bikes and why we had pulled these requests apart. This one before you this evening is from a grant source and we have a short timeline to secure those grant dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But those grant dollars would allow us to buy an additional hundred bikes and some equipment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're requesting approval to add that to the other 500 bikes that we plan to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Expand. So now we're just correct if I'm wrong, but we had we think we purchased 4 to 500 last time. Is that right, Mr.. Beck? So this is an additional hundred on top of that, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So the original bike share rollout was 500 bikes with cycle hop as a vendor cycle hop only delivered 400 of those initial 500 bikes. This 100 before you this evening is finishing up that initial 500. Not to be confusing, but then we came back and council did approve a second 500.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So when this is all said and done, we'll have 1000 bike share bikes out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In our community. And just to be clear, we have 400 out now, so we have an additional 600 coming. That is correct. Okay, great. And let me go through Councilman Andrew Smith. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. You know, I support the recommendation to stand in. It's great to see people riding along the bike path and around town. But since the bike program is now several years along, I'd like to see a progress and a performance report that includes frequent or frequency of the rental locations of the bikes and the renewal and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cost figure. You know, I think a council I think as a council person, we would appreciate to know how the progress the program is doing and if there's any way we can improve it for possible. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Pearce here. Councilmember pearce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just make making sure she.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Didn't want to speak. Councilmember. Okay. I just wanted to take this moment to say, of course, I approve and also congratulate public works on a great effort with the Amgen race this past week. I know that the love of bikes has grown in the city due to the bike share program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I agree with Councilmember Andrews. I would be interested in some statistics related to utilization. I know that as they expand across the city. One of the things that I'm very interested in is most bike share programs that I've seen as I've traveled are sponsored, whether it's Kaiser or Memorial, Barnes and Noble.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, everywhere I go, there's Sunkist. It's the wheels of the bike, our advertising, the company that pays for the entire program and then really donates back into the health of the community. And so and I know we have a sponsorship program that this council approved that is really partnered through Partners of Parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'd really like to see that either that board or US partner in some way to bring that kind of funding to the city to be able to ensure that this program has sustainability through an outside source. I appreciate you getting grant dollars and I look forward to the expansion to Eldorado Park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Quick question, because I'm unclear, are these the North Long Beach bikes?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think Councilmember, we've had had a you and I have had a discussion that our next expansion will go up through Bixby and in the north Long Beach. It's a combination of both these bikes and the previous approved 500.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So these are going. These bikes are going in North Palm Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are the previous ones.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So these are not. I'm just want a yes or no.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Yes. These are very.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Confusing. All right. These are the North Lambie's bikes where they come in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need to order them through the company. They have roughly a 4 to 6 month delivery time. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Six months from now, we'll have bikes and they're fine. He's got it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Actually, that was my question when it got to the seventh. But I can understand the major corridors, but I think that we still need some buy through for our districts in all in whole city. So I think we need to look at expanding the program into some of the other districts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They do not have any. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just a quick question, Mr. Beck. How many stations now are at the Olympic? Now you're really testing my memory.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe we have four different stations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have them now on campus. Ray, do you have them on campus? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And going to Councilmember Andrews earlier request, we're happy to provide information to you. We have some wonderful heatmap data that really shows the extent of the ridership of our Bikeshare program. So I'll be happy to pull together, report and share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That with you. Okay, great. And I know that we have the the, the, the system out in front of the pyramid outside of the university. But there are also the ones that we wanted inside the campus are inside the campus, correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. I'm looking at a map right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It looks like there's actually five stations on CSU above campus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect. And I just want to make sure I know we've said this separately, but just publicly, that I think it's really important that we connect and do the same thing at Long Beach City and that we connect Lombard City to Cal State, Long Beach by bicycle, and that there is a, you know, that clear route and that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'connection from the university to the college as well as PCC and that campus. I just think those hubs at the colleges, universities are really important. So thank you very much. Any public comment scene and please cast your votes and great job on this on this program.'"
