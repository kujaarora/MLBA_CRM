        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I think to all those who participated in the needs assessment and the planning efforts that have taken place over the last ten years, I'd also like to thank the Senior Advisory Commission members for their time reviewing and providing feedback and insight into this document.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The conversations were robust and provided for better for a much better document. The City of Long Beach is lucky to have many people who are truly committed to ensuring the lives of older adults are safe and productive. First, I'd like to share a little bit about our philosophy as we went into this process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the older adult population in Long Beach is very diverse and we celebrate that diversity. We seek to achieve equity and access to services and support across the city, prioritizing underserved populations to reduce disparities in social and health outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we seek to empower active, engaged, older adults to help steer the future of the course of services and programs. A few days, a few data points about older adults in our city. We have approximately 119,000 adults over the age of 50 and 43,000 over the age of 65.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Almost half of those live alone. 13% live below the poverty line, which is $11,770 for one person and just under 16,000 for two people. 40% have a disability. 25% have less than a high school education. And 24% speak English less than very well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We also have a very diverse population. And the projections indicate that our diversity, that our community will become more diverse as our diverse, younger generations age. Because of this, it's very important to ensure that the future service development take into consideration the cultures and the interests of the populations that will be serving.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're also finding over time that the poverty rate among older adults, it will be growing. So by 2025, it's projected that nearly 23% of the older adult population will live in poverty and will have less resources to support their health and well-being.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There have been a number of studies in the past, starting in 2005, the Long Beach Strategic Plan for Older Adults. In 2012, Cal State Long Beach conducted the report called Determining Needs and the Creation of a Long Beach Village for Older Adults.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'St Mary Medical Center does regular community benefit reports with research behind those. And then the Health and Human Services Department held an older adult case management summit in October of 2015. Altogether, over a thousand people have participated in and research on these assessments efforts, and they've participated through one on one interviews, focus groups, surveys and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Key informant interviews, stakeholder meetings, all different ways that they've been engaged. Depending on which study they participated in. But they found throughout all of them really is that that the issues have remained consistent. So safety, transportation, housing, health and quality of life come up through all of the reports.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And what we've found is that, you know, we continue to do the services that we provide that we'll share in a minute. But that overall, that we have not really been able to fully address the issues as they arrived due to lack of resources.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So funding has been cut across the country as well as locally in L.A. County. And so as we continue to identify needs that we haven't been able to address them due to resource issues. Another key thing that came up and that we're really focusing on here is the need for coordination through the summit and through and other'",
        "'speaker_10': 'reports really said, you know, if we could just coordinate, we have better. We have a lot going on. It's just that nobody really knows about it. And so they develop a vision, a coordinated health and social service continuum of care that effectively links older adults to the care they need when they need it to support quality of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'life. And so the more that we can take what we do have and connect early on, then we can we can have that much more impact while we are looking for additional resources. For additional services. And with that, Marie Knight will discuss the services we provide.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So there are some current services that we provide. And as you can see on the screen, those are our six senior center locations where we serve a vibrant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Important segment of our community. On average, we have over 42,000 visits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Per month to these sites by our older adults. The things that take place at these sites on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A daily basis are health and wellness programs, exercise, entertainment, social services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Socialization.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And connections and links to vital resources. In addition, over 64,000 congregate meals were served a year at these sites at four of these sites. Some of the other current services that are provided by the city and through some of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our sites are information.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And referral line. And that takes about 1200 calls a month from topics ranging from housing assistance, utility bills, transportation and linkages to disability resources. We have our Senior Links program, which is conducted by our Public Health Nurse Nurse, and that includes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Home visitations.'",

They coordinate field trips and they have worked with local nonprofits that come in and donate their services to the seniors that are meeting their.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There are services that are funded by L.A. County that are provided to our seniors here in Long Beach. And those services are funded through the federal Older Americans Act. And that includes our congregate meal programs, home delivered meals to the frail and homebound seniors.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Family caregivers support health promotion and health and wellness programs, linkages, nutrition, counseling and support services. Some of these are based on the greatest need, which they define as low income, minority limited income or geographic isolation. From the city's perspective, we provide just over $850,000 a year for those services through our Parks, Recreation and Marine Department that take'",
        "'speaker_10': 'place at our six senior center sites. We also fund $100,000 for our Senior Link's program through our Health and Human Services Fund. As I mentioned, there is funding that comes from the state through L.A. County to provide services across the county.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Unfortunately, the distribution method is one tough to nail down because those services are provided to seniors at a number of nonprofits throughout L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's difficult for us to get a good handle on just how many of our Long.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Beach seniors are being served by the funding that comes through.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the overall recommendations throughout the plan are really to implement a coordinated system of services. So really focus on developing an older adult task force, establishing a one stop adult resource network and enhancing community engagement while we continue to look for additional resources.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The older adult task force would really would be a comprehensive representation of county and city staff, community and nonprofit providers, neighborhood associations, hospitals, housing, emergency services, funders, and anyone else who is interested. It would identify common goals across existing efforts and leverage those efforts to strengthen the capacity of the city and its partners to meet the needs'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of older adults. This would be an ongoing task force really helping to drive service within the city. We also have the recommendation is an older adult and older adult research network. This would include a comprehensive resource list for older adults and their families.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There are a lot of lists. There's not a comprehensive list. And so we would be able to leverage things like the senior center information referral line that's currently used to run one scan toll free lines. They're pulling it all together in a place that was truly accessible.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then the other piece would be the this a single point of contact, such as an office of Aging within the city to coordinate services, connect providers to support successful referrals, and answer questions connecting individuals and families to the services they need.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Part of this would also be the use of technology platforms as part of the One-Stop Adult Resource Network. This would be using things such as apps organized by service type, geography and eligibility, maybe a referral system that supports what we call a warm handoff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So when someone comes in for a role, we actually referral. They actually may help support those connections, maybe GPS mapping of services and other innovative solutions. Sorry. The other piece of that is also the enhanced community engagement. And so really this was a key point which said, you know, we need to identify ways to connect families and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'community members to opportunities to support older adults within the community. And so if we're really training, engaging community members in that work, then they have a better ability to support each other.

        "'speaker_10': 'older adult task force with partner identification and outreach will take a considerable amount of staff time or other possibly maybe volunteer or paid resources to make those happen. So in the. In the Council's request. In October, we were asked to review the feasibility of an Office of Aging within the Health and Human Services Department based on the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'identified needs regarding identifying and coordinating services, outreach and technology opportunities. We developed an office description to meet these needs. We would identify and co-ordinate resources, conduct ongoing needs, assessments of community need, support community members to advocate for their needs, research and seek technology platforms, leverage existing referral systems, market services, and act as a resource clearinghouse and identify'",
        "'speaker_10': 'additional resources. The focus of this office at this time would not be providing additional direct service, but to really help coordinate what is what we're participating with and the other services. So that is we're looking for additional resources this could build on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The staffing for this would be a program coordinator. So it's four people in addition to what already exists in the services we provide. So it would leverage that our existing services. So a program coordinator to oversee the office, an additional public health nurse to really outreach to older adults and assess and connect to services.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A research analyst really doing the in-depth analysis work and looking at the needs and then really paying attention to the data as we move forward and the technology specialists to coordinate the development and maintenance of an online resource tool and a referral system.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's estimated that the creation of this office would be $493,000, which would provide the staff and technology needs to lead the effort and to address the recommendations from the plan.

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you both, Kelly and Marie for this very good report. I think my questions have been answered. It was I'm just glad to see that we're at least looking at the feasibility of an Office of Aging, because I know it has been talked about before and that, you know, specifically, we're looking to see what opportunities are available'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at the county as there are funding opportunities that we've taken advantage of. And then also going forward, I know we have another agenda item on the continuum of care that will be addressing some of that too. So that is about it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just wanted to comment that I appreciate this information and I know our commission is certainly looking into this and looking to see what other opportunities we have available. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council. Woman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I also want to thank the Health Department. I think that you and Parks and Rec put together quite a presentation. I, I look at the analysis of the funds and the allocation of customers that we currently have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that being a part of L.A. County, that the the differentiation of those groups is not really I'm focused on. And so I think that now as we're pulling away and doing our own area on area agency on Aging, that we will be able to better focus on growing some of those populations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that if the proportion of measure of the difference between the two different kinds of of meals is so striking that perhaps we don't have as strong of a partner in our home delivered meal programs, signing up and enrolling the community members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because when it comes to Thanksgiving and the other times of the year, we're out in the community delivering those meals. So we know there is a need. And then in reading through the portions of the transportation issues that the seniors are having, getting to some of the events in the congregate meals, perhaps an RFP process to onboard'",
        "'speaker_5': 'additional partners in these programs would help us leverage and draw down additional grant funding for Long Beach. So I think that this is an amazing launching point. I look forward to seeing how these numbers grow and change over the next year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As our population gets older, we can only expect for our enrollment to grow as well. And so I'm here to support, I'm here to help and thankful for the work that the commission and your staff have done. So thank you, everyone, for what you've put into this.'",

When we talk about enhancing livability in the city of Long Beach, we have to pay attention to this very, very important demographic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our older adults. Our seniors are extremely important. A number of our 119,000 residents fitting into that category is significant, and it merits further study and attention to this council to looking at creating an office of Aging or looking at putting resources or dedicating resources to make sure that we we create the best possible model to support our'",
        "'speaker_7': 'senior population. And so my my emphasis and focus will will certainly be in that area, and I look forward to continuing the conversation in the future. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you to our staff, Kelly and Marie, for the excellent presentation and the very comprehensive data. I asked this question of Kelly earlier, and I don't know if I think she was going to look into it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we know if there are pockets of older adults in various parts of the city, or do we know how they're dispersed throughout the city?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have that data. I don't have it with me right here. We have those data. The department. I'll get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, that sounds good. I'm just curious, in terms of the location of our senior centers and their proximity to where our older adult population may be. This is a very important issue, and I'm glad that we are starting these discussions, and I'm grateful for my council colleagues who originally asked for this report and brought this forward because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's important we talk a lot about youth programing and youth activities and long term sustainable programs for the youth. But sometimes we don't talk about the senior population, and that's really important. The seniors are going through a transition period where they are establishing a new type of independence and operating an environment where they may not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have the support that they need to to thrive and that they should be doing thriving. So I'm grateful that we're having this conversation. Councilman Superhot and I are also partnering together to try to bring some senior programing to the third district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have a senior center there, but we are going to transform one of our current facilities and offer on a pilot program basis some senior programing over the summer to try to engage some of the seniors who live on the east side, who may have difficulty getting to the senior center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we're excited about that. In addition to programing, though, I think the biggest obstacles that we have to address as a city are the poverty data that you have listed and how that relates to the citizens in our city that are of the older adult population who are living under the poverty line, which Kelly and I were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'discussing earlier today, is $11,000 a year or 13,000 for two people. And we have so many individuals living under that poverty line. And it's important for us to figure out some long term sustained. Strategies to help these particular individuals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I notice that in the presentation there are some next steps outlined. But what is what is the plan in terms of making some of these recommendations a reality? So is this establishing a plan for a task force, for example?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is this going to be coming back to council at some point? Where is our next data point, where we're going to check in and see where we are on these recommendations or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're taking these recommendations on the sort of the next steps is under current resourcing. And so what we would do is we could provide an update along the way about where we are in those steps and what we found from L.A. County in terms of the resourcing there and putting together the plan for the task force.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we can bring that back additional steps after that, really we'll be looking for additional resourcing. You know, often we hear where we can write a grant for that, but grants for offices and more sustainable functions aren't they're not they're not out there as much.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so we'll be trying to figure out what is our best ways to sustain this work moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because this 493,000, that would be an ongoing cost. It's not a one time cost.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'True. It's an ongoing cost.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so how would the older adult task force be different than our senior advisory commission?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The older adult task force. We envision to be made up of not only senior staff members of our advisory commission, but a lot of our service providers. So nonprofit organizations, our hospitals, potentially our churches. There are a number of providers throughout the city that have seen your services and share our mission.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so it's bringing together those stakeholders in a working task force to put forth some of these next steps, look at linkages, look at the gap analysis, help us figure out what we are offering throughout the city. But more important, where are the gaps in services and then as a task force to look at?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Are there funding opportunities? Are there opportunities for some of these partners to join together and take on maybe those extra services? So it is more of a working group of all of the providers and partners as well as community stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I think that's a really good starting point because it would take, you know, relatively speaking, to the type of resources we're talking about to create an office of Aging. I think it would take relatively minor amount of resources to get a task force established and at least start the discussions across city lines with some of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the main stakeholders, some of whom may be, you know, private entities with funding opportunities or interests and taking on the task of sustainable resource senior programing. So I think for me that's that would be a really great starting point and I'd love to hear more about how that progress is going and who who is going to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'identified as a stakeholder on that task force, because I think that's a very cost effective way to move forward with these discussions and not let them end here. Thank you. Thanks for your work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Would also like to thank Parks and Rec and the Health Department and our commission for all their work on this. It's a it's a great report. We're very excited in the fourth District because we've already started a task force on our own.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're not doing our own thing. We want we have volunteers stepping up to the plate. And it's great to have this framework in place now so we can move forward, so we can roll into the citywide effort. And the reason I think that's important is that at the end of the day, I think this is going to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'take volunteers. And I think the best way to recruit volunteers is on a council district level, and that's what we're going to endeavor to do. And Councilwoman Pryce mentioned our joint effort also, which is kind of like on the border between the third and the fourth.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I just like to say thank you again. And we really look forward to moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you. Councilmember Richard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. And I'll be brief. I just want to chime in and say that this is a this is a very solid report, although I think it's great that it's based on data over time. And I know there was an assessment in 2012 and then there's and we're doing a current assessment, a new assessment, correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Needs assessment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We will be doing. That's a part of the next part of this. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. I think this is great. Our seniors certainly count on us to make sure that we're thinking strategically and comprehensively about the services we provide to them. I'll say I'm proud that we do have Highland Park as a regional park in North Long Beach, where a number of seniors receive those services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's why it's important and great that we see both Parks and Recreation and Health Department here, because to the public, they're one and the same as it relates to service delivery. So you can continue to count on my support and fantastic work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Andrews. Yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think also I want to thank the Health Department and Parks and Rec for this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And coming forward, because the fact that the NSA, myself, I know that the importance of, you know, having a place in one.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Place where to go. And I know.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You talk about, you know, volunteers. No. One, I think volunteers more than I think is because if I could, that gives them something to do. And this is something we've got to keep them active in, because in my district, I think one of my biggest projects are working with our seniors with low income.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is a wonderful idea. And I think if you continue to live, you're going to get old. And this is a I'm a true example of that. So you guys.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Continue to do what you've been doing, and I think it's going to be a great project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Orengo.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Behind. I too want to add my voice to the well done job on this report. It's very thorough. It touches upon a lot of issues. But one of the issues that I didn't see touched upon here is that there's a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Abuse of seniors. That's done not only by maybe agencies, but by family members as well. And I don't see a position here that would provide some kind of personal assistance or a personal evaluation of older citizens who might be going through some kind of traumatic experience as they get older, that it may not be as visible as'",
        "'speaker_13': 'does it as it as you might think it would be because of the visible signs of abuse or any other kinds of trauma that that a senior citizen might go through. So I don't know if there's a plan.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I know there's a there's a position for a public health nurse. But I think that this position would probably be just a check on the staff. But I'd like to see some way that we can get a some kind of a evaluation down to the senior citizens to ensure that they are properly situated and properly taking care'",
        "'speaker_13': 'of the other type of abuse that takes place, which is maybe not talked about a lot, is the abuse that takes place when they're mismanaging their their retirement, mismanaging their Social Security or any other kinds of financing that they might get, which leads them to be in a position where they're alone or or in need of services'",
        "'speaker_13': 'that they're not taking advantage of that. So I think that there's also got to be that kind of evaluation done for the senior citizens as well. And I speak from experience. I have my my father in law passed a couple of years ago.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But near the end of his life, he yes, he made a decision on his own, on his own to get into a reverse mortgage. And that just totally devastated the it helped him in his senior years. But once he passed, then there was it was who did that property go to.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They went to the bank, or at least they tried. And it took the family quite an effort. Get an attorney, go through some hoops to get that property back and into the family so that it can be stay in the family.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So, I mean, those types of counseling services I think are very important for them as well. And they'll maybe you could incorporate that somewhere in your plan here to provide that kind of a that kind of assessment and that kind of service.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The service district is has a large number of senior housing. America Gold Star Manor, Bixby No Nos Towers Brethren Manor Vista Del Mar and Pancreas Grant and those are those are facilities that house quite a number of seniors.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I don't know how how connected they are to this or would be to this because we're talking about services to those that can't afford it, those that are that would be in these types of facilities that they get.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'These facilities are full service and they provide recreational activities. Health care and advice. But I would also like to see it as our responsibility to take care of our seniors, that we're also be able to provide that as well in terms of being able to guide them as they move into their through their senior years to make'",
        "'speaker_13': 'sure to make it as as comfortable and as livable as we possibly can make it. So. Just some food for thought in that respect, because I see this as an important issue and it's something that we need to take care of our citizens as a as a as it was said earlier, we like to expand a lot'",
        "'speaker_13': 'of our resources and energy to our youth to make sure that they have a great experience growing up. But we also need to do the same for our senior citizens. And I think that the more attention we pay to them and we give resources for them, the better off the whole community will be from the beginning to'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the end. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you very much. All right. Vice-Chair Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank. Kelly Collopy and her health department team for the attention that they continue to give our senior population. And and I appreciate and understand our concern, or at least our fiscal concern about creating an eventual office on aging.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that will be extremely expensive, especially considering that we are starting from not having even a small semblance of such an office. But I'm hopeful that this city will someday find the resources to do that. I worked in my my first opportunity outside of university was at the city of LA's Department of Aging and learned firsthand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how very critical those services were for older Americans, older adults, 55 and older. And regardless of our assumptions of how comfortable one might be in retirement because of their longevity in their careers, I think what I learned 20 plus years ago is that the ability to make ends meet on a retirement income or simply on Social Security'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is less and less possible for our folks. And so I hope we don't take our eye off that goal and find some opportunity and means to establish an office of Aging or on aging and perhaps start small. And certainly a lot of the programs that I worked on at the time were grant funded similar to the Health'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Department. I don't think that anyone could imagine that the city of Long Beach can afford to house a health department if it was fully general fund funded. But a lot of the programs, actually most of the programs are grant funded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I see the Office on Aging as a similar resource that we can house here and seek. The grant funding that's available, whether it's through Title five, the Older Americans Act and all of the other resources that Dr. Khalifi certainly knows exists.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my support is there for that, and I hope you will continue working toward it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Now, is there any public comment on this item? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Karen Reside and I also want to commend.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Health Department and the Recreation Department under the leadership of these two amazing women. They've done a fantastic job.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And nobody mentioned that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They did it in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A very short.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Turnaround time. They went to several meetings.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And were really actively engaged in bringing in the community to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Discuss the updating of this plan. One of the things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That we suffered from the plan the first time was there was never enough.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Funding. So a lot of the provisions with the plan were not put into operation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I live at seventh and Pacific in the tall senior tower, 17 stories with over 200 seniors. And I can tell you there is approximately 23 of these buildings in the general downtown area. This is where most of the low income seniors are concentrated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have residents that speak 11 different languages.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The least amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That they live on. I have one tenant that now lives on $360.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A month.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the average is about $960 a month. The only way that we can survive is by having affordable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Housing that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Funded and only charges you 30% of your income. Otherwise, many of these seniors would be out on the street. So affordable housing is really, really a key.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Component.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For our seniors. I also.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Wanted to mention that the language, 11.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Different languages.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to be respectful of the cultural differences. One of the things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That I really appreciate about the cultural diversity in our community is the attitude that other cultures have towards their seniors. They revere and respect.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Them and welcome their contributions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which isn't always the way it is in the United States. Nobody tells you how it is to become a senior. You have to learn as you go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I thank you for bringing this forward and updating the plan. This is really going to be an important issue for our community going forward in the next decade. So thank you for your attention.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'That's something that might be included as well down the line. Something that councilman you're under.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Said about being connected I think is really, really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vital.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What we don't want to be myself being a newly retired, one year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Retired senior myself. We want to stay connected.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't want to be the seniors.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We want to be part of the community because we're an integral part of the community. We have an intelligent, incredibly intelligent, educated community of seniors, and we have a lot.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'The Long.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Beach. University from the gerontology department. We had an intern there who worked with us hand in hand, and she was terrific. So the university has a huge resource, I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For us as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Integration.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the other thing.'",

She's running for president. Her opponent is 76, isn't he? The scourge of volunteerism and the expectation that keeping seniors busy is what makes our minds go blank.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Learning a new language. Learning a new skill. Having a phone to operate. This is what keeps the mind alive and well. I hope that you will reconsider that this should run on volunteerism. May I remind you that a woman 100 years ago next year at the inauguration of President Wilson had a thousand women standing at the gates'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the White House? And you know that Alice Paul paid every one of them. There was no volunteerism in the National Women's Party that won the vote. They were paid. And that's important. Volunteerism crept into our lives in the second wave of feminism, and it is choking us into poverty because people want us to do things and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'not pay us as if our work is not valuable enough to be paid. My second point is I hope that you will consider that the LGBTQ senior has a certain special problem because marriage equality did not happen until recently.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So we're not particularly abused as senior citizens by service professionals who still carry bigotry. So I hope you will consider all of these when you're talking about seniors. Keep us smart by asking us hard questions and giving us hard tasks and pass because we're worth it.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Surely start searching the Sultan's Swarm group and associates. As I listened to the outline and presentation. When we got to that point where the data was being itemized. I sat there and. Fat fought back tears. And the only reason why I will not allow them to come now is because I need to say what I need to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'say. If this office is opened before each of you, council persons draw your communities together and reignite what it means to be a resident and a citizen and part of a community, that will be a night that is a day when that office opens.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is grievous to me. We have lost what it means to be citizens. We have lost what it means to be neighbors. And if you open up an office and pay someone to do something that they won't do on their own.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I marvel at some of the coffee shops around where they train their baristas to be nice and cordial. But if you meet some of those same baristas getting out of their car in the parking lot, they won't even smile at you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's because they're being paid to do so. We have lost what it means to really care from the heart. And we'll lose it even more if you open up yet another office and pay someone to do something that they should do because there are they are an American.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You pay someone to do something because they are part of God's created human race. And somehow we've lost the capacity. To reach beyond the Federal Reserve note. And look, somebody's in the eye and say, if I see you follow me, help you get up because I am one of you.'",
        "'speaker_6': '$439,000 will not be enough to do something for people who are become more big, becoming more hardened and stagnant in their care for one another. This city does not need an office of aging. We need just people to come outside your doors, come outside, knock on somebody else's door and say, How are you doing?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I haven't seen you in a day. I haven't seen you in a week. How are you? Mr. Sloop, and I want to commend you. Commend you on getting started. I've been in your district for ten months. And God wouldn't let me leave.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Don Darren, our one of the senior commissioners. I just want to throw in a few additional comments here. I agree with the previous speaker. We need people to be a lot more friendly and outgoing. And I think senior citizens have kind of a nature to do that more so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And people say so often the younger generation has lost the ability to be. Be as courteous as is they should be taught to be. Others are very courteous and I'm so appreciative of them. But I just I thought I'd throw in a comment about how much we appreciate what Health and Human Services and our Parks and Recreation'",
        "'speaker_8': 'have done in this study. It's really great. One of the things that Councilmember Turanga mentioned is about abuse to citizens, and I think that's something that we could fold in some things with the police department, the senior partners, the police there do more visiting, and especially when it's known that there's been any sort of abuse of seniors'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I think that's a very good point that we could fall into it. Also, I want to point out transportation, for instance, all the senior citizens downtown and a lot of them have difficulty even getting to the grocery store.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'it comes from Colorado Lagoon. Not many people from there are going to Chavez Park. But the transportation problem could be solved with a circulatory route of the passport bus phrases. And right now, they don't feed seniors at the Chavez Center, but they do a lot of the other parks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We'd like to get them fed downtown, too. So those are just a couple of points I like to throw out in addition.'",

And we definitely need a bigger police department because I'm following next door and all of you on air.'",

That is that's their funding source that there hasn't really been a conversation that they would carve out or end their service here and that we would open our own area.'",

I want to first introduce to you Christopher Coons, who's our advance planning officer who has been working on this project with us for the past year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This project essentially replaces PD 29, the Long Beach Boulevard Corridor zoning, with a new specific plan and a brand new program year. It allows us to modernize the zoning and land use intentions for the Long Beach Boulevard corridor, essentially from Anaheim to the four or five freeway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a mix of single family residential uses, underperforming commercial uses, an existing medical campus at Memorial as well as Miller Children's, some public facilities. Clearly, the light rail is both a barrier and an opportunity and it suffers from quite a bit of public lack of public investment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of the existing pictures that really reflect the condition of the environment. So this is a specific plan which is very different from the more generalized zoning. It is much more detailed and provides a lot more guiding vision and details on what our expectations are.'",

This is our first specific plan in Long Beach. The downtown plan is a quasi specific plan, but it will be more like the downtown plan than any of our existing zoning documents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the specific plan boundaries will essentially mimic the PD 29 corridor. Again, it focuses on land uses along the light rail and it's big issues are stimulating new investment, reducing auto dependent dependency, improving pedestrian and bike safety, promoting sustainable building and active living, streamlining the development approvals for future projects and leveraging existing medical uses to create additional'",
        "'speaker_5': 'employment opportunities. What this specific plan really does is it focuses our major development areas along those nodes where the Metro Blue Line is and where we want to see mixed use projects with additional density there. So we'd like to get away from the single story strip center commercial uses and focus more on the mixed use developments that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'you've seen sporadically over the last few years. This did require us to circulate a program earlier, and the program earlier does require you to adopt a statement of overriding considerations. There are three categories where we've done the environmental review under Sequa and have determined that we cannot mitigate to a level less than significant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And those are in the area of air quality greenhouse gas emissions and noise, although noise is temporary during construction activities. Because of that, we do ask that you make findings that the adoption of this plan is far more beneficial than any potential impacts that could be caused by future development activities.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm just going to have you cover one more thing. I think it's the most interesting part. I know this isn't always the sexiest item, but this planning stuff is great. If you can just cover the land use districts real quick and then mature and over to Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Certainly we do have we have decided I shouldn't say we decided we have created five different land use districts in this plan. The nodes are fairly self-explanatory and that they are where the blue line intersects with the major cross streets of Anaheim, PCH, Willow and Wardlow.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also have the medical campus, which is around the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in Miller Children's Family. We also have the Open Space District, which will include Veterans Park and then any other open space assets that we're able to develop.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So I, I was looking through this and I noticed minor auto repair. And so what would that be defined as? Because we do have an inundation of auto repair along Long Beach Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So minor auto repair would be a break, break replacement or window shield replacement, things like that. It would be not engines, transmissions, auto body work. Those are considered major auto body.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, perfect. I also saw in there amusement machines with those be like slot machine type.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're like arcade pinball, the old pinball machines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was like, I don't know what that is, but I'll, I'll ask you anything. And then massage therapy, I believe, is is that does that have to go through a a process before or is it. I was no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So massage if it is related to an existing use like a salon, I believe it is considered approved. And then there's also been recent court cases, I believe Mr. City Attorney on the use of massage where we don't have the ability to regulate them like we used to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, to which type of massage?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A standalone massage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Okay. Okay, great. And then drive thrus. I didn't notice them in here, but I wanted to ask about that as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If they're not in here, in, Christopher will look it up quickly. For me, we do require copies for drive thrus under Title 21, so we were either more restrictive in here or we referred to Title 21.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we actually prohibit drive thrus outright in PD, excuse me, in the new specific plan. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And then I would just say I'm glad that we're looking at Metro as kind of the core to this area, especially when it comes to upgrades for ADA compliance as well as just safety. And hopefully I know we've talked in the past about with Metro and the county about turnstiles being added and I don't know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if that's still a conversation that is alive, but it would be great to continue that because, you know, we're just getting an influx of issues that arise from from the metro and and people coming in and out without paying.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. Understood. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, great. And then I think that is about it. But I just want to thank you. I think adding more safety, certainly more ADA compliance, lighting, all of that, and ensuring that we're getting the right businesses in is really important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I really appreciate it and thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We're going to go and go to a vote. I just wanted to just add a couple comments, and that is that I believe that this is the first I planned planning major planning document that we've done since the downtown plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that correct, Ms.. Potok?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, sir, that is correct. And it is our first specific plan in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just don't want to. Yeah, I know it's easy to to to gloss over, but these plans take an incredible amount of work. I mean, they're multi-year planning documents. The staff works incredibly hard on these plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The community works incredibly hard on these plans. There's numerous outreach meetings that have happened and that have happened all throughout the Long Beach Boulevard corridor in both district districts one and District six. And so I just want to thank the staff for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I also these these planning documents guide the future of development for an entire area. The downtown plan had a huge impact on the development of downtown enormous overnight. I mean, the the Molina project was completely done because of the downtown plan from from one day to the next.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the changes that are in this plan, the kind of the focus on livability and the on transit and the housing nodes, I all think bode very well for the future of Long Beach Boulevard. Staff hears me complain about one beach boulevard all the time as it weekly pad.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Weekly. It's weekly. It's the main it's it's one of the main entry points from Los Angeles, people that come in and out of the train as a regular writer of the train. I want those folks coming into our city to have a good experience all the way down on Beach Boulevard.'",

So we had some plan goals here to increase equity in terms of investing in pedestrian improvements throughout the area, providing alternative transportation.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We stopped people on their way to and from the blue line and asked them what their issues were and how they traversed the neighborhoods surrounding these metro stations. Through that, we got an incredible amount of information and called that into 33 recommended projects, 13 of which are high priority.'",

So there is an idea here that's percolating that we can change the manner in the street because it does not have a lot of vehicular traffic and provide green space and open space to the neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_5': ', but still keep transit moving. This is an example of a street lit concept on Long Beach Boulevard, where you essentially close the end of a T street and create either temporary or permanent greenspace for the neighborhood. We also looked heavily at the greenbelt along Del Mar near the Wardlow station.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think everyone who's visited there knows that it's extremely difficult for the pedestrian to access the Wardlow station. Once they do find a parking space somewhere on the street. So all of these and these are part of our 13 high priority projects that rolled up into the three projects identified in this study.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We think that these equate to about $70 million in potential projects and that they could be implemented over time. And we're certainly using this plan to go after additional funding sources from Metro and Caltrans and then also the FTA.'",

Is helpful for many reasons, but I think we are nationally at least having a dialog about whether it's the right term to use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so one of the things that we hope to look at as this analysis comes back is to reframe those instances as truly just collisions and not to assign blame, but to really assign the severity of it, especially to pedestrians and those on bike, those on really on on smaller mobility devices.'",

But I think it's important that this plan and I think it's good that this plan is based on data and helps us to identify funding strategies based on data.

I can tell you firsthand that we've had about seven community watch meetings in the First District alone, and each meeting was attended by our police'",
        "'speaker_4': 'department, but as well as our health department, who really educated our downtown communities or West Side communities and central Long Beach communities about their work every single day in what we're doing to outreach to these populations, which I think is so very important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this agenda item was just an informational to receive a report back related to different components that we've been hearing, not just from First District residents, but citywide. It touches on mental health services and the funds allocated substance abuse prevention services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As I think, you know, we're doing a lot of work, but I think there's certainly more we can we can do. I know we're very limited in funding, but I think in speaking with both Susan and Kelly, I know that there's a lot of work that they're doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in addition, homeless children and families. I did notice in a 24 report that there was a line item for families. And I notice in the reports now that I don't see that. So I wanted to actually ask about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in addition to the grant funding, what we're doing is specific to receiving funds from the county, which I know we've received recently, last year and so forth. And so I'll turn it over to you and the Health Department, to each of you, if there's anything you wanted to add.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, I know we're asking for this report to come back later, but if there's any just preliminary updates you'd like to add. And then also my question related to the families section.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to Councilmember Gonzales for bringing this item forward. We're not new to this issue, of course, but we are seeing it in all of our districts now, not just the downtown or uptown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have many constituents that have week after week during council meetings, raised concerns about the issue. I appreciate that it is very time and resource intensive as it relates to various city departments and the IT being. How do we address this issue?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's easy to say that it's just a health department issue or just a police issue when in actuality it's our entire city that needs to address this. So thank you to the staff that we have had for many years, especially Susan Price, who's worked on this with her heart and soul and spent her career here at the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city doing her best and putting our best foot forward and reminding everyone that we are a city of great compassion. So thank you for your efforts. And as you go into looking at how we could better serve the homeless, I appreciate that the work that you'll be putting into it going forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Sorry, I had asked a question before. No, that's okay. No, no, it's all right. I just wanted to make sure I got that answered first, so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, that's okay. That's all right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. We do have some answers from the questions that Suzanne will provide. A short report and then answer those questions will be coming back to you with a longer, more detailed report around the rest of the data.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'm confused.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Which confused him.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know what? We're going to do another price. Why don't why don't we do page 20 of the staff report on this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely. We have our entire homeless contingent from the Health and Human Services Department, our director, Kelly Colby, bureau manager Suzanne Price for her last meeting and also Teresa Chandler. So Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All right, Susan Will. We'll start by answering some of the questions for which we have the data available, and then we will complete the rest of the report when we come back to Council on the Future. Honorable mayor and city council members.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just a very brief report on some of the information that's being requested. We do a biannual homeless count every two years, and our next one is coming up on January 26, 2017. We are accepting volunteers as we speak for that homeless count and will have some very robust information to update from our prior count that was listed'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in this item. Additionally, I want to mention that the Homeless Services Division comprises about a $10 million annual budget, primarily with the continuum of care, the emergency shelter grant dollars, and also some county funds, regional funds that we receive for homeless veterans.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Our portfolio currently in the continuum of care, is about 28.8% in mental health services for both individuals and families in the city of Long Beach. That is about a $2 million annual contribution from the continuum of care. And then for families and children, that equates to about 14%, about $1 million in our annual continuum of care application'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is for families with children in Long Beach that are currently experiencing homelessness. And I know that there are other requests being asked here in for the detailed report that will be coming forward. We can outline a bit more of that in our inter-departmental collaborative work with the police department and other city departments on the issue of homelessness'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Okay. Thank you very much. Let me I have some council comments first. I've got three those Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you to the Health Department and Susan and your team for the excellent work that you have done. I had an opportunity to have a briefing with Kelly today, so we've talked a little bit about some of these issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that I've talked with Susan in the past about homeless issues and coming up with out of the box solutions that we can try. Even on a pilot basis in parts of the city, one of the things that I've noticed and I had the opportunity to go on a ride along with Long Beach PD two'",
        "'speaker_4': 'weeks ago, East Division Officer Dodson took me out and I had an opportunity to work with your homeless outreach team that reported, and I was just so incredibly impressed by the approach that they take when they approach these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If it's a veteran, the specific veterans team goes out. If it's someone with mental illness, the mental illness specialists go out. But the problem that I saw that is of major concern to me is a large number of the people that we saw and we contacted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Officer Dodson was great. We we approached these people with Officer Dodson, and it was honestly, it was life changing to be able to be up close and personal and do it with him. But a number of these people have substance abuse problems.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you don't want me to get on my Prop 47 train, but I think we're starting to see more and more of that, at least where I work every day. We're starting to see more and more people addicted to drugs, and that may lead to mental illness.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what we're seeing is people who are choosing to not accept the services that we have. So you should be commended for the amazing services and resources that we offer. But the problem, in my opinion, is what do you do about the people who don't want the services?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What what is our plan? What's our solution? What are we going to be doing long term for those individuals? Because more and more people are choosing to be homeless. And the idea of getting treatment is not something that says enticing for them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Above and beyond that, however, we don't really have any treatment options available for them, so we really have nothing to give them, even if they wanted to participate in some sort of a long term treatment plan, nothing that's affordable that they can that we can get funding for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's an area where I hope once we get the data, we can kind of focus and see what are other cities doing. What kind of support can we get from the county to try to fund some substance abuse type programs?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We I can't tell you how many bike chop shops we saw while we were out there. In fact, I was looking for my own bike. If anyone sees a red cruiser with Hawaiian flowers on it, that belongs to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there were some very high quality, you know, bike parts all over the place and along with hypodermic needles and all sorts of things that go along with the drug addicts on the streets, lifestyle, incredibly sad. A lot of young people out there who have so much potential, I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, you know, we I've expressed to Susan in the past that we want to be as involved as we can be, as the department will allow us to be, and trying to help find solutions and and even implement some of them in the third district to see what works.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to thank you for your work. Susan is on vacation. She came in special tonight. So I thought that in order to make her trip worthwhile, I would share with her. I'm not sure if she knows, but the Grunion Gazette today had a cover story about Susan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm going to read the story because ever since she was named the homeless czar, I've received nothing but emails from people in Orange County asking me if I'm leaving the DA's office to become the homeless czar because Susan and I share a name identity theft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the news flash from the grunion today. I was tired of being, quote, just another Susan Price. The original Susan Price leaves Long Beach to be a czar. In a surprising turn of events, the County of Orange recently announced that it would be stealing one of the city of long beaches, top employees Susan Price, in order to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'entice her to leave the more superior local government entity. Orange County Supervisors apparently gave Price the title of homeless czar. When asked what she thought about the move, Price said, How can you pass up a job with the czar in the title?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The move comes as a big surprise to the other Susan Price, who serves as a councilwoman in Long Beach and goes by the nickname Susie Price. When asked what she thought about the move, Councilman Price said Maybe now people in Long Beach won't confuse our email addresses, according to the councilwoman over the past 18 months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many emails intended for her went to Susan Price instead. Councilwoman Price qualified any inappropriate response a resident may have received from her as being from Susan Price, she said. If you received an email response to the effective, that sounds like a First World problem or seriously, are you kidding me with that complaint?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was likely from Susan, not Susie Price. In an unrelated development, we have learned that Susie Price was recently fired from her job and in Orange County. Apparently she went to her boss and demanded that she be called the prosecution czar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tony Rackauckas was not amused. In other news, Orange County officials were caught on tape asking how they can be more like Long Beach. The new homeless czar of Orange County was late to work on her first day because all the buildings in Orange County look the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Real Housewives of Orange County want the homeless czar to get a makeover so she can fit in. In The O.C., Councilwoman Price is going to be sponsoring an agenda item forbidding the hiring of anyone named Susan Price, citing email confusion as the primary reason.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Councilman Price tells the homeless czar that she better get used to the title. The other Susan Price, now that she's coming to O.C. because karma is a you know what? So we wish you the best of luck.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're looking forward to having you. Well, I'm looking forward to having you in O.C., because we'll be working across the street practically from one another, so we'll be able to meet one another. Where the homeless are currently congregating between your office and mine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The tent city. That's where we can meet and have lunch together every once in a while. So congratulations on your new position, and thank you for everything you've done for us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, sister. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm so glad to be able to be working with Susan Thursday night with the name of the czar. Maybe we can really solve a lot of problems. That's accessory. But I'm committed, my colleagues on this item because it's a great compassion, you know, for our residents who have become homeless or as'",
        "'speaker_12': 'homeless. You know, and I would like to ask you as a friendly if that's okay with council, I mean, you know, to include the report, what is step to, you know, the city of Long Beach and has taken a recommendation to implement from October four, you know, 2004, there was a ten year strategy in homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if she would like that, I don't know what she's made her, you know, a motion yet, but if you like, I like to use as a friendly. Yes. You know, I'd like to have a recommend it. Take the recommendation and implement from the Oct 204 ten year, you know, ready to end homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So what are the steps in the city of Long Beach that's been taken? What steps have been taken by the recommendation implemented from October 2004? What steps has been taken?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just. Yeah, just taking that information. Yes, that's kind of combining the two. Sure. We can do that if.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That would be fine with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman, you Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mary. And I want to add my voice and congratulations to Susan Price, not Susie and her appointment to Orange County. I had the honor of working with Susan for a number of years when I was at the Health Department, and we worked a lot on some of these issues that she had.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But aside from that, I have some questions, obviously. My district runs by well, a river runs through it. As I always like to say, the L.A. River and the L.A. River is a hotbed of homelessness. It appears there are always there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And it seems like every time that there is a sweep or a cleanup, they're back almost, almost immediately. So maybe you can help me understand the the partnership that the city has with the county of Los Angeles and Caltrans and what they do for outreach and environmental cleanups as it relates to the river and to the flood'",
        "'speaker_13': 'control and other areas that are highly appealable. Appeal appealable to the homeless to have their encampments. Is there. And let me explain. I guess I should explain what I want here. Every time that I get a complaint from a resident or a constituent relate regarding the homeless encampment along the river or along the freeway, we have to'",
        "'speaker_13': 'go through some hoops to get them out. So maybe you can can you explain for my purpose, as well as the constituents who are out there in terms of what the process is that we have to go through in order to get such encampments out of the way, out of sight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're looking for that in the future. REPORTER Are you looking for a response now?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, if you're not right now, obviously, yes. But if not, then I would have to wait to the report. That's fine. That's ready tonight. That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have a, you know, the current efforts.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Council member Urunga Ah ah. Inter-departmental collaboration extends to a regional collaboration with the LA County Public Works Flood Control District, as well as Caltrans and a number of other. There's railroad land and a number of other areas along the L.A. River corridor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Health Department and the police department work collaborative collaboratively with these jurisdictional land authorities because the police department and the health department are basically managing the entire city of Long Beach jurisdiction, even though those land management areas may change.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so, you know, there's been a lot of collaboration over the years with that. And L.A. County has become very diligent in doing very frequent maintenance operations along the flood control. It is a infrastructure item, not necessarily a place safe for human habitation, as we all know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so our outreach teams are out there very regular, regularly monitoring. You know, the things that belong to the city of Long Beach primarily are the bridges, but the rest of the flood control is L.A. County jurisdiction. And so we we work hand-in-hand with them on addressing those issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, historically, there were anywhere upwards of 400 people along the L.A. River from Queensway Bay Bridge all the way up to Artesia. It hasn't been like that in a number of years, but we're starting to see an increase along the L.A. River corridor, as well as the increase, you know, that we're dealing with citywide.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah. And that's and that's my concern is that there seems to be a much more emboldened, if you will, homeless community that is making those encampments there. I mean, there's an encampment right off of a will. And and and the and the river the freeway right there where it's just like taking over a whole spa.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Looks like a mansion. But and I know that we've had a couple of cleanups in that in that area. However, it seems like they come back almost the next day. Is there any kind of follow up? Is there is there follow up from the police department or the other agencies?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'When we clean out, we have a sweep or whatever, clean up, clean out of that area. Is there any follow up immediately? Like to make sure that they don't come back? It appears like from from one day to the next they're just back at it again.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Is there is there some kind of follow up that we have on it?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Council member. I think that, you know, we have struggled with resource from both the street outreach perspective as well as our work with the police department on managing the various hotspot locations that we have throughout the city, as well as the two river corridors that we maintain, the San Gabriel and the L.A. River.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So when you say resources, you're talking about manpower, wind power. People power.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'People power.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'All right. Well, it's a little frustrating for me, obviously, because I'm getting these I mean, almost on a daily basis, I'm getting a complaint of an encampment right at the exit, individuals who are unkempt and very highly visible to the public, and it's just unsightly.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I wish that once this report is done that we can also come back with some solutions as to how we can make it more lasting. And I know that what happens on many occasions is that when we might.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Have a sweep or a cleanup and they end up going into the neighborhoods. So we need some more real, lasting solutions to this issue because they're not going away. In fact, we're finding that they're increasing. So we need to find more solutions to this situation that be reactive by being proactive.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council member Supernanny.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Regarding the Grunion article, I noticed the date on that was May 22nd and I believe the Go Forth Friday newsletter scooped the grunion there. Apologies to Harry Salts gave her, but we ran an article titled Susan Price not Susie headed to Orange County and we covered her fell farewell party.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And Susan, you mentioned me in your farewell address and thank you for that. And that was very humbling. And I appreciate that. I would. You had a quote on on Thursday night, Susan, and it was about I'll put you on the spot here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's about the 1% factor. And I just want to commend you for how much your department has done that. If we go by the statistics, the homeless population in Long Beach should be much larger than it actually is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And due to your diligence and your great work, it's a fraction of the size. Is it actually, which I'd like you to kind of elaborate on that formula and how you work that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Council member super. And I was referring to the 1% of any city's population that the national statistic would be homeless. And within the city of Long Beach, being a city of half a million people, that should be around 5000 people.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But in our 2015 homeless count, which I have right here, it's 2345. And I really attribute that to a perfect storm that started in 1987 with the Task Force on Homelessness that had a vision to create a coordinated entry point, which in 1999 it realized in the Multi-Service Center over on the west side of the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The other part of that perfect storm was that the Base Realignment and Closure Act that created the 26 acre villages at Cabrillo, which the original conveyance was somewhere around 860 people that would be housed in affordable housing to date were up around 1300, I believe, with some additional phases of development, housing and affordability over there at the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'villages at Cabrillo. So, you know, this is a this is a model system of care. I've been very fortunate to be a part of it all of these years, but ultimately it works very well. And it is an interdepartmental collaboration between all the different departments to try to mitigate street homelessness as well as address service, service needs'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and housing needs of our populations. So every department has been involved in that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you for that explanation. And I think we know that we're going to stay after this. We're going to work very hard on the issues. My counsel there certainly has my first year in office, but I just wanted to commend you at this time for the great work in the past.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to just first acknowledge our health department, and particularly Susan Price, who's done a fantastic job within this space. I've had the chance to work with her on the Windows Winter Shelter for a number of years, and it's been a great experience.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the residents have really, you know, have they're comfortable with our winter shelter. So I want to start off by just acknowledging her. I want to I want to just mention. I don't think it makes as much sense for me to point out the small new nuances.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we have some major issues that we have to think big about, and I'm hoping that this is an opportunity to talk about them. So, one, we need a long term plan for winter shelter. So there's not an emergency every year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've talked about that, but that's something that I hope can be addressed in this report. We need to talk about the expansion of shelters in general within our city. I think with within the conversation about the L.A. River restoration, the I 17 corridor project in the 1991 freeway modernization, I think now is an important time to start'",
        "'speaker_11': 'thinking about how our interests, how those projects can align to fix what I believe is one of the one of the unsafe is freeway intersections with hundreds of people living living under that freeway intersection when I'm talking about the 1791.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if anyone goes down down in that area, there are literally hundreds of tents that you can only see on unless you cannot see from the public. Residents cannot see it. But if you take one or two of the on ramps or off ramps, you can see it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the fact is, it's there. It's unsafe. It's not. It's within the city of Long Beach, but not on our agency. It's going to be very difficult to to fix this. But this is one of the worst interchanges in Southern California with some of the the most difficult homeless issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I hope that we have an opportunity to really think big and talk about leveraging these large scale projects to finally talk about this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Carlton Boston.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you. And I want to express my congratulations to Susan Price for her, her role now in Orange County as designer of homelessness. Thank you for your great service to the city of Long Beach. You've been great to work with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez for allowing me to sign on to this. This item, obviously, I think homeless. This is becoming fast becoming the most serious issue facing our city on many levels, I think. I'm glad we're talking about this because we do have a more responsibility to address this issue and take on the challenge'",
        "'speaker_7': '. I don't think we have much of a choice. It's our burden to share together. And leadership and governance is not easy. We're going to have to make tough decisions and lead on these issues. I think to effectively address this is going to require, and I'd like to use the basketball analogy is going to require a full court'",
        "'speaker_7': 'press from this entire city. From all departments, and we should also be prepared to commit more resources locally to deal with the problem. It's a complicated issue because it mostly deals with adults with substance abuse problems and as I mentioned, mental illness, poverty and the numbers are good here in the city of Long Beach, I guess if'",
        "'speaker_7': 'you look at the national trend, but they're still not acceptable and they are increasing. We specifically I get complaints in and I think we all get complaints from constituents about this issue. And most of the time, constituents are not complaining about the homeless.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They want to do something more to help. Right. We have and Rex mentioned the L.A. River councilmember. You want to mention the L.A. River? We are having we are about to go into construction along with the forest wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we know that hundreds of homeless live in that area. We need a plan to deal with that once we start construction. They're living under our freeways. We just recently did a river cleanup with the friends of the L.A. River.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I was pretty, pretty it was pretty eye opening to go underneath the freeway underpass and see how people were living and the sheer numbers of people living under one little freeway underpass, our alleys, along our business corridors and oftentimes behind our residents, the homeless are saying no camps, our city parks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And most recently in I got a call at about 7:00 in the morning, just about a week ago with somebody set up right in broad daylight on Atlantic Avenue and 46th Street in Bixby Knolls on the sidewalk. I think the homeless are crying out and seeking attention, and we we have to respond.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of the 2300 homeless that we have, I think the staff report says that 1500 are unsheltered. I had a question for staff. How many? What is our capacity right now to provide shelter to the homeless with that? So I understand somewhere around we have 832 sheltered individuals, according to the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are we at capacity there?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Somewhat of a more complicated question because the homeless count report only reflects beds that are designated for homeless persons. However, in on any given day in the city of Long Beach, there could be 1500 people sheltered in in programs like drug and alcohol programs that are not specifically designated for homeless population specifically.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This report is a HUD report. So it's only those that are like homeless emergency shelter, homeless transitional programs. There's a number of other programs where people are referred and where people are sheltered or staying in transitional awaiting permanent housing placements.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So in answer to your question is probably more like 1500.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Sheltered, sheltered emergency and transitional.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you so much. And I guess I don't expect an answer tonight. Oh, I did have one other question. In terms of the work that we do as a city. How many outreach workers do we actually have to go out and provide services and do outreach to to the homeless in our city?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city of Long Beach employs three street outreach workers, but the Street Outreach Network is relatively robust. How many would you say? About 20 different hours.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Join the outreach network and that consist of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure the outreach network is basically all of the agencies that are funded in the continuum of care and it includes veteran outreach workers, mental health outreach workers. Let's see, there are help me out. De Alba, the quality of life unit with the police department.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The three staff that we have, we're the Gateway Cities COG folks. I mentioned Mental Health America.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I'd like to know more about that. Our capacity to do that and what exactly the mission is when we when we're doing outreach. And again, that can come back. I would like to add a friendly of Councilmember Gonzalez that that we received some sort of recommendation from staff to improve our capacity to house homeless both in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'transitional and permanent housing. If you're open to that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are you suggesting options that they come back with or choosing? Yes. That sounds good.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. It's on the side. Okay. Sorry goes on. Thanks, Mr. Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I know that this item that was authored by Councilwoman Gonzales is asking for the state of our homelessness and the state of the services that we provide. But I think I know Councilwoman Gonzales well enough to know that it's really to lay the framework for the larger conversation that I know she and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'others on this council would like to have when this report comes back. I will not be on this council. And I wanted to just share some thoughts about this larger conversation. Some of my colleagues have alluded to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think our staff has alluded to it. But when we look at cities, communities and states that address the very same issues that we're discussing tonight, we see that there is perhaps a conceptual shift that's taking place for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We assume that you would have to deal with the issues that homeless residents. Present themselves with, such as drug addiction, abuse, mental illness, all the things that we are aware of, we talk about and I know that our staff struggle with to help address.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm looking at my. Friends and colleagues from the domestic violence community who know very well how it is when a victim presents herself or himself and has multiple diagnosis. And how do you approach that? And perhaps what we've been doing for far too long as a city and a community and a society is overcomplicating, adding tremendous'",
        "'speaker_2': 'amount of complexity to something that's quite basic, which is a fundamental need, and that's housing. And so. If we could in the larger conversation that you will all have and I will watch from home or here and be inspired by.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I can hope that you would have the conversation about just how do we come forward as a city that places Housing First? And I know we're doing a pilot project to Mr. City managers that at The Villages.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So it's a housing first approach, which is housing. No questions asked. No conditions, no strings attached. So when you look at Central Florida and you look at the state of Utah, which I know many of us may not expect progressive actions to come out of the state of Utah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I. I beg to differ. I beg to differ. If you look at their approach to homelessness, it's quite progressive. The state legislature has funded. Housing for homeless individuals without strings attached. And that conceptual shift is called Housing First.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I would like to see our city move in that direction, which is do not put these conditions that you must be clean and sober and you must be this and you must be that in order for us to provide housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is a very, very, very strict and and somewhat conservative but misguided approach, because if we are concerned about our residents and housing our residents, we shouldn't attach all these conditions to it. If we want to ask ourselves, why are people settling into settlements along freeway embankments in places that we just know are so dangerous?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have to look at ourselves and see what conditions perhaps we may be placing, what requirements that we may place. Our staff our staff does a tremendous job. And I'm very. I'm I'm I'm glad that we are less than the 1%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Gonzales reminded me that when we do our homeless count, those are the folks that we can count. So I'm not sure if if there is a better way to get an exact count, but however we reduce it is always a success.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if I can urge my colleagues to look at how we approach solving homelessness. Understanding the state of homelessness. Understanding the resources that we have and that we are currently applying. But what are the guidelines? What is the guiding principles that this council is going to give its staff when it comes to addressing homelessness?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If just like Vision Zero, we are working toward zero collisions that you have to have a guiding principle. So I hope we can be bold enough to say to our staff, housing first. And then let the professionals address the other issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if we are about getting our people off our streets, let's not tie any strings to them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just wanted to thank everyone for their thoughtful comments. I know this is a very large subject, and I wanted to touch on a few things that I think were very important to many of our residents. And I also wanted to include in here a time frame as to when we can come back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll request that this information come back within 90 days and then we can go forward from there. But I thank my colleagues for this information.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mayor Councilmembers This is such a large topic. I don't think there's any way we can come back in 90 days. I'm going to talk to Kelly for a suggest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What would be realistic?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Theresa Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Six months. We were going through the continuum of care application. We were planning for a homeless count and we've lost our bureau manager. So if you could give us six months, I would appreciate that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Six months is fine. But if we can, you know, I understand with this, you know, everything, considering we'll.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Come back.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It will come back at 90 days or 90 day increments with updates. So you'll see an update.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That we're happy with. Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is timely and I just want to make sure that we're on track and we don't get it, you know, another year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And no, we think we can bring you data, the specific data that you requested in a report in terms of the additional planning conversations that have been going, we'll need longer time to to spend more time planning for those and to present those in a report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would be great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Public comment on this item. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. My name is Joanna Ferraro. I am a resident of downtown, so I pay a mortgage. I also own a small business and I do not get a paycheck to work with our people experiencing homelessness in our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No one is paying me. I've had a father die as a homeless man and I've been in the trenches over ten years. So where I'm coming from is I need to see downtown Long Beach thrive because I'm invested 100%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And number two, I have some personal experience with this. And number three, I was told when I came to Long Beach, I went to a meeting which you were at and listen to a lot of people complain about the homelessness issue here in downtown or in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I asked one simple question when I really demanded the mic and I said, you know, thank you for all you do. And I still continue to say that because a lot of people cannot do what you do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They can't. It takes very thick skin. So thank you for what you're doing. But what is it that we can do to help? And since then, that's been over a year and I've done nothing but research. I've been working with every program with Alice and Crip, Steve at Dolby, Dolby to Beacon for him, villages.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'MH And done ride alongs with our quality of life officers. I've been doing nothing but research on my own because this is something I care very much about. And I again, I don't get paid to do this. But I will say this the one thing I'm learning, I had to write in my hand because I have to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'do that and get my notes on. The one thing I learned is that community education is key. And even hearing what you guys said, there's myths and actual sentences. US council members said right now, which tells me we need to educate you first and foremost, because I just heard you guys say myths not to put anyone on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'blast, but I was like, Oh my gosh, they don't know. They think they don't know the information. They need to know that. And I literally put together 40 a 45 minute PowerPoint, and it's the nine collaborative truths. And what it is, is is every single entity that is working in the trenches.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Have said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To me over and over again, It's not jio's words. It is their words. They are the ones getting their hands dirty every day. So what is it? They agree that our community, our leaders need to know? What is it that we need to educate because they need more cheerleaders?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because when they have a title, they're going to get some people listening to them and some go at your views.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A little skewed because you work for the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I didn't do that. I got my hands dirty and figured out what those truths are. Those truths need to be spread and educated. We need to understand our outreach workers and respect what they do and really listen to them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to fill the gap. The gap is that we aren't getting people accepting our services because there's a gap and we need to understand how to get that gap, dissipate that gap. We need to use preventative aspects to my time's going to run out on me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Preventative. No one wants to talk about the preventatives of homelessness. Where's our economy at? Where's minimum wage? Where are jobs at? No one's talked about that part. There's a preventative way to homelessness, too, right. We've got to look at those other things in our in our society.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Last but not least, we need to involve our community leaders like me and Alice and Chris, who do this for no paycheck but care that much about this downtown in our community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you to you. Excellent. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Sharon we with Interval House. And tonight I'm also here as co-chair for the Long Beach Continuum of Care for the Homeless and on behalf of the 20 diverse and very passionate agencies working and aiming to end homelessness in our community, we are excited to be come back also to help with whatever information the city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is going to provide. But we wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to our housing leader, Susan Price. And Susan has been a visionary and she has guided our collective efforts and she has helped shape Long Beach to be a model of the United States in solving and ending the issue of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's something that we're very, very proud of. We know there's more work to be done, but it's something that HUD, seeing what has been so effective and successful here, is now encouraging communities across our nation to create a collective, coordinated system like the one we started here at the Multi-Service Center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's something that we as a community should feel proud of at Interval House. We also serve victims. We serve victims of domestic violence, primarily so many that end up homeless because they are fleeing life threatening violence in their own homes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Susan and the city has helped us expand very critical housing programs that have literally saved lives. And for that, we're also very thankful to you. We have, under Susan's leadership, really created something that has been decreasing the numbers of homelessness in our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we are seeing an end to veteran homelessness. That's something that we haven't really talked about tonight, but that's something that is something that has been a collective effort and something that is real. And we only hope to continue that work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we want to thank you, Susan, for taking us along your journey and being a part of that and for fighting for the homeless people and for changing lives in a way that no one else could. And we have a lot more work to be done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Just mentioned a few minutes ago, but to also personally say, I don't think we're personally all going to hear and end homelessness. I think what we're going to need to focus here.'",

Homeless people were heading that off and pursuant to the fruit, if we can get their approval and I think we will be getting that from the Secretary of Veteran Affairs.

And in between that eight end structure and the there's a a storage area there for both people that have the water ski and towboats and so forth. What I am going to suggest is that what we will do is get, I believe, either eight or excuse me, 12 to 16 Airstream type'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And what prompted that idea was, one, I had been focusing in on that specific area, as mentioned last week or for a few weeks before. But then then the last couple of days, again, which I think many people saw, I have seen on TV, the Expos, the TV chronicling the programs, chronicling what Prince Harry has been doing'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with his combat veterans, so forth, and it just all merged into one. So I think that's a great location. It is only a five minute walk to two bus stops, which we would put into any place, and particularly the VA.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'It will not be an open public restroom, but I think it's a serene setting. If you haven't, if you're not familiar with the area, go down there, look for eight end and then walk north on that green grass and that stretch.'",
