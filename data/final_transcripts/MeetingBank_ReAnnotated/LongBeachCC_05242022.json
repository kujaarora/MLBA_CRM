        "'speaker_3': 'Everybody's dealing with it. Commodities going up significantly. Forks are the bane of my life right now. At four different forks in my restaurant. I only want one, but you've got to go on the open market when your vendors can't get them, and quite often you're paying double and triple the price.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'People still want to sit outside. So that's I would tell you that most our patios fill up first, whether it's an actual parklet or your actual patio, that's even when the weather's not great. So there's still a demand for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'State of California is still in an emergency situation, so that shouldn't really change. A lot of you guys have been super supportive of having Parklets, which we greatly appreciate. If you didn't have that feeling, a lot of restaurants would go out of business.'",

What we're asking for is the opportunity to help improve some of that and that we can work together with the city in order to'",

        "'speaker_3': '. You are here in a moment of time. Try striving to make the best decisions on behalf of your residents and the city as a whole. But none of you were in these roles when the Parklets issue first arose almost a decade ago.'",

The concerns are even exasperated, especially in Belmont, Shaw and the pier areas. You have before you a detailed presentation encompassing many of the facets that our group has gathered over time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to spotlight just a few of those for you tonight. During COVID, the need for a lifeline for businesses was very clear and supported by everyone. It's been two years plus and that time has passed. Not one restaurant or bar in Belmont Shaw has closed due to the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Historically, you should be aware of that. Georges Greek Cafe in 2012 applied for and sought a parklet. At the time they were denied flatly, citing parking concerns, loss of meter revenue, safety concerns, walkability along the shore. Similarly, on that same front, many business owners at the time even weighed in, quote, You're taking a public space and making'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it private. That was a business owner on Second Street at the time. Quote, I would never want to take parking spaces away. I can just not imagine carrying food across the sidewalk of a restaurant owner. I don't see it because of safety concerns, movement of traffic and even a greater sense of parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Curt Schneider, business owner of multiple properties on Second Street. In 2010, the Belmont Shore Athletic Club was denied a simple parklet like space to put a bike rack. Similar similar needs were cited for that. The unique geography, the unique character of Belmont Shore and the Pier makes it a unique area that is not possible to sustain parklets'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on a permanent basis in any form. The congestion, the geography mitigate against that, and nothing has been done to alleviate those concerns from 2010 to now. One thing that's that's cited often by business owners and residents and desiring to go to a parklet is that they want the feel of an outside outdoor dining opportunity like Europe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is not close to that. European dining opportunities are based around plazas and street walks and simple things that are isolated from vehicles and hazards of those sorts. Finally, I just want to underscore the key stakeholders in this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The actual residents of Bar Shaw in the Pier were never effectively involved in the input of city leaders from 2020 on the November 2021 survey started with and focused on input from businesses and their customers. Outreach to actual residents was minimal and so many of our fellow residents have engaged since then and to say that the program'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Cynic can say. Estella and Julie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. I'm still a hider. This is a re.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tabulation of a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Survey that was undertaken by public works at the end of last year and presented to City Council December 7th. The survey was poorly constructed with unclear objectives, and the only meaningful inquiry was one open ended question. Regrettably, this was used as an indication of the public's interest in permanent parklets, although the specific question was never asked.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So lucky for me, I had a market research class in grad school, so I requested the raw data. All 584 responses to start. The original survey included responses from several districts, not just Belmont Shore, as was presented. There were 130 responses from other districts with comments pertaining to parklets in those areas, namely downtown Bixby and Fourth Street'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The re tabulated data shows a 37% support for parklets by respondents in the third District, and one fifth of those respondents support with restrictions that may or may not be addressed in a permanent parklet program. This is much lower than the 49% that was presented by public works.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city's presentation stated that those who opposed the parklets had, quote, concerns. This is not accurate. Comments against the Parklets expressed very strong opposition. There's a marked vigor, a marked difference in the vigor of responses regarding the parklets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those that support the Parklets had short answers. Those who oppose had lengthy, detailed explanations for the opposition. Although the city attributed one reason for each respondent who opposed the Parklets, the reality is that those who opposed the parklets cited several reasons for not wanting them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let me summarize the notable conclusions. The majority of respondents, 61%, do not want parklets. Those who oppose have strong feelings against the Parklets and they have multiple, multiple reasons for not wanting the parklets. I'd like to read a verbatim.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reduced safety pedestrian visibility. Lost increased traffic. Parking impacts. Vermin increase difficult to walk second street now tables patrons servers block pedestrians ADA issues lost parking for residents. Businesses already had sidewalk dining. In my opinion, this is the very opposite of Open Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one more thing that came forward is lack of utilization. The parklets are utilized mostly on warm weekend evenings, but otherwise they are empty. The impact on parking and traffic is 24 seven. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to try and stand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi, my name is Julie Deane and I've been a resident in Beaumont, Shaw for 25 years and I've been on the board of the Belmont Shore Residents Association for 13 years, and I'm currently the President. So lack of suitability Belmont Shores population density is not conducive to parklets or laps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The shore has only 2% of the city's population, yet 37% of the city's Parklets statistics show that traffic accidents with injuries increased on Second Street between Bayshore and Livingston from the year prior to the installation of Parklets to the first year of Parklets from 18.9% to 47.8%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So who gains a couple dozen bars and restaurants and who loses next door businesses that are hidden behind umbrellas and parklet walls that are topped with planters and their customers and residents who cannot find parking parklets are very busy for a very short period of time and they're extremely underutilized.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The vast majority of the time. Parking has been an issue in the shore for many, many years. In fact, we have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on parking studies that now we are sorry on parking studies, but now we are okay with eliminating 50, 60, 100 spaces.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That doesn't make sense. Turning right from Second Street onto a side street where there's a parklet near the corner is quite dangerous. Anyone with a low profile, including children, are in danger. A friend of mine with cerebral palsy asked me when the last time was that I saw someone in a wheelchair on Second Street, she explained.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They don't come because it's no longer welcoming to them. They've been shut out. If permanent Parklets were to move forward and make sure parts of the main public thoroughfare would be given to the to the for profit businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that just doesn't seem right. Residents quality of life has been impacted with increased trash, noise, vermin destroyed, parklet walls that stay that way for months and standing water moving to the pier area. There are three businesses in the pier area that are extensively encroaching on public space within the coastal zone against their permit, Belmont Brewing Company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'put in permanent anchors and railings to create an additional outdoor dining space. Iconix Fitness got a public street turned into a one way street for their OSP, with an elimination of 21 beach and business parking spaces, which goes against Coastal Commission rather than parking in their own parking space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Primal Alchemy Catering often parks in the public plaza, blocking pedestrian access. So what is our goal? What's our ask? What's the necessity? Belmont Shore is not fit for parklets apps or apps, whether temporary or permanent, whether at the pier or on Second Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our large group of residents cares about our quality of life and our community and wants our quaint, safer neighborhood back. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 1966 residents speaking as a small business owner. I manage a storefront on Fourth Street just adjacent to a restaurant, and I would have to say that that has.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A parklet in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It probably has been one of the worst experiences as a business owner. We've essentially lost three parking spots because of the congestion that ensues with the Parklet being there. You know, it's completely recalibrated the delivery time and system of all the other businesses in the area because the parklet that's connected to my shop, there's an alley that'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So I know, for example, we've closed down a lot of Parklets in Belmont Shore because they just weren't being used. And what we did was have staff go and ask the owners whether or not they wanted to continue their parklets and many did not.'",

But if we go back to that slide where it has IT director position listed and for those who didn't follow this previously, I think there was a discussion in this body that it would be a director and even a salary was suggested.'",

If you go back to the the report, it very specifically lays out the role, but it is roughly the equivalent of a director in any other city department. And yes, it would essentially replace that role currently that's in the city manager's office.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I look forward to the project's starting and I have committed to the residents and of course confirmed with our staff today in our Tidelands meeting that we are going to stay in consistent communication so that we can let residents know at every opportunity what is coming next in terms of the project and the construction so that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'everyone can get ready for it. And this is an amazing environmental project for the city and I'm grateful for the work the staff has done. So Mr. Lopez and the entire Tidelands team, thank you for your work.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, if I recall correctly, this project came before the Coastal Commission a few years ago and I was very happy to see the project going forward. I think we approved it and it's finally coming to fruition. If I remember correctly, it's it's quite a project that offers a lot of opportunity to activate a lot of the play'",
        "'speaker_5': 'areas and a lot of opportunities for for kids or for summer programing as well as throughout the year. So looking forward to this project being completed and to a ribbon cutting eventually some day early.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is in. And I'm told that this is one of a kind in terms of this is the only project that was happening in the state of California. So kudos, Councilmember Price, kudos, public works and Coastal Commission and everyone who had anything to do with this, any public comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dave Shukla and David.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Paretsky.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful piece approached the podium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Someone asked, and while they're walking up, I would be remiss to say I am the closer on this project. But Congressman Lowenthal, Gary DeLong, Frank Colonna and our mayor have had a tremendous role in this. I am just literally the closer of a project they all started, and I'm grateful to have been in that seat when the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'project came forth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dave Shukla.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Quickly walk all the way back home using this very route. And it's. In the past 25 years improved, but especially in the past couple of years really improved. And this is a great project I'm fully in support of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would be helpful if we already owned and operated all of our own utilities to be able to move projects like this one along faster. But that notwithstanding, there is a considerable amount of. Redoing of the natural landscape that was done in a very short amount of time to develop it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is one of the very few projects, not the only one actually in the state, just the only one that is coastal, but with a few projects in the state that's designed to actually increase and restore some of the natural capacity of from previously urbanized areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With respect to the utility. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Dave Peraza, board member with Friends of Colorado Lagoon. I've got so much to say that it would take 30 minutes, but I'm just going to say a couple of things. First of all, I want to thank the council and particularly Councilmember Price's leadership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would have been easy to, at the beginning of her last term to say, you know what, we made great progress. Let's let's call it done. But she really made a priority of getting this last step done. And we are forever thankful for that work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also really want to thank Public Works. We've been fortunate over this 20 year process to have had some incredible people to work with in public works, and we've had a lot of curves along the way. Obstacles came up in not just funding, but technical obstacles and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And every single time, city staff, particularly in public works, has found a way to make this work. We've done this. Mr. LOPEZ. Correct. Can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we've completed every single step that was identified in our restoration feasibility study except for this open channel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we've done so without using any general funds from the city of Long Beach. It's all been done by bringing grants into the city of Long Beach, federal, state and and even the original restoration feasibility study was paid for by a grant from the California Coastal Conservancy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So my hat's off to Mr. Lopez and his staff. Truly incredible work. And lastly, I'd like to thank the Port of Long Beach. They've been great partners throughout this process. They've saved our bacon multiple times. They have supported us financially.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have provided technical expertize, and they even bring their port volunteers down to events we have at the lagoon. They have been truly great partners. And this is one of the great things about Long Beach, if you ask me, is we've got a port, we've got great city departments, we have a wonderful city council that can see'",
        "'speaker_3': 'these visions. And this is how over 25 years since we first started that we have arrived here today. So obviously I urge your consideration to approve this. We're very excited as the whole community is, to get this project going.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There have been some wonderful renderings that have come out of the design documents, and when people in the community see these renderings, they get very excited. It's really going to be beautiful. Hope to see all of you down there when it's complete in what may be a year or 18 months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, I thank you all and please support this next.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That concludes the public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Is there any other comments from behind the rail with not let's vote on this momentous occasion. Members, please vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The carry.'"
