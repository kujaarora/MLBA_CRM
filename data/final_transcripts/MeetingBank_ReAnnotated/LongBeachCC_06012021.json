You'll start to see some of the results of that. We also will be bringing to the council next week an ordinance that, per the council's direction, increases the penalties for fireworks through an administrative'",

And that is through go Long Beach for residents that want to report there. And we're also going to be reporting out with the number of confiscations of fireworks activity because PD has actually been pretty vigilant in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that area as well. So it'll be a pretty comprehensive reporting out of all of those activities that the staff has been engaged in since the since the formation of the interdepartmental working group last summer regarding professional fireworks. Right now, the one that we strongly suspect will go forward is the one at the down in the marina, but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we're not sure about the other, the proposal for a potential second fireworks show in the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Councilmember, this is Tom. I think part of the question, too, was, are we seeing more fireworks in the hands of individuals because of COVID? And I think the answer is absolutely yes. I don't know where they're coming from, whether that's, you know, because they're professional or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what we're hearing on the illegal side is there's a lot more fireworks out there. It is incredibly profitable for people to deal with the illegal trade of fireworks, so much so that a number of groups are getting involved in that because the demand is so high for people to purchase them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we do have our P.D. forces working on that as part of the money that you set aside. And we'll be talking a lot more about fireworks next week when we bring you the urgency ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it. Thank you very much to both of you. And see, I stuck my question in at the tail end of my comments. So they didn't cut you off at the five minute mark? Like that's my new strategy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll ask all my questions, I'll make all my comments and then ask my questions at the end. I'm working at Councilman Super now. I've figured out an end run in the system. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you. Council members and data.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you. Thank you very much for bringing this forward. Councilmember Mongo. This is obviously, as you know, very, very important to me as well. Some of the highest calls that we receive, especially during the holidays, such as 4th of July, are regarding our fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not only are fireworks dangerous, but they also disrupt many of our residents, in particular Lee, our elderly, our very young children and residents dealing with trauma from and different forms of PTSD. And then and let's not forget how much they affect on our our dogs and cats.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, sorry. I thank you, guys. Vice Mayor, you're not muted. Thank you. So, yes, so they they also affect a lot our our furry, furry babies. And that also breaks my heart. I know I get a lot of calls from my residents, ongoing calls starting early, early like in early April and pass, you know, 4th of July'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So I'm really looking forward to next week and seeing what we can do about that. I truly understand that people want to celebrate with family and they want to celebrate their holidays as they should. However, it should be done in the safest manner possible, and I'm eager to learn more about what would a program like this with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'having in a sentence can do for our communities? Because CD1 is definitely a victim of illegal fireworks and the hardship of enforcement. We have, as you know, we have laws that prohibit illegal fireworks. It's just the enforcement that has been very difficult, which is why I'm really excited that the community has come together to to work with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city staff and us here on council to bring forward solutions that may help alleviate that. So I am in full support of this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember sorrow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you, Vice Mayor and thank you, councilman member Mongo, for bringing this item forward. You know, I'm always open to as many possible ways and figuring out how do we stop all of these illegal fireworks that keeps happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm also wondering how many fireworks occur late at night, and I'm wondering if there's ways the block parties often end at 7 p.m.. Is there consider maybe is there consideration to extending it so that there could actually be a time when people are lighting out these fireworks, if there are actually be, you know, parties where people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are witnessing and paying watch. Right. So I'm wondering if we did extend the time, how late we could go so that we could actually activate members to keep a lookout on on who's doing it and so forth. So that's one question I have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think the other and the other question I have is, is there going to be a limit? I'm just wondering, what are the numbers when the fees are way for these block parties? What's the number that we can give out?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Because I didn't see a cost. I'm just wondering what would be the limit? And it'll be first come, first serve in the way the process might roll out. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think those are some questions for staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is Linda Tatum again. I'll take the first question first, which is regarding the number of permits. We've done a little bit of research. And what we've discovered is that in the previous years, we've had about 70 applications for block parties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what we're estimating is that with this offer of a free permit, that number may potentially be kicked up some. So we're looking at around 100. However, we're not going to put a hard cap on it because I think we see this as a as a pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we'd like to get a feel for what the potential impacts of these of the free permits are so that we can see whether or not they really make a difference in terms of the number of calls. So at this point in time, we don't plan to have a hard cap on them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the if there is a potential limit, it would be based upon police's ability to to enforce them if they do have any issues with enforcement. So in the past, my understanding is that at a certain level, police will intervene and just suggest that they are beginning to get stretched thin with coverage of the enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we're just hopeful that we can have a really good number and that this effort is successful. So we're not looking at a hard limit. And in terms of extending the hours, I don't know if police's on the line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the only concern that we would have regarding that is the potential for enforcement. But I really can't speak to the PD's ability to enforce after dark because obviously there will be a lot of other activities happening in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the concern is the ability for police to provide just regular security and protection in addition to the potential exceedingly high number of block parties. So if PD is on the line and could respond to that, that would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you, Linda. Deputy Chief Michael Lewis here. And it is obviously a very busy day for us and will be, especially with the increase of a significant number of block parties arise. I know that the permit hours, I believe, is as established at 7:00 at night, which obviously it starts to get dark at seven.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So pressure on staffing and resources, not just from the police department, but other city department increases as the night progresses, especially after it gets darker. So I appreciate some consideration for the number of block parties to prove that that will definitely help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you and clarity before we move on. Councilwoman Tara, was was there friendly for Councilwoman Mongeau to respond to or no?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. It was just questions for staff. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Next, we have Councilman Miranda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mary. And I totally agree with all the comments made by my colleagues. It seems that every year fireworks is becoming more and more invasive in our communities. And this is a process. It's one that I hope will determine whether or not we continue with this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think more than anything else, we need we need to enhance our our policing of fireworks, especially at night is it's a cosmic missile. Brought that up. My district crosses the L.A. River now that I know that as well, councilmember and wise mayor, where, you know, we have a lot of fireworks off on the river.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sometimes they sound like they have a stick of dynamite and they're so loud. And cars and car alarms and dogs are are frightened and escape. And when they escape, they create other problems in the community. I had one in my district not too long ago that we ended tragically because of fireworks that went off.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So totally supportive of this item and I'm looking forward to how we can even strengthen that even more and make it less of a nuisance in our communities. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'competitive swimming and she talked about how she was a competitive swimmer and making opportunities for people who wouldn't have access otherwise to learn how to be competitive athletes. And it really got me thinking about Marine Stadium and the history of Marine Stadium as an Olympic venue and the city of Long Beach and the sport of rowing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure how much my council colleagues know about the sport of rowing, but I didn't know anything about the sport a few years ago. Before my boys got involved in it. We used to see the rowers on Marine Stadium all the time, but had no idea what it meant to do that sport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Since my boys have learned about the sport, I've learned a lot about the opportunities in that sport in terms of collegiate admissions aid and collegiate scholarships, especially for female rowers. We've seen a huge boost in the last few years, ever since rowing became an official NCAA sport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Teams are now allowed to give out 20 scholarships per year, and with rowing being an equivalency sport, those 20 scholarships can be divided in any way that a coach wishes to.

        "'speaker_7': 'But suddenly it was too full of trash to play. And that's not the case today. Over 30 plus years, my father has bagged that garbage, fought to get fencing, helped plant trees, flowers. And I'm pretty sure he's mowed the grass once or twice in that parkway.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's been instrumental in getting the city to create the grassy area and putting up fences, creating clean, relaxing area. It was a gorgeous contrast to the filth and dirt and danger that filled the place before. The most important thing about the Parkway is that he never asked for recognition for it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He never he never said this is mine. Even though he took pride looking out of his windows and seeing something he helped create. He never said someone should pay me because the parkway is its own reward. A swath of beauty near a historic landmark.'",
