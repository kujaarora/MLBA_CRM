I guess my response to that question is it depends on how the city moves forward with a key agreement under what's contemplated before you this evening, the city would essentially be purchasing power from PFG. PFG would own the assets, the solar assets, but we would be purchasing the power.'",

        "'speaker_5': ', English, Spanish, combined, Tagalog, all of all over four languages. What outreach efforts are we doing to make sure that our neighborhood associations and our neighborhood leaders have access these heading into the 4th of July weekend? Mr. Vice Mayor, as of today, I'll give you a rundown of all the activities that we've been doing through our fire prevention'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and community. And how about, you know, we don't even need all of them. I just think very specifically, if you're a neighborhood association working to get this stuff right, we can get those. You can reach out to Long Beach fire headquarters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can provide you access to those things. We will be making the rounds out to all the neighborhood associations, community groups, faith based organizations. Also be able to plug people in through our social media sites, our city website next door.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of the other social media sites that are active in our communities, we're targeting those as well to get the word out to people and we will be able to provide these these materials to them. Great. And I want to make sure I know funds are limited.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we want to allocate some resources to make sure we have, you know, enough of these lawn signs at our field office and at Fire Station 12, so we can partner to make sure those are available there, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, sir. Absolutely. And then in terms of we you know, we get a lot of chatter on social media that people don't know how to collect the right information to report, say an adult who's contributing to the delinquency of a minor and engaging here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I know that the police department does go around to every single one of our neighborhood association meetings every month. So is it possible, Chief Luna, to make sure that over the course of this next month we're equipped with specific message on here's the information that's helpful to actually make sure we can, you know, we can levy'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a fine or a ticket to someone who's engaging in fireworks. Can we make sure we have a message like that or a training available? Vice Mayor Richardson and members of the City Council, thank you for asking that question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, we have been doing that and will continue to do that and step it up. Honestly, I wish we can get through the 4th of July with issuing zero citations, but I don't believe that's a reality, unfortunately. We are going to stress or encourage community members to make sure that when they do see somebody lighting fireworks that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they call our communications center and any time the officers are going out there, we are encouraging the officers when they do see the illegal activity occurring to make sure they do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Issue the citations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if the parents are involved, there will be consequences for them as well. But I can't tell you how important it is for people when they see this activity to report it. I think somebody will be less likely to do it if they know everybody's watching them and will call the police when they're doing so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fantastic. So that concludes my my questions. And I just want to say, you know, we're we're one team here as a city. I see the chatter on social media on next door. I get it. I live in the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand the only way we can abate this is we really hold our neighbors accountable. So I have this lawn sign up. We'll have them available to our field office. We'll have them available at Fire Station 12. And feel free to continue engaging our police department and engaging your neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so much and happy 4th of July.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I want to thank Vice Mayor Rex Richardson for bringing this item forward. And I think you asked a lot of the same questions that I was going to ask. I did want to. Find out. Just so I know, every year around 4th of July, everybody says there's not enough officers out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Chief Luna, how many officers do we have out on 4th of July?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lots of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand. It's all of them. I know what I've been told.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, what we do. The 4th of July is the busiest day of the year for the Long Beach Police Department, as well as my partner here from the for the fire department as well. Unless you have a scheduled vacation or there's some unusual circumstances, you are working one of the shifts on the 4th of July.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So our staffing is significantly increased for that day. And I'm happy to report, although we're sitting here talking about a very annoying issue with fireworks, that really the men and women that work for the city entire, whether it's public works, the fire department or police department, if you take the last several 4th of July and how many'",
        "'speaker_5': 'people are in the city celebrating. Yes. And drinking, too. And some other things. We keep this city, at least we have in the past, thank God, very safe with the influx of people we have here. So we've done an amazing job.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think it's because of our planning. Our strategies have been very effective in dealing with with the fourth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you so much. Again, I just want to commend the work and I know I'll have a sign in my front yard and hopefully my neighborhood associations will also be able to get many signs as well. Thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I like to I just one question I can ask both. First of all, I want to commend our police chief and Chief DeVries for this. But because the question I'd like to ask is that can we put these signs up in our parks and recreation areas?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can these signs go up there?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember? Absolutely. We're happy to provide the access to these materials and where you place them. I would leave that up to up to you, certainly. And I would encourage I would encourage, you know, any council member who is interested in getting these signs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can definitely point you in the right direction. Thank you. Where you place them is up to you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Is there a public comment on this item? Please come forward. Sir. Mr. Goodhew.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Very good. I would suggest we do two things. One. Anybody caught doing fireworks? The fine is 1500 dollars. Period. That's an emergency order. Number two, the individual. Will. Spend. 50 hours per month in the animal shelter. And in addition to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We will pay any off any police officer or fire department member or any other security people. The city wants $1,000 if they find somebody and have for that, find somebody shooting out fireworks. Half of that will go to that officer, be it a policeman, fireman, somebody they hire, a city staff person, whoever.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we all benefit financially by that because quite frankly, posting those signs is useless, period. Half of them after kids will take those and use those. Like they're like the firecrackers from the fire that they set those that they use those to build.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So let's get pragmatic about it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Seeing no other public comment members, please go ahead and cast your votes.'"

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. City staff, please. Our esteemed assistant city manager, Tom Modica, will handle this. Thank you, Mr. West. Mr. Mayor and members of the Council. These are tidelands dollars that we're investing back into our convention center. It will be a mix of projects to upgrade some of the infrastructure and also to help the convention center book more'",
        "'speaker_5': 'business, especially out in that plaza area, which is very rapidly becoming a quite marketable area for them to bring in convention something like nobody else has around in the area. So we're available to answer questions if you have specific questions about the project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dr. Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I want to thank staff for their hard work on point rather the funds to make sure that our convention center, as I was talking earlier, has the bones working. And when do we expect some of these projects to break ground?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we expect the the fountain repairs to begin very, very quickly and we will sign an agreement with SMG and they will be conducting that project. We expect it hopefully in the next couple of weeks and to be completed by the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with the fountain repairs because it's 1.5 million, does that trigger a project labor agreement?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this it would. I'd have to check the actual agreement, I believe, because it's not done by the city, but by and done by an outside party, that it is not part of the project labor agreement project. The Labor Agreement covers city projects that are done with by city staff, but we can certainly take a look to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'see if they were included in that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let me ask, are the entitled costs of the found repairs 1.5 hours, some or someone else putting additional funds into.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The cost of the found is is 1.5.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's all city funds being used.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is city funds for that particular project. Yes, there are funds in the seaside way, general improvements. There are SMG funds that are that they are putting their own money into that and CVB money into that. Okay. I do want to point out, though, prevailing wage does trigger.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it is a prevailing wage project that is required when there is any dollar going into a project like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Tom. Yes. Just thank you for this. I know that we're making sure that, as we mentioned earlier, that not only is the convention center a beautiful place that people remember, but that we're maintaining our competitiveness by investing in it and making sure that that's an investment that's going to last a long time.'",
