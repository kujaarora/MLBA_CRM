We do this only every ten years and we really need to make sure that we're paying a lot of attention to this, as so much is reliant on'",
        "'speaker_6': 'our on our census. So we'd like to give you kind of a quick presentation of where we are and then answer any questions. So why does it matter if somebody can advance the slides?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here we go. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First, it's a constitutional mandate. It's something that's required that every city and jurisdiction does every ten, every ten years. It really affects our congressional representation. So counting every people is the only way that we know how many people there are so that we can determine how many congressional members California gets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The data is critical for redistricting, so we'll be going into redistricting process in 2021, and we really need to use that data so we get a solid process. As I mentioned, federal funding and state funding is directly linked to the census.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And of course, accurate data and demographics is really important for planning, policy and decision making. And so in the census, we tend to talk about hard to count areas. So we really focus our areas on on people who either don't want to be counted or aren't aware of the census and how do we make sure everybody counts'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And so some of those hard to count areas, the characteristics are low income neighborhoods, households below the poverty level, people older than 25 with less than a high school diploma, people who are unemployed, non-family households, single parent households, people living in low visibility housing renters and temporary residents and overcrowding households.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So very specifically, the hard to count populations are here on the screen. It includes everybody from senior citizens, immigrants and refugees, people with disabilities, individuals experienced homelessness, LGBTQ, Hispanics and Latinos, blacks and African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, children ages 0 to 4, veterans, people with limited English proficiency and college students.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so there are a number of steps along the way that we really need to focus on for our census challenges. So we start with a complete address list, trying to really get a very accurate list of every single address in Long Beach that that may have population in it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We look at kind of the broadband access. We're looking at privacy concerns as well. And, you know, there's the issue that we're in litigation on, on citizenship question. There's also, you know, less people this year to be able to go out and do an actual counting, depending on how they're doing the census.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's that field capacity. And then, of course, there's language barriers. The good news is that, you know, we're not doing this alone. We have a lot of partners. And so there is a lot of regional and state collaboration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Long Beach is really at the forefront of leading this effort. Not every city is taking such a proactive approach. There is the Los Angeles Complete Count Committee. There's the California Complete Count Committee, and the U.S. Census Bureau is putting a lot of resources into this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then locally, we're looking at creating our own complete count committee. And we've been working on a strategic plan and really how to mobilize all of our resources. So what have we done to date? We have engaged in the LUCA process, which is called the local update to sensor addresses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so believe it or not, but we identified 5800 new address locations. So we match all the databases that the county gives us with our databases. And we found 5800 new addresses that either deleted address or the new addresses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've also engaged with some of our community based organizations. We did a pilot with five Central CHA, United Cambodian community, St Luke's Latino in Action and will be forward to do a community based CANVASING initiative. And then we contract our contract with Community Connect Labs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, yes. And at this point, I'm going to turn it over to Kevin Jackson. Yeah. Hey, thanks, Tom, for stepping in. And this effort was truly an innovation and an example of the type of strategic collaboration that we envision for since his 2020 outreach moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was made possible through a contract with Community Connect Labs. Community Connect Labs is a nonprofit organization providing mobile technology solutions and training to help government, governments and service providers connect with hard to reach populations. The cost of this pilot initiative was partially offset by the city's participation at states like incentive program.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So not only do we have that partnership, but I was hoping that you could explain what does that partnership look like? Are we providing materials to them? And if we are, who's translating that material? Does it come down from the federal government?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that something that we do in-house or is that something that the CBOs are responsible for doing?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, Councilmember Pearce, I would state that community based organizations are what the 2020 centers are going to be receiving support from a variety of areas, principally from the state. The state has allocated funding to administrative, large administrative, community based organizations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The one that's representing L.A. County is the California Community Foundation, who received approximately $8 million to support provide funding, support for outreach activities for community based organizations. But in the context of our complete count efforts, we want to create a strategic plan that is synergistic to the county's strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we want to apply our resources that we're receiving to support that strategic plan. And part of that strategic plan includes support for CBOs. Then we will allocate funding for that. So I don't think that. So the short answer to your question is that the CBOs will be adequately supported from a variety of sources to to do'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on the ground outreach throughout the campaign. In terms of translating materials, the state is requiring that the county and any of the contracting entities with the county have a language access plan as part of their strategic plan. So we are actively working on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's part of our complete count effort. We will be making sure that we have resources available to support the translation of materials and providing them to community based organizations and others who are doing outreach on the ground.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you for that. And one other question. I know we can have as many strategic plans as possible, but if those organizations don't have the staff and the volunteers and the community groups to actually go out there and get in neighborhoods that we otherwise wouldn't, then it doesn't matter what strategic plan we have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I wanted to ask on the $300,000 in county funding for Long Beach, how much of that stays with the city and how much of that goes to the CBOs?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, at this point, since we're early in the process, I mean, we haven't even established agreement and we have a draft strategic plan at to this point. We want to make sure that we give the community an opportunity to weigh in on a strategic plan to establish the priorities in partnership with the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we don't have a specific amount that we set aside to support CBO outreach. I will I will add that our Lucca effort a year and a half ago is provides an early indication of kind of how we intend to work with community based organizations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we receive $15,000 through the local incentive program from the state of California to support our contract with Community Connect Labs to provide the technology. But we as a city, we allocated approximately $30,000 to support the community based organizations that did the canvasing in the hundred and 23 block groups as part of that effort.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, you know, we learned from that that was very successful. And so we think going forward, we realize that there is a need for resources for those groups and in order to do the work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you for that. I think my takeaway today is that I think that this is wonderful. In your conversations, in your strategic planning, I know we often whether in any kind of outreach that we as a bureaucracy try to do, it's never quite enough.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we can't do a job as well as the nonprofits and those organizations. And so I would hope that our funding would be centered on creating a structure to help them be successful in doing the work. I'm not sure if any of my other colleagues have comments on that, but thank you again for the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I know some of the CBOs are here. Thank you guys for rolling up your sleeves and doing the important work to serve our community.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Mayor and City Council. My name is James Swanson, the associate director at Long Beach Forward, where a community based organization here in the city. I'm also a third district resident. My sleeves always stay rolled up. So I just wanted to thank you and thank city staff that are moving us not only from the city manager's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'office, but from the mayor's office as well, and some of the council officers that we've met with already to be partners in the census effort, because we all know what it's what's at stake for the 2020 census for Long Beach Forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As an organization that supports movement building, we've taken on the role of being one of the one of six regional co conveners for the L.A. Regional Census Table. And this is a county wide effort that's never been done before and unprecedented because we know what's at stake in this county.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I really appreciate the partners that we've been able to meet with so far in this, because the L.A. Regional Census table is a space for community based organizations to organize ourselves in the city of Long Beach, where we serve community members in the city, outside the city, and to talk about how we can strategize and connect'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and work together to do census education and outreach, because we know once come once January comes, we're going to have to hit the ground more than running. We're going to have to be really going at it to make sure that we cover every inch of these hard to count areas in the city and these community based organizations'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we've been working with over the past. It's the end of last year. I've been meeting in Long Beach, have amazing outreach plans that are really upping the game and what it means to actually do authentic community engagement into people who haven't been reached before.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And when we think about these hard to count populations, of course, it's probably no surprise that the hardest to count areas in the city are areas like central west and north Long Beach, including also the Beverly's and the fourth District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As you can imagine, a lot of student housing of students who live there. But just to give you a snapshot, just yesterday, the state of California released some really amazing tools to read, to describe hard to count populations not only in cities, but other counties that encourage anyone else in the community who wants to know more to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'check out the California State Census website. But just to give you an idea about what these hard to count populations are like, the top populations in Long Beach and Crewe include overcrowded rental units, limited English speaking households, households without broadband subscriptions or Internet access, families that are 150% below the poverty line and families facing unemployment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there is no easy task to reaching these communities and these populations. But we're really looking forward as these community based organizations are getting organized and partnering with you all and to learn and share from each other not only about how authentic engagement can be done, just like the Lucca canvasing that we were part of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But how we can use this process not only as a community building strategy, but a local hire strategy so we can get people in the community who know the community best, but also really build a wealth building strategy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're in good terms going into 2020 and 2021 and beyond. So thank you so much for your efforts and I hope you have a great night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our next big final speaker, please, on census.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council members. My name is Pat Kennedy. I'm with the Greater Long Beach Interfaith Community Organization. Just wanted to appreciate the complete count effort the city is looking at. To be honest, we've been working closely also with Long Beach Forward, trying to figure out how do we engage non-profits across the city to engage deeply in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'terms of getting people out and getting them counted. We think the difference between 450 and a half a million people is going to be those hard to reach people. And that's going to be a big difference, obviously, in our budget, in our resources in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we hope that 300,000 that a significant portion of that is invested in getting people that are trusted messengers knocking on doors and talking with people. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And we're going to go ahead and go back to item. 42.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report from Public Works Recommendation to award a contract to raise construction for construction of the Naples Islands. Seawall Repair Phase two project for a total contract amount not to exceed 15,685,900 for District three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let's begin by turning this over to our staff. So, Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council. So tonight before you is a pretty significant project. We wanted to give you a very quick update on. So the Naples Sea, I think a lot of us have been down to Naples.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a beautiful part of town. And we walk around those seawalls and most people don't recognize that those are actually public walkways. So those are not part of people's houses. Those are the public domain, which is why it's such an open, inviting area to go down to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we've been assessing those Naples Sea walls over the last several years, and they're in need of repair. There's seven different fit or six different phases, and two of them have been the most critically identified as really in need of repair, specifically for seismic and for other types of of degradation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so in 2009, we started this effort and identified the issues. We did our six total plans, and then we actually completed phase one in 2015. And so we're here to talk about phase two. The scope of work is we really need to protect homes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's on the left side. As we protect our existing infrastructure and homes, we then demolish what's there already and then we create a new walkway and a new seawall that goes along with it. So phase two is a little bit different than phase one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The project actually is not one single area of the canal. In fact, it's three separate landmasses. It's a little bit bigger than phase one. It's another 240 feet. And it's more complicated because the sheet piles have to go down 4.4 and a half feet to accommodate those rougher waters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's 60 concrete piles that support larger docks, and there's two new pump stations as part of the project. And so this is a more complex project, a larger project, and it's about 17.9 million total funded out of Thailand.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So these are not funds that are general funds that could go to streets and roads. It's all out of the tidelands. So you get a sense of where the site is. So we're looking at Treasure Island and the entrance to the Naples Canal is where we would be doing the work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's the next vulnerable part. So a lot of what we're trying to do is to replicate what we did from phase one. So we learned a lot from the community outreach and a lot of the technical issues there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we did learn some things from phase one, specifically about the utility conduits, about some of the desires of the residents to plant some technical issues with our access platforms and also our pile caps and some of the some of the issues to make sure people aren't just sitting out there in a dangerous condition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So for construction timelines, we're really excited to be here in front of you today. So summer 2019, we would go out and start working with homeowners and do all the project submittals that are necessary and site preparation. We then would start the project in early 2020 when you install those huge sheet piles and push them down into'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the water. And then 2021 and fall would we would have substantial completion. So tonight before you is a recommendation to adopt the plans and specs. It's about a contract of $13 million with a 13% contingency. And with that, we're available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you. Great presentation. I want to turn this over to Councilwoman Price first.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you to our staff one for working so hard and learning the expertize on this project, but two for conducting so much community outreach on this. Many people don't know that the first phase involved a whole construction scheme that was different than anything that we had done before, given the materials that we were using and the type'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of construction that was required. And so we've had to utilize a lot of lessons learned from the first phase to make phase two be efficient and cost effective as best as we can. So I appreciate the the expertize that's been developed by our Tidelands team to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm also very mindful that as we look towards our climate adaptation plan and talking about our climate adaptation challenges in the future, making sure that our sea walls are structurally sound is a very important component for all of our all.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Coastal communities throughout the state, but especially, of course, here in Long Beach. I do want to thank the residents. I'm not sure how many of the residents are here, how you guys, they really have worked very hard on this project, attending monthly meetings for years, especially.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Maureen Poe is here. She really has been a champion for the entire neighborhood in making sure that she advocates for the residents in regards to this particular project. This project is really important to the city because every year, especially around Christmas time, tens of thousands of people come to Naples to visit the area, to enjoy the sights'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And we need to be able to provide an environment that is safe and a public walkway that is structurally sound. So I'm very grateful for the work that's been done on this. And I want to thank the residents who are here.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Cost to further.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Identified. And I think if we can have consistency to the extent possible with phase one in terms of the railings, that will be very important, even though it may not be as cost effective as going with a different type of railing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to make sure that we have consistency and are paying attention to the esthetic needs of the community in that regard. So with that, I want to thank our staff for being involved and helping with this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilor Pearce. I just want to add a few comments. First, I just want to thank staff as well. I think a lot of folks don't realize how important of an infrastructure project are or Master Seawalls project actually is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The first phase was incredibly complex, but we also, like Councilman Price said, learned a lot. And I think the Tidelands team did a great job of working with the community and the project. Beyond being a large project within our Tidelands is also it's just a massive infrastructure project and also a public safety project.'",

I, I had communicated a little bit with Councilman Price today, and I agree also the issue on the railings and the the fence or the railings, whatever you want to call it, I've had some communication with some folks that live there'",

        "'speaker_0': 'our ability.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. MODICA Yeah, so we absolutely agree that it would be nice to have consistency. We really like the design. It has to do with whether it's a horizontal fence or a vertical fence, as we've been working on this project and costs have been kind of creeping up on us as they do with every every cost, the cost'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of every project, the cost of steel. First and foremost, we wanted to make sure we got all of the project done because the safety came first. But we would really like to find solutions to get back to that original fence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the project is bid actually has the vertical fence in it. Our plan is halfway through the project. We're going to see how we do and if we can make the change order and get that upgraded fence, we would love to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's about a half million dollar change order. We're open to that and we'll just do the best to make sure we don't run into any problems. And then we hope that will work out quite well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just it's not just I understand that. And so I'm I'm glad that we're going to hopefully commit to doing that because it's not just about what we're installing. It's a completely esthetic change to where currently is there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think to go from one kind of traditional classic look that we've had to then completely change that I think would be not consistent with just the look of, of the whole neighborhood. So I just want to make sure that we're as committed to that as possible.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Rex Richardson brought it on the floor that we could adjust certain things. I haven't heard anything back about any kind of a adjustment to the ordinance as read. I'd like to have an answer for that if possible. My concern on this ordinance, frankly, is for tenants, not for landlords, particularly the more stringent we make any kind of'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Contract between landlords and tenants. The more stringent the landlords will be in selecting tenants. Right now we do favors for people and say, Oh, you have a 505 score, we'll let you rent anyway. We don't care. You're a nice person, but if it becomes too onerous with relocation costs, not based on the 10% thing which the state'",
        "'speaker_6': 'already said, but don't just cause eviction, it may make it difficult for people to get an apartment because the standard will be so high. And so I think there's always consequences to what we do, and I hope that we will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, if you are going to pass this ordinance that in the future we look at that and see come back to it maybe in a year to figure out if we can amend the ordinance, as Miss Price had wanted to do.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council Mayor Chuck Brewer. I am here to say that since the conversation of this ordinance had come into place, I have seen rents already go up and it's hurting. The tenant. This ordinance will eventually hurt the tenant. I've also seen investors who are excited about the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Talk about leaving the city. We've seen this before. We've seen it in. In our businesses. As Toyota has left the state, we're right now. The hot area to buy in is not California. Well, you know, when you go up there, let them know that we're seeing businesses leave.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're seeing people leave and people who want to invest in the state leave. Delaware statue trusts are one of the way it goes. So when toilets need to be correctly cleared, windows need to be fixed, and there's damage to buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And a landlord can't make a decent profit to do this because of ordinance of rent control like this, it will eventually hurt the tenant and our city. Our city deserves better. I think there's unforeseen consequences and we see it in our city just like we see potholes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We thought we couldn't fix the city, let the potholes go. Well, the same thing is going to be with the tenants and the landlords.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So my my I hope this you will understand that instead of doing something to reduce homelessness, this is going to create homelessness. And it's big enough as it is. We want to do better in our city. And I hope that this passes because another thing is also the risk, not only the rent control is high, but also'",

And we also urge you to make the critical fixes that we did discuss in the last round, especially to ensure that tenants do receive their relocation assistance before they are required to move.'",

I'm eager to see this policy and other policies continue to be strengthened to better protect the renters that make Long Beach the diverse and vibrant city that we always love to talk about. I've heard that word thrown out a lot tonight, and I love my city, too.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, it's great that we got the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Urgency to reflect that crisis and I think to make it stronger, we got to make sure that these tenants get the money before they move out so they can actually use that money to get the next place they're going to live instead of winding up without a home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's kind of the really what the spirit of this policy is supposed to get at. And I hope we can I hope we don't forget to prioritize that additional source of funding that we want to find to provide the extra relocation amount to seniors and disabled renters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, I hope this remains a priority because these are some of the most vulnerable to displacement and have the least amount of safety nets. So thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Council Mayor Garcia, I mean, I'm not sure why I'm here because you guys have already decided to push this through. So it's kind of I think the people that watch this on TV need to know that everything's already decided before we hit this council chamber.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So congratulations housing Long Beach, because you already made it happen. But the truth is, yeah, congratulations. But you know what? The real loser is going to be the tenants, because they're the ones going to lose their housing. And you guys can take the blame for it because they're going to lose their housing because you push policy that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'isn't going to keep you in your homes. So you guys should think again. When you push policy like this, it's bad for the tenants. Rent controlled cities have the highest rent in the nation. So I mean, I'll benefit as a property owner because now I can push my rent really high now because I'm going to need to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because of the policies you're pushing. So, hey, think about it. Santa monica rent control, highest rent in the nation, San Francisco rent control, high rent, New York rent control. So you're pushing policy that's going to raise rents. You're going to put it on the backs of the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're going to have a lot of small property owners lose their housing. You're going to lose your housing when the property owners lose their buildings. So think about it, because as you grow your political future, you're harming a lot of people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're harming a lot of people, and you're making it look like you're helping them, but you're hurting them. You're going to hurt a lot of people. Like in Santa monica, 30% of the Latin population was vacated out when they implemented Erika Charles So think about that.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'The rest of it I'm okay with, but I don't like the just cause eviction portion of it. And I look forward to bringing this item back or having somebody bring it back so that we can make those modifications, which I do believe is in the works.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thanks to the speakers here tonight. I have a couple of questions of staff. One involves education and the other involves data analysis. Can staff explain what kind of outreach or training we're doing or plan to do in the future?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the dilemma we have is calls to our council office.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Both from tenants and from landlords, wanting the policy explained.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we have budgeting here to conduct that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or what is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The plan moving forward?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, Councilmember I'll have Linda Tatum and Patrick Harris answer those questions. And yes, we're planning on a very robust outreach campaign.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just to elaborate further, the outreach campaign will involve direct contact with the property owners, as well as the residents using the business license address list, because landlords are required if they have four units or more, to get a business license.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Using that as a primary tool, we will be able to identify the very specifically the landlords.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Provide them with some of the material that was specifically called out in the ordinance regarding information that they'll need to transfer to the tenants. But in addition to that, we have a number of other outreach sources, such as providing information on the city's website, on social media.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll have a fairly robust outreach effort, and we're I'm happy to share that in a little bit more detail with the city council in a24 from memo to. So you'll have a better idea of that going forward. That, frankly, was one of the reasons we asked for additional time just to allow staff to pull together those resources'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to make sure that we make a very concerted effort to get the word out to landlords and to the tenants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Will.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Come forward? I'm sorry, could you repeat we're getting questions daily about the Policy Council. Should I sell my units now or whatnot? So the response is we will have those answers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Forthcoming at a certain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Point. Yes. And you can also feel free to direct them to the Development Services Department. We're happy to respond to those questions on a one on one basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, great. Thank you. My other question is on data analysis and what type of data we have in terms of the number of people impacted. And I'm not sure if much of this was data driven, but do we know how many people have how many landlords have raised rent?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, for instance, I think we know the number for Plex's in the city. The number I have is 2829, if that sounds about right, do you know how many sold in the last year? Would staff know that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unfortunately, Councilman, we don't have that that kind of data available to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That number is 97 have sold. So my question would be, I wonder if.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're going to at a certain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Point either benchmark where.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We are now in terms of how many rents have been raised of that 97, where the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Apartment houses have changed ownership. I just think we either need a benchmarking exercise for where we are so we can track this ordinance as we move forward. So that'd be my request. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Agreed. And we can certainly accommodate that. That was one of the purposes of the program so that as we get payments made out under the provisions of this, we would have some data that we could start tracking and report back to the to the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Director. I think we're on the same page. I just wanted to bring it up for the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Public so there's no thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. And finally, Councilman, can. Oscar.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to say thank you to our all of the housing advocates. We started this about a year and a half, almost two years ago. Of course, it's gone beyond. And now in my last final meeting, I'm really, really proud of this this ordinance.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Congressman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. So tonight we are recognizing a year and a half of work carried out by Long Beach stakeholders and community members who set out to take a deeper dove into the question of how do we change the narrative of the tale of two cities here in the city of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Two very different economic realities for the people who live in the city. We've set out on set on a process of learning, information gathering to ensure that we understand the challenges and opportunities that face our community. I know this this conversation began in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And since then, you know, I joined the Economic Development Committee, Economic Development and Finance Committee. And I was, you know, very clear with Mayor Garcia that this is this is the deeper conversation I'd like to have in this post.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so tonight, we conclude that research and engagement process, as we submit to the Council five recommendations to advance economic opportunity and economic inclusion here in the city of Long Beach. So here's a little bit of context. We kicked off in 2017 for this deeper dove into economic inclusion, which is already referenced in our economic blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We dedicated time to learning what economic inclusion is, and we explored strategies that help us expand on economic opportunities to communities that have traditionally been left left behind for generations. The first phase was dedicated to learning, and it had three steps.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These slides are going to advance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, we got it. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So great. So. So the everyone listening tour engaged. So it began with learning and listening. So we began with a listening tour. We engaged 100 Long Beach residents from underrepresented communities and nine equity based focus groups to create 12 community solutions and to hear what the community really felt.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It was a listening session, to hear what they felt about the economic reality in Long Beach. Then we hosted policy roundtables in partnership with L.A. LISC that facilitated a series of five roundtables addressing specific aspects, different aspects and ideas around economic inclusion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We commissioned a report from policy linking from USC program for Environmental and Regional Equity, the policy link, equitable, equitable growth profile. All of those things, you know, came to City Council in 2017 and over the course of the last year they took place in the data and the lessons we learned really.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The city staff did a good job on that first step and it really set it set the stage and the framework for phase two, which was community led. This report summarizes this report, you know, conducted by my office, by a lot of the partners, by LISC, by Economic and Policy Impact Center, reflects that that next step of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that process, it wouldn't have been possible without community partnership from Wells Fargo, who helped support the community outreach process with L.A., LISC and all of the community members who are here. So phase two really was focused on debt, on solutions, right?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The first phase was listening and let's hear what the problem is. And the second phase is really solutions. So we began by convening a multidisciplinary work workgroup of Long Beach community partners known as the Implementation Committee. This was made up of of community partners, economic development commissioners, stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And at our first meeting, several community members expressed their readiness to roll up their sleeves and get to work. Over the course of three months, the economic I mean, the implementation committee helped us condense 20 separate recommendations and objectives down into five comprehensive recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The committee examined each strategy considering the content, the current level of support from city staff, the needs and interest of the community, and our best practices in action around the country. And the five strategies are feasible, as some can be accomplished in the short term and some are very comprehensive.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It may take up to five years to fully implement some of these these bigger ideas. Here are the five recommendations. Then we took it to the community. We took we took it on the road. We took the show on the road and hosted nine community conversations with Long Beach residents and business owners across the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Partnering, partnering with Councilmembers Councilmember Garang on the West Side, the Economics Student Association at Cal State Long Beach, the Council of Business Associations. On the Small Business Conversation, we co-hosted the Conversations with Councilmembers Gonzales and Pearce in the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We partner with Central Cha. We partnered with the United Cambodian community, the LGBTQ Center and the Long Beach Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. So over the course of three months we engaged more than 300 community members in dialog centered on these five key strategies.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Gathering input on each concept. The plan highlights the community feedback in each recommendation to ensure the strategy achieves the best intended outcome. So while these recommendations have been vetted by the community, the implementation plan presents the context, the timing, additional consideration as we hand this off to city staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So here are the five recommendations that we landed on. So first and I'm going to I'm going to lift up each of these. So first is to establish a municipal small business council with dedicated staff to provide representation, advocacy and technical technical assistance to every small business in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It may sound like a big, big idea, but for a city our size, there is room to expand our business groups in our city, our business districts do very well, but they represent businesses. They advocate for businesses within a defined boundary.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our Chamber of Commerce is present and they're engaged. But there are cost burdens to be involved in the Small Business Council at the Chamber. What about any small business in the city that's not located within a business district and may not have $500 a year to join a business association?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So during the Cambodian community conversation, an attendee expressed he discussed the obstacles he and his wife faced while while in the process of starting a business and and he was an immigrant and with English as a second language, he he recounted his difficulty in finding others within the industry to talk with or engage with, with with the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'different agencies that help navigate the processes of establishing a business. And there are a number of, you know, several mom and pops across our city located outside the boundaries of business districts who have no idea, who lack the navigation support to really access the resources that already exist for our city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so establishing a municipal small business council allows for industry clusters, it allows for ethnic clusters. You know, an African-American business committee, Latino Business Committee, Cambodian Business Committee, all of this can be sort of facilitated through this first recommendation of I mean, of a municipal small business council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So our second recommendation, which is centered on procurement, is the recommendation is increase the percentage of that the City of Long Beach spends on local, small and diverse businesses by establishing a streamline certification process, integrated vendor database for Long Beach agencies and institutions, and a transparent supplier diversity goals.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the idea here is that, you know, we over the course of these conversations, we learned that, you know, if you want to certify as an African American business and compete for bids, it's a different process from the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Then when you jump over to Long Beach Transit or Long Beach City College or Long Beach Unified School District, at each step you may have a different process to certify as a small business minority owned businesses, so on and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We even heard a story we might might hear tonight. I'm not sure about. You know, someone had to prove that they were were African American. And they actually to prove that they were African American, they needed to find their their military records of their father who said, you know, Negro on it in order to prove that they'",
        "'speaker_9': 'were African-American to receive those incentives. And so in a lot of cases, we have an opportunity to really look at these different agencies and align our strategies to make it simple, to simply opt in and say, I'm an African-American business or I'm LGBTQ business.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In a lot of cases, it takes a lot of extension, extensive paperwork. It takes multiple attempts at certifying as small as a small business or a minority owned business. You know, and frankly, many people want to pursue government contracts, but they are just discouraged from the process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've done a lot of work and we want to recognize a lot of work that we've done to add preferences for women owned businesses, veteran owned business, LGBT, LGBTQ businesses. And all of those are good, good efforts. But we should really be thinking about how do we comprehensively change the process and design it to really suit the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'businesses that we want to that we want to support. So imagine if we set goals within our purchasing purchasing thresholds to support local businesses. L.A. County just established a 25% threshold for local, local, small businesses and social, social enterprises.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so if we take a step back and really take a long view and say, let's comprehensively think about how we conduct procurement in the city of Long Beach, we can we can take this a long way. So the third recommendation is centered on workforce and youth development.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the recommendation is develop a plan to expand and deploy workforce development services to every Long Beach teen center. So modernizing our teen centers is a great strategy that that was discussed at our economic at our implementation committee dialog.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's already great momentum for this idea that's been introduced by a number of council members, including Councilwoman Mongeau, as well as Vice Mayor Andrews. It's it's you know, it's already in conversations with Parks and Recreation and with and with our Workforce Development Agency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The conversation here is how do we make our workforce resources accessible to the people who need it most? Data tells us that our youth unemployment rate is three times the average unemployment rate within the city of Long Beach, each Long Beach Teen Center.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you see the map here is strategically located near a high school on a park ground and strategically located in north central west downtown east Long Beach. There's a teen center in every part of town. So if we take our workforce resources and we align them with the teen centers and have a strategy to address teen employment'",
        "'speaker_9': 'by anchoring and rethinking our teen centers, we can make a big difference here. And so this is you know, this recommendation had a lot of support and it seemed like a make sense, you know, short term idea that we can move forward on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our next idea is really rooted in our need to expand the capacity to support small businesses and deliver services to neighborhoods who maybe have felt the need to compete with other neighborhoods to receive attention. And so this recommendation is to support the establishment of a community development corporation, to deploy programs and services that support the economic development'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and financial empowerment of north central west Long Beach and the small businesses citywide. And so the concept here is that CDC would essentially provide services that go beyond the traditional scope and scope of local government, such as financial literacy classes, credit building work workshops, expungement clinics, support and education around housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so those are some of the things that the CDC could do. So that is a recommendation here. And then our fifth recommendation is is really started centered on housing. So we we've had, you know, a lot of work around housing production in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've done a lot of work around. We had a conversation earlier tonight about tenant protections. And really the committee felt the need to lift up the conversation. Really that's centered on home ownership because it is still the chief means of wealth building in our in our community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the recommendation is support community based organizations, efforts to become a HUD certified home buyer counseling education agency. And so here's the concept is that Long Beach, the length, the mortgage landscape is changing. The green lining report told us that seven of the of the top ten mortgage originators in the city were non-banks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Only three were banks of the top ten. And so these are your Quicken Loans and your new American funding. And these guys, they're not subject to CRT. A lot of them are a lot more flexible, and that's a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But there's a trust gap. And some folks some folks may need a certified sort of source of education in their local community to know that they can trust these products. And so in in conversations with HUD and looking through HUD, there aren't very many HUD certified housing counselors in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I believe the closest one is is neighborhood housing services in the city of Compton. There's community interest in this. They provide advice on buying a home, renting the default process, process, foreclosure avoidance, reverse mortgages and more. And so, given what we know about our city, the changing landscape, it makes sense that we prepare and educate our communities'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for homeownership. We know there's a lot more we can do, like down payment assistance the city's already working on. But we can start now with a very small step in creating this HUD certified process. And so those are the five recommendations, as you know, that we're moving forward here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Some of them have already come to city council. Some of them already gained city council support. But we we wanted to culminate this process by bringing it forward. And I want to at this point, I want to say I want to acknowledge everyone who's participated in this process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There were really, you know, a number of organizations. And I would ask if you if you at any point participated in the everyone in process, if you could just stand so we can recognize you. So I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You can you can go ahead and have a seat. Thank you. But I want to invite down representatives from four agencies have really been a pivotal to this everyone in process. So I'll love representatives from L.A., LISC, the The Economic Policy Impact Center, Wells Fargo and Long Beach Community Action Partnership.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you can come down, I know that there's we have a presentation for you and we and you have an announcement for us. So if you could make your way on down and I think we'll hear from LISC first, then I think it'll be CAPP and Wells Fargo and then we'll hear from Economic Policy Impact Center.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. They're coming down.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice mayor and the council members on the dais this evening. I thank you so much, Councilman Richardson, for that presentation. So I am tonight with Rush in Turk and I'm the executive director of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're a national economic development firm, and we have invested 25 million in L.A. County just in 2018 alone. I'm a local Long Beach resident, and I'm here to share with you some of the things that we do at LISC that we're so excited that we've been doing here in Long Beach and Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're on the ground. LISC is in more places than any other community development organization. We have staff, expertize and relationships in more than 25 L.A. County communities. We listen, and I'm so proud. That list was asked by Councilman Richardson to co-chair the Everyone in initiative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This provided us a chance to engage with the many local leaders, neighbors and stakeholders that are here today to plan and to make policy recommendations that you have before you tonight. We innovate. We're we look at making we look at testing ideas on the ground and making sure that those ideas can be adapted nationally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're proud to be testing out new models for local business ownership here in Long Beach through a succession planning process to create worker owned cooperatives. We were able to attract several hundred thousand dollars to make that happen. We see the big picture.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'LISC is all about comprehensive development. We tackle issues all at once. We work on housing, business, jobs, education, health, safety in the same place at the same time. And finally, we have an impact as a partner, not only with the city, the council here in the Economic Development Department, we have helped to launch Long Beach as a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'key VA city. And today to date, we have recruited more than 13 trustees that have supplied microloans up to $160,000 just here in the city of Long Beach. And LISC was helping to match those loans dollar for dollar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I urge the Council to support the policy recommendations that are before you. You can see that these are strategies that come from the ground, from the people of Long Beach. And we cannot have a thriving Long Beach if everyone is not part of our economic prosperity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're proud to partner with all the community stakeholders that are here today as part of the Everyone in initiative. We want to thank the Citibank Foundation, Wells Fargo, the Economic Policy Institute, the city of Long Beach, and, of course, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your continued commitment to ensure that Long Beach is an equitable city for all of its residents.'",

We are an advocacy and think tank nonprofit, working to expand economic opportunity to disadvantaged communities through civic engagement, leadership, development and policy advocacy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'First off, I'd like to thank Councilmember Richardson for your leadership on such an important issue. It takes bold leadership to not only listen to, but respond to the needs and concerns of our city's most vulnerable residents. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of this work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'From my involvement in the implementation committee meetings to leading the engagement of over 300 residents and business owners and community conversations, I witnessed firsthand the excitement and hunger for this work. It has been an absolute honor to be a part of it, and I look forward to continuing the movement toward creating a local economy that includes and'",

And we're we're proud to serve in that capacity, first and foremost, because we have the fiscal integrity and leadership as an agency to be able to do so and certainly in a such an important role.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Secondly, because we know that in doing so, the success of this initiative means the success of those that we serve. And it's very much in alignment with things such as workforce development, entrepreneurship, creative space that we do. So it's not a big stretch for us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a matter of getting to work and doing what we do best in service of something that will be best for this community. So in addition to working with you and the council district to make this happen and the council and at whole, we are also proud to work with Wells Fargo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's not going to be a stretch either, because they've been our banker since we grew from a $1.3 million agency to a $10 million agency. And we are proud to serve with them. They know us. We know them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's a seamless relationship as well. So thank you for the opportunity to serve and thank you for your leadership in making something as innovative as this happen in our community. And we're proud to be in the ninth District to work closely with you on it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Derek. And and so if you could stand up there while while Linda gives her remarks there, you're an incredible partner on the fourth recommendation, which is establishing the Community Development Corporation.

        "'speaker_4': '2017. From the community conversations to the roundtables and even to the summit and program planning, this initiative embodies what we at Wells Fargo really believe in equity and inclusion. Wells Fargo realizes that we are only as strong as our community, and that strength is really in that foundation of access to housing opportunities for small business growth, and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'having workforce development opportunities for our youth and for our adults. Thank you for including us, along with residents, community leaders, nonprofit organizations and public and elected officials. In this effort, as we all share in shifting that narrative and changing the statistics on economic inclusion and prosperity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On a personal note, I can really speak to that shifting narrative because my parents moved to Long Beach in 1990 as Southeast Asian immigrants really looking for access to opportunities and homeownership and to also have a thriving business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So and hearing that there is this conversation about how can we really be more inclusive? Really was more of a personal inclination. But for this opportunity to be here on behalf of Wells Fargo and to speak on behalf of this on a larger level and be an advocate has really been a tremendous honor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have supported the summit as the title sponsor and also supported the planning phase, which really brought together a lot of collaboration and partnerships.

        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank Councilman Richardson for this presentation. It's great. I love this packet. I was looking through it and it has a lot of great information. And one of the recommendations that I really, really like, I mean, all the recommendations are great and I haven't been involved in the process, so I'm not in the weeds on'",
        "'speaker_8': 'any of them. But the one that I really liked that I was reading was the Workforce, the Youth Development one. I think it's so important for us to teach our young people early some job skills. I know that when we get interns in the office, a lot of them, when they're in high school, they need to learn'",
        "'speaker_8': 'organization. They need to learn, like you said, like the pamphlet says, customer service, you know, all those basic job training. So I think that's really, really important. And I'm happy that it was included here because I think that's a really big asset for our youth throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think this is great. I mean, it's it's wonderful to see that you had an idea and you developed it and you got engagement from the community and that it's to the point that it is today. Nicely done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, thank you. Thank you. Counsel women peers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for your work on the Everyone in plan. I know this has been long in coming and I especially want to thank all the community members. I know often our electeds, sometimes we ask you guys to participate in work groups or housing groups and we ask for your input.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We ask you to be on commissions. And I know that this is one of those times that not only did you guys get invited to the table, but you really got to roll up your sleeves and add input that is presented in this presentation today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that's really meaningful and powerful whenever we talk about how we make sure that everybody is included and that those ideas have some momentum behind them, because we can put ideas up here on this council all day long.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But unless we have people on the ground that are willing to put dollars into that program and put sweat equity into that program, it's not going to see the fullest potential that that it could be. And so I think that is a great there is a lot of recommendations in here that we've had side conversations on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's great to be able to now hopefully be able to have them come back one by one as and give them some more tofu, as I like to say, not not meet, but tofu to be able to help add them.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think that this is a great plan. I really appreciate that. A lot of the work that's been done wasn't left out. I know that it's important to start something and to to get the buy in from the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I can see that each of you added your input along the way. I know some of these things start out in the community and some of them started out at the dais, but until they're adopted and embraced by the community, they're just words.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so thank you for each one of you who really took the time to go to the listening sessions and to make these policies the best possible, because we do it the Long Beach way. So great work, everyone.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And yes, thank you very much. I just want to give complete kudos to Councilman Rich Richardson, because the fact that usually when he gets his money and he had put into something, this young man, he never stops. And I think a lot of that has to do when you look out here in the audience and see individuals'",
        "'speaker_5': ', when he said a two year plan, I mean, sometimes you can't get people to come together for a week. This is two years he put together and look at the output here. I just want to let every one of you guys know there will be something that comes from this that will make a difference.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the city of Long Beach and I want to thank you again, Councilman Richardson, because I know this is world work. When everyone is in and we talk about the village, you are the village. And I see that this will come to fruition.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Item 33 Communication from Councilmember Richardson. Councilwoman Gonzales, Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Miranda Recommendation to request City Manager to work with the Department of Economic Development to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a special economic empowerment zone program in the targeted areas of North, Central and west Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Furthermore, request to report back on the program in 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And so during the course of the community conversations, we we kept coming along across that theme of the tale of two cities and how we know that there's a different set of economic circumstances in north and central west Long Beach that that have gone on, persisted for generations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, this was an opportunity for us to to listen to the community and say there needs to be a separate recommendation here that takes a takes a look at existing opportunities that are happening now, like the Federal Opportunity Zone program that we know is really focused on sort of front loading investment as well as, you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know, our state program, which is really are our major strategy for north central west Long Beach redevelopment, which ended in 2012. And and we know that shifting politics, shape shifting legislative environments, makes it difficult for local cities to really put together an on the ground strategy to address persistent economic challenges in targeted communities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we know that. And so we have local control and we have local power to determine our own zones and say, hey, we can determine the economic circumstances in these areas in order to sort of achieve our public policy outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we see these impacts in north central west Long Beach, where communities are disproportionately layered with inequities in health and wealth and opportunity. And this recommendation before you is is to create a new tool, an economic development tool, that will shift this split city narrative by growing opportunity in the neighborhoods, in the targeted communities that need it'",
        "'speaker_9': 'most, which in turn benefits the overall growth of Long Beach. This is really about really taking advantage of opportunities, opportunities that we haven't taken advantage on as to our best ability. And so during the Community Conversation series, we observed a pattern at the at the three conversations in North, Central and West, a pattern in the feedback.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We asked a very simple question of what does your community need to economically thrive? And what we noticed was that everyone said the same thing. Every community said, we want access to financial institutions. And there were the West Side didn't have a bank in areas of North Long Beach, didn't have a bank.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They said, we want access to capital, as there are still many unbanked neighborhoods of our city. Residents want to be connected to resources and connected to each other. They know they want to pursue activities that will grow wealth for their families.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's universal. Everybody wants that. This includes pathways to homeownership, affordable housing and skills necessary to to, you know, to earn good paying jobs. There is a mutual concern for neighborhoods susceptibility to displacement. There were concerns about being able to walk to a neighborhood serving store on your business quarter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You could be proud of. Everybody said that. And everybody in every area of every every area of town knew which quarter they're talking about. They're talking about Santa Fe on the West Side and talking about Atlantic Avenue, North Long Beach or or PCH or Anaheim.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so to understand the need for this this special economic development, certainly circumstances, we need to take a look at the demographics of the communities. So the following maps were released early this year. In the first slide uses a dot map to show the racial economic concentrations by census tract.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So notice north central west is big red circles north central west. That's where the people of color are concentrated. And then in addition to racial, racial diversity, north, central and West have more families with young children. If you notice those circles, it shows, you know, north and central and west of areas with young families.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then you see in northwestern and southwest and neighborhoods, you'll see, based on the Cal enviro screen that these neighborhoods are also exposed to pollutants which directly impact the quality of life. The story is the same in north, central and west Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you look at the next map, which is life expectancy. The darker shaded portions of the map are shorter life expectancies, which are concentrated in north, west and central Long Beach. Let's take the next one, which is higher concentrations of lower income neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, let's do the next one, lower lower levels of higher education attainment. Let's do the next one. Draft drastically higher. The dark. The dark red is drastically higher. Levels of unemployment. These channels, the challenges that these each of these communities is facing is resounding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's laced with with you know, it's systemic and is laced with race in disinvest, disinvestment, rooting back to redlining. In other conversations, we know that it's all connected public policy. It's been the same story for generations. And and, you know, counsel and staff has done you know, they've done what they can do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we need to get really specific about when we talk about these areas that we need to break the cycle and do something specific to change the circumstances there. Because as local leaders, we have a responsibility to create policies that build strong, resilient communities and establishes basic life and dignity standards for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's essentially what what what the economic empowerment zone conversation is about. And so, um, so around the world, economic development programs leverage partnerships between public and private entities to stimulate, stimulate growth and target areas. You know, there are special economic zones in Taiwan, in Thai, in China, in India.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We know that there are state and federal programs that use incentive driven strategies to address economic inequity, such as redevelopment, which we know was ended in 2012. Right. And and we know it proved to be an effective state program, but it's subject to the same policies.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'State politics and budget challenges is everything else. RTA built affordable housing, attracting new investment. It created jobs in its project areas, and fortunately that program is gone. And when the state eliminated redevelopment and conversely accelerated its sustainability goals, it created the gap right there more demands on local communities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But they took away our biggest tool to really address it. And then we learned about the Federal Opportunity Zone program. Now, the federal program, it's really it's really about upfront infusion of capital. In fact, the first deadline for the federal opportunity zone is June.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think June 29th of this year is the first deadline in order to maximize the incentive. The next one is December 31st. So the idea is, if you can see the investment now, you ride it out for ten years and you get the maximum benefit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's a short term infused. It's not the answer for everything. And so while they do offer these these these, you know, incentives, it's not going to it's not going to save us. It's not going to save north, central and west long beaches, economic circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so economic empowerment zones could connect the dots between the opportunity zones and the state programs like EIA, PhDs and Careers and these other programs. So what could it look like? It could look like looking at a number of different incentives and key areas that we can locally control if we know that businesses in north, central west'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Long Beach have a higher failure rate and they don't typically last longer than three years. And why do we charge them a business license fee for three years? We should we should give them a shot to establish. Right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If we know that we need more access to the grocery stores, health care in banks, then we should make sure that every department that touches those things knows that this is a special economic zone and that we're going to leverage our procurement, leverage where we spend our finance, you know, where we bank to say make sure you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'place locations in those areas. So it's really taking a taking the time to really target those areas and say, what can everybody do to make it happen? If you're public works and we know that there are burgeoning business corridors, we put a lens on your budget process and say, how do you invest and make sure you're adding'",
        "'speaker_9': 'street furniture better, lighting the things that will make it safer and better for those businesses? If you're our workforce agency, how do you decentralize and make sure you focus on those areas and make sure you have these resources available?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's the idea. So in terms of, you know, sort of deviate it from my my my PowerPoint, but the idea here is I deviate a little bit. So the idea here is simple. How do we we want to give staff an opportunity to spend some time on this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We don't want to rush this. We want them to think about a place based program, just like opportunity zones, just like redevelopment, but local, using our tools, something we can put in place and keep it in place so people can plan around it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Like five years, right? Put it in place for awhile. Come back to us. Tell us what it's going to cost. Tell us you know, tell us how we're going to get it done. Tell us how we're going to draw these boundaries and targeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I got to tell you, there may be areas that are not on the big red areas that if we can figure out a special target, those we should special target those as well. So so information in summary this the idea here is about rising tide lifts all ships.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We should take advantage of the biggest opportunity we have where the majority of residents are, where the majority of growth is happening, and make sure we invest and invest in those areas and take into account the circumstances, the economic circumstances in those areas and really try to try to change the narrative.'",

I think it's an appropriate opportunity for neglected areas in the city to gain access to, you know, investment in order to revitalize neighborhoods that are probably forgotten.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My only worry with this is that this could be a potential opportunity for major corporations and larger investors to have effective tax havens and disadvantaged neighborhoods, as is the case currently with the opportunity zone that the federal government passed about a year ago when they recalled the tax code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, what we find is that, you know, outside investors who have a higher rate of access to capital moving into neighborhoods that they otherwise wouldn't be able to. And because of the opportunities that come with zones like this, you know, they they get to effectively defer their taxes for upwards of, you know, 10 to 20'",
        "'speaker_6': 'years. And in many times in statistics show instead of actually revitalizing the neighborhoods that they park their money in, they just let it sit. And it just maintains blight. And it's blight that doesn't necessarily obviously help the people that have to live in these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I live in the Wrigley area, and if you just go down the Pacific corridor, there's over 23 for lease signs up. That's I discovered that on Thursday. It could possibly be more. And clearly, these are properties that are owned by investors and businesspeople who have no desire of filling those leases.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so if there is to be a zone like this to be established in central, north and west Long Beach, I'm in agreement with it, provided that there are very stringent recommendations that are placed upon anyone that's operating in these zones.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For example, you know, 75% employment of local, you know, people in the community just I will hate to see another opportunity of something like, you know, the marijuana thing coming in again because recently, you know, you have a major corporation like Medmen come in and buy up a local dispensary for $30 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, they wouldn't have happened if there wasn't a voluntary equity program. So if things like this to happen in these areas, it needs to be mandatory equity. It shouldn't be at the discretion of the big investor.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'It's been great to get to know you through that and as well as attending the one that you hosted, the first one you hosted with Urunga at Silverado Park. I'm really excited about these programs. I think there are some incredible recommendations here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm really looking forward, especially to the ISS. I really want to see how those manifest. I think as and I was saying, there are so many great opportunities for community development. I just want to make sure that that as we move forward here that we consider, you know, the housing piece as well, that that's still something that's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that's present. I think there's some fantastic investment opportunities that are moving forward. But I think kind of to echo what's and I was saying important to keeping economic opportunities in neighborhoods is making sure that people don't get displaced and that those resources do stay with the community members and that they do get to benefit from them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know there are a lot of homeowners in these areas as well, and that's great for those who are renters looking for affordable housing or opportunities to stay in the area to benefit from these programs, I think is going to be quintessential to its success.'",

I'd like to thank you again, Councilwoman Richardson, for leading on on these important efforts.'",

So as you heard a little bit over the past three months, our organization helped to convene the nine community conversations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, we heard it during that process. We heard from over 300 residents and business owners from all over the city on what they feel they need in order to thrive. We had the privilege of knocking on doors, talking to residents, walking into businesses, hearing from business owners and about these initiatives, but more generally about economic'",
        "'speaker_8': 'inclusion. But most importantly, we listened. We listened to the single mom, aspiring entrepreneur who's working three jobs to to pay for her bills and one to save enough money to buy a food truck and open up her own taco business.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We heard from college students who were fearful that they're just not going to be enough good paying jobs in their immediate communities once they graduate. And we listened to the young family who's ready to purchase their first home and become building wealth, but just can't seem to save for that down payment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so these are the stories that we heard and through these conversations, these economic empowerment zones. And what we can really put into them was really that that reoccurring theme. And so, you know, too many families in Long Beach are feeling like they're not included or not fully benefiting from this booming economy that we have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And as we know, they're overwhelmingly and disproportionately families of color that live in west, central and north Long Beach. And while this is the reality for many of our families, I'm optimistic that if we continue to place the needs of our diverse communities at the center of our economic development efforts, we'll have a city that's more prosperous'",
        "'speaker_8': 'than ever. So establishing these economic empowerment zones in the areas of the city that need it most is a great first step toward creating a long beach, where all residents have pathways of opportunity to really reach their full potential and thrive.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'We have also made the suggestion of making folks that come directly from the LPC apprenticeship program as part of that disadvantage track. And I think that these suggestions would give this play and the community benefits program within it.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That's okay. I can. Can you repeat the question?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can repeat and I'll repeat both my question. I'll say both of them now. I want to understand what staff's definition of a third party independent coordinator means. And I also want to understand what you guys have as disadvantage worker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. So currently within the recommendation you are talking about independent third party jobs coordinator would be a coordinator that the city procured to work across all projects on on the play.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, great. I just wanted to make sure that it was very much third party, somebody that can ensure that they're working with all groups, whether it's groups that are in the audience or other ah worker center or churches that their main job is is doing that outreach and then to for targeted disadvantage worker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the comments the community members made around an individual prior to commencing work on the project graduated from LPC construction pre apprenticeship, tier one, tier two, zip code census tracts and the metro definition is very helpful and I wanted to know if that was something that was teased out on staff side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so the so the definition as.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As as.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're referring to it right now is, is not teased out on the staff side within our current project labor agreement, disadvantage means that you're at or below 70% of the lower standard of living as as per the federal definition or your pipeline from the Long Beach College pre apprenticeship program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you for that. Well, I support staff recommendations. I know you've done a lot of work at the Jack and with the building trades and with community groups. So I'll leave it to you guys to to include as much as the metro in there that we could include without it requiring to trigger anything else.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't want to trigger anything. I just want to make sure that we get as many disadvantaged workers as possible in that pipeline. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you very much. I first, Eric, I really want to. Just scream out kudos to your group, because the fact that individuals in my district, all of them feel like this is a lack of hope, I think they would have what was up here tonight and could hear this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It would give them some form of hope because the fact that most of them feel that they are all at risk and when they feel that way, that loses all hope. And tonight, you guys really hit it on the nail.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're making them feel like you do have a chance. You just need to come out and give yourself some support. Don't beat yourself down because you guys are on the right track and we're going to get this thing done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You are our brother's keeper. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And counsel.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think so. I don't think we're I don't think it's necessary, I guess, to do the staff presentation. I guess it's not going to happen. So, look, this was, you know, a little contentious, the process to get here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I'm glad that we went through that process, you know, that this recommendation went to the JAG that they were able to do, you know, evaluate these things, these three options, and then make a decision, which is all the community really wanted and which is what what you know, what we wanted.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm happy with the result that we get to test this out with the final two projects of the play. And as we go into the negotiation, the next play, I want to make sure that this you know, this will have some evidence of, you know, the benefit of having a local jobs coordinator that the community wants'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So that's good. And then I look forward to after, you know, seeing how these two projects, these two final projects go. I think, you know, the comments that Mr. Miller lifted up about disadvantaged communities makes a lot of sense to me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The more we can connect the dots on, you know, our homeless efforts, our economic inclusion efforts, in our efforts to get people to work who need it the better. So, you know, this just makes sense. And so I'm really glad to see that we've we finally gotten to this point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I support the recommendation.'",
