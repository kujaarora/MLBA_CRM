        "'speaker_5': 'The rest is history for me. You've heard it before. I'll say it again. He created a safe harbor where there was none. He taught me an appreciation of live theater. The spoken word, great playwright Neil Simon, Edward Albee, who I actually had an opportunity to meet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I stand here in complete gratitude. I know I've taken up an awful lot of time, but I would be remiss if I didn't. As a gay man living in the city of Long Beach, talk about diversity and the fact that in 1970 576, it was racy to do the Children's Hour.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I said, No. A friend of mine is retiring from teaching for 46 years. And she said, Who? And I said, Mr. Bowen. And she goes, I know, Mr. Bowden. I mean, I didn't even go to Wilson, but I totally know him.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's awesome. So you are just world renowned. So this is for you. Congratulations. And also, he was trying to be very sneaky with us by dropping the bomb of retirement last week so that we couldn't get it together for him to do any kind of celebration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But ha ha, we got you. Right. So social media was a flurry frenzy of all these secret websites trying to keep him off of it. And to make matters short, we set up a go fund me called Mr. Boden's retirement account.'",

And we, too, agree that, you know, the current drought conditions are not ideal and we absolutely do not want to see our parks browning and becoming dirty.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so thank you again for bringing this item forward. I just have a couple of slides to supplement tonight's discussion on the drought impacts to our parks and how we've kind of shifted some of our resources to address some additional watering cycles that we can provide over the course of this summer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So with that, as you all know, water is critical for a thriving landscape for parks, open spaces and medians. Properly landscaped areas result in safe playing fields, healthy trees and plants and cultivates the esthetic Long Beach residents have come to enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The department is responsible for the care and maintenance of close to 1000 acres of parklands and open spaces. And according to the California Department of Water Resources, on average, 47 inches of water is needed to sustain the vegetation in our Southern California climate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We work towards meeting the landscape need through rain and our purchased water or irrigation efforts. So far this fiscal year, we have received less than two inches of rain. Mother Nature has not been kind to us by comparison.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'During the difficult drought years of 2012 to 2016. The city received as much as 7.9 inches of rain during a drought year, almost four times as much as what we've received so far this year. And when you combine that limited rain with our budgeted $2 million irrigation line item budget, which purchases close to 21 inches of water'",
        "'speaker_8': ', we can expect only about 23 inches of water resources or 49% of plant need and recall, that's about 47 inches. So 49% of plant need. We're getting through rain and irrigation. So the next couple of slides just kind of depict in a few different ways really the severity of the drought that we find ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The blue bars on this chart represent the 47 inches of water needed to sustain plant life. That red line across is essentially shows 13 inches and that's what the city receives on average during non non drought years. So you know, outside of the drought we can expect close to 13 inches.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But really what I want to show here are those green bars. That's the actual amount of rain that we've received since 2012. And, you know, just about every year, with the exception of 2017 has been bad. But I really want to highlight 2018 less than two inches.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, that that green bar is barely legible. Next slide, please. So this chart helps to illustrate the water resources against the 40% 47 inches of plant need for the past six years. The light blue bar that you see at the bottom of all of those bars represents our irrigation budget.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you can see that that's been relatively flat since 2012, but that's despite the annual water rate increases that we've had and the new park acreage that we've added over the years. And so that limited water budget has been spread even more thin than in years past.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The dark blue bar represents the annual rainfall discussed in the previous slide, and then the green bar represents the amount of resources that the department has found over the years outside of the $2 million budget to put towards our irrigation needs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then obviously, the red there is the shortfall that we're experiencing to meet that 47 inches of water needed for our plants. Next like so over the years when annual rainfall and the department's water resources do not provide the necessary amounts of water, the department thoughtfully focuses on managing the shortfall and implements a series of short term'",
        "'speaker_8': 'strategies to help stretch the supply of water throughout the entire fiscal year. It seems like every year prior to the summer months, the department reviews water usage to date and evaluates water need through the balance of the fiscal year to determine how the remaining supply will be used.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This leads to a prioritization of water use for heavily used areas where the department essentially tears irrigation with a focus on providing those limited water resources to areas of high use and active uses, including our heavily programed park areas where we might provide, you know, some of our park programing during the summer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our sports fields receivable sites, those are the sites where people can reserve a picnic area and come and enjoy the parks, special event venues and newly developed park areas. This prioritization and touring of water resources actually began during the drought years earlier this decade and has been a way for us to manage those limited resources.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Unfortunately, as part of this hearing, though, we do experience some of the browning and dying of grass in some of those areas that are receiving less water resources. Looks like. So this is the slide that I really want to focus on because there is some good news on this slide.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And over the last few months, we've worked hard with both the city manager's office and financial management to identify both budget savings within our existing budget and one time resources to help supplement our existing water budget this year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm happy to report that we've identified a little over $800,000 in newly identified resources to put towards additional water. So what does that mean? It means we no longer need to tier the water usage this summer. We're going to have the resources to be able to now ramp up again the water not only in those heavily'",
        "'speaker_8': 'used areas, but also in those lesser use areas. So the community will see greening at our parks, sites and open spaces over the coming days and weeks. We've already begun this process of reprograming our controllers to apply these additional water cycles.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so again, we will start to see greening continuously throughout the course of the next couple weeks and summer. And then I just also want to point out that we are once again utilizing a summer reclaimed water truck that is going to help us apply needed water resources to our median trees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then lastly, I just wanted to point out a couple of our long term strategies. Obviously, this has been a historical structural shortfall that we have budgetary. And so we are working through the annual budget development process to help address this historical shortfall.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are also working with our partners such as the Water Department, to implement water conservation strategies and upgrades to some of our infrastructure and technologies that will help us better manage our limited water resources. And so that very quickly is kind of where we are right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to leave you with that. With these additional resources, we are going to be applying additional water cycles to our both high use and lower use parking in open space areas. And we will see greening coming forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That concludes my report. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I have a long list of council members. I want to speak. I just want to just say one thing. I really appreciate, obviously, the the focus on water conservation that the city has had in general. We actually lead the state on water conservation issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the top cities to have addressed particularly we had the drought with the governor and his mandates that we can implemented across the city. So I'm very appreciative of that. You know, at the same time, having, of course, parks that are not properly watered, not only cause issues with access for families, but as we know'",
        "'speaker_3': ', it causes it could cause real damage to trees, especially trees that have been in place for four decades and not receiving enough water. I'm also grateful that we were able to find the resources to make this investment. But I also just want to make sure, just to the team and particularly the parks management team, that, you know'",
        "'speaker_3': ', we shouldn't get to this point where all the trees are dying. The issue gets brought up. The council agendas are set and now we're going to fix the problem. I would much prefer that proactively we come to the council and say our trees are in jeopardy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our parks across the city are looking embarrassing and embarrassing and in very bad shape and we need a larger request. And that was done during the budget process last year when you guys came last year and said we need more, more money in the budget for watering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that was a great move and the council acted on that. But the current shape of the parks is the worst I've ever seen them, and I've never received as many complaints from our community on the on the upkeep of these parks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just I just want to ensure and I appreciate Councilman Austin greatly for kind of we've all this has been an issue for all of us. But I'm glad that you agenda is that to provide this forum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to make sure that it doesn't it should not take this type of action. We need to address this. And the second there's a problem, come to the council and we will find ways to ensuring that our trees that are our parks don't end up in the shape of the currently and including those medians.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just wanted to say that we've had a lot of concern on that. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. This is something that when Councilmember Austin let me know it was coming on the agenda, I let him know that my office has been working on this for several weeks. Many of you don't know that 70% of the acreage of the parks are in District five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Up on my screen in front of me, I have a line by line budget of Parks and Rec and what has been spent year to date. And I think one of the important things to discuss is that 800,000 didn't come from thin air.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, it was something that was budgeted for other things. And so within Parks and Rec, I appreciate that they've made the tough decisions on where to move some resources. We have a very tight budget and even considering how tight the Parks and Rec budget is and considering every single year that I have been on this Council'",
        "'speaker_0': ', additional funding has gone to Parks and Rec every year. And if you read the articles in the paper, we almost have double the funding per resident for our parks programs as other cities as the median. A median city spends just over $100 per resident and we're at 208.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we are really doing a superb job and our parks do continue to win awards. But as the mayor said, when I reached out to your office three weeks ago, it shouldn't have been. Well, we've stopped watering or we reduced water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It should have been, hey, in three weeks, we're considering some changes that are going to impact you and your district and you and the residents. And here's what we propose. Can we get some input? Do we need to agenda?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is this where are we? Here's what our thoughts are. And those are your decisions to make it until a policy is made by this council. And so I think that will have a better perspective when it comes to Bossy this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate that. Every year Parks and Rec comes and asks. But I also want to say, and it's in my newsletter this week, that the time has come for every single park to have an advocacy group, whether it's Pan Am or Hartwell or Eldorado.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have groups of people who occasionally are super involved, and then it falls off. But one of my my big concerted efforts in this next six months is going to be an ad, an organized advocacy group at each park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've prepared some things with Park, Parks and Rec. We have had several meetings about a grid system where we could better tell each other where the issues are, because with almost a thousand acres of park and I don't I'm not sure if people really have the grasp on how big an acre is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's multiple football fields. I mean, we're talking about I mean, how many football fields in a row is it really we say, Mr. Scott.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's approximately 45,000 square feet. So I can't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so even if we start, it's great that we have all these beach cleanups. But starting. In this next six month period, we're going to park cleanups. We shouldn't be busing our children from all different parts of the district on Saturdays all the way down to the beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We appreciate the beach. We want to clean up the beach, but we have a lot of parks and rivers and lakes and duck ponds right here in the neighborhoods that people live in. And those park cleanups on the first Saturday of every month are going to be a huge, concerted effort that I hope to hear a lot'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of feedback. So please stay tuned in this week's newsletter. And we have a lot of exciting information that's taken months and months to work on. I appreciate having worked with Parks and Rec over the last few weeks, and I also appreciate Councilmember Austin for agenda laziness.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know it is frustrating and I know we can do more, but to do more we really have to be organized. And so I look forward to working hand in hand with the neighbors on on their organization, because, as Councilmember Richardson said, resources have to be shifted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can't each year know what Mother Nature is going to give us in terms of rain. And in the years like last year when they had additional funding and Parks and Rec came in under budget, what we should have done, in addition to just allocating additional money for this year's water, is we should have started a trust'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fund for water. We really should have started an idea where we can set aside a water fund for the future and buy at a different rate. So thank you so much for the work you've done, but a lot more has to be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to congratulate you and your efforts as well. And look and recognizing that we have a problem. Councilmember Austin and myself share a park. I think we're the only two districts that really have split a park and have lots of rules park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're going to be sponsoring our first concert in the park coming up in a couple of weeks. And it's you know, it's embarrassing when we're going to have our first concert in the park and it's dry. I mean, it's almost dirt out there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and we're expecting people to take their blankets and their lounge chairs out there and enjoy the music. And it's somewhat bittersweet because when we go to the park and you put your blanket down, you want to be able to enjoy the music in a nice, comfy place where it's green all around you, and this year it's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not. So I'm very glad to support this this item here we have a lot of park. I rescheduled an event at Silverado Park that I want to have outside, but when I saw the conditions of the or the grass, I think that that that there's there's no way that I can support this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we had to take it inside. And I don't want to do that. I don't want to be put in that situation to have to make that kind of decision to where I want to have an outside event and have to move it inside because of the conditions of the field.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I fully support this item and I'm glad that the staff has reviewed it and looked into it. And I agree with the councilmember Mongo that, you know, you know it it's all 2020 now. But this is something that we could look at in the future in terms of if, again, we had this opportunity to target some'",
        "'speaker_5': 'money towards water for our parks, I would certainly support that. And and on top of that, I have a lot of meetings in in the seventh District and a lot of our trees in the medians are also dying.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I had, unfortunately, the decision to make it two years ago. Daisy, Daisy tree. These deadline, we had to basically bring down a number of trees because, well, both of age and disease, but only just because of the drought.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They were just they were just not being sustainable anymore. And we had to to cut them down because of the drought. So I hope that we can turn this around. And I hope that once we get our our most project in place, that we can use some of that recycled water to go into other places in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'district that are in the city that are in desperate need of recycled water. And I hope that we will be able to do that. So thank you, Cosmo Rosser, for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Hooper. Now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I, too, would like to thank Councilmember Austin for bringing the item forward. And thank you, Mr. Scott, for the presentation. And I would also like to commend you for being reactive to at least what our office has brought to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And thank you, Mr. Owens.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, we had an emergency situation in the Stearns Park a couple of weeks ago, and you guys stepped up and and took care of it. I did speak to the city manager yesterday. We have special circumstances in some areas that might concern like a public health issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And our office would be willing to fund that, too. As I've offered to you folks before, that's going to need to have a special circumstance. I think all my colleagues have said, you know, please come to us and ask this and I think we can support you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, again, thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, thank you. I would also thank constant council members in bringing this item forward. You know, it is a serious matter and we need to address it with proactive measures. You know, because the community has, I think, been very patient and understanding, you know, with the drought restriction and the shortage.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But, you know, our parks are not looking appealing today. You know, I've seen kids in six discipline, you know, in the dirt and in the desert they pick up on it is a concerned you know I think anything we can do to help.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would really ask that we get on that as soon as possible because I was out at the park with our concert in North Long Beach, and I think afterwards it was like, what is this? It wasn't about the music is about the dirt and the dust we had there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So as soon as we can address this issue and take care of it, I want to thank the Parks and Rec for really letting us know that they are going to do something about it. And thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Again, thank you for being so proactive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing this item forward led by Councilman Austin. So thank you. And I want to just start off by saying I want to thank Steven Scott for doing the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He's had a very challenging role, although he'll never admit that because there's been a lot of changes in leadership in that department. And the the drum that's been beat for the last few years has been lack of resources, lack of resources, not by Mr. Scott.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's incredibly frustrating for those of us who go out every day and try to serve the community the best we can. I met with the former director of the department in 2016, shortly after the city auditor's office came out with recommendations through their park maintenance audit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And at the time, I requested Slash, begged, pleaded for some sort of plan moving forward in terms of what the future was going to look like for irrigation, for planting, for maintenance, and was told that that was that was forthcoming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's definitely something that we were going to be working on. To this day, we don't have a strategic plan for the maintenance of our parks and our medians. And I understand the department has gone through a lot of changes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are limited resources. I think this is one of those situations where I'm saying, how come? How can I help you? Help me? What can we do? Because we go out there and we literally get killed at every community meeting this park, which is our brand new park that we were so proud of, the right of way'",
        "'speaker_6': '. It's on the cover of the Long Beach Business Journal. It doesn't look like this. It does not look like this today. It's it's I there have been times where I've told that I've been told that medians, the plants are supposed to look dead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've literally been told these things on multiple occasions. And I'm not an expert and I've deferred to the experts on many occasions. But it's incredibly disappointing. And with all due respect to my colleague, Vice Mayor Richardson, I agree.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to shift our resources. And I know you aren't trying to say this, but I hope we're not implying we should be shifting our resources to where the programing is, because some of us who don't have a lot of programing in our parks and have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Repeatedly asked.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For more programs like we don't have afterschool programs in the third district, they were taken away over my objection, please don't. Now take the water away because we don't have an after school program. And I know that's not what you were trying to say, but what I don't want to do is pit us against each other in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'terms of what parks are, programing, what don't. This is a very political process. And look, we have programs and some parks and we don't have programs in other parks. And I would love to have an after school program in my district somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the level of programing shouldn't equate to how much resources we get in terms of irrigation. Just because I'm not offering an after school program in any of the parks in my district because that's just not available to me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Doesn't mean we should cut off irrigation for those parks because all the kids in that neighborhood have, frankly, is the grass because there is no programing in their parks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what I would.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Really like to challenge our Parks Department to do and through our city manager with the arrival of our new program director, is think strategically about what the future is going to look like, because this is a conversation that we continue to have individually as council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'PRM during our briefings, and we're able to Band-Aid situations here and there. But there's no overall space of comfort where we feel like these issues are going to be addressed proactively. Mr. Scott is aware we have a resident who emails us almost, you know, weekly about grass dying in a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's received less and less irrigation. That's a prime has been fantastic and working with us, we're probably going to have to replace the grass there to make it drought tolerant. But these piecemeal approaches, I think, are probably not the most efficient way to do it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know. I challenge our city manager to help us figure it out. But each of us individually going to the director of PRM and asking about this park or this median, asking for more water or asking for an additional plant or two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It just seems like there might be a better way for us to approach it with a more streamlined process and some level of comfort that we can have as council members in terms of what we can expect, so that when we go out to the community, we can say, here's our irrigation plan, here's the maintenance plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is consistent. It's going to remain consistent because I think this is one of the things in my personal opinion. Parks, infrastructure and public safety are the things that most residents agree on in terms of what they want in their community and so to be good in their community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think this is an area for us to really focus on. And I would I would suggest that that maybe looking at the park maintenance audit might be a good place for us to start those discussions of what the future looks like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, PRM has done an amazing job with the resources that they have. They are incredibly responsive. Kelly and Hurley are both here. They are tremendous partners to us. Their inability to be able to keep these parks and medians alive has nothing to do with them, has nothing to do with their work quality or their work performance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's an issue of resource allocation. And so I just want to make that very clear that the team is fantastic partners, they do a great job, but we should not be having to defend against dead weeds and explain to people it's the natural cycle of the plant to die and it may never grow back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just people don't believe that. So we and nor should they. So I think we need to we really need to maybe ask.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For a little.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Bit of compassion and empathy in terms of, you know, you prm you deal with PRM issues. We deal with every issue that residents are concerned about. We do the very best we can, whether they want to talk about infrastructure, public safety, parks, airports, taxes, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do our very best to bring whatever limited expertize we have on those areas to answer questions. This is a major area where every single one of us is getting hit hard. We're getting hit very hard on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there's got to be some empathy and compassion for what we do when we go out to the community and we try to convey a sense of confidence in the government that we're going to be taking care of these things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I know this is a little bit of a rant. It's not meant to be. It's this is just an issue that's very important and so timely, especially when Jack Cunningham, our chief of staff, put this in my mail to read.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the first thing I thought of when I looked at this is this park no longer looks like this. I mean, Jack's here. If you don't believe me, you can ask him. We we send multiple emails every week about this park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's true, right, Jack? Right. Yes. Okay. So, anyway, I thank you for indulging me and allowing me to share that. I think what I'm really asking for, what it boils down to is I would like to see us have a strategic plan for park maintenance and I will be asking my colleagues to support an item reflective of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the same. Should we not start to see some changes where it's not incumbent upon us individually to have these discussions one on one, where we should be talking about this broadly, how it benefits every park in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We shouldn't be shifting water from one park to another. We should be thinking about how we water all of our parks. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I want to thank Parks and Rec for also bringing forward your presentation alongside this item. You know, I don't want to to go too much. I think I'll echo the same thoughts that my colleague said, same thoughts as the mayor said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's unfortunate that our parks are in the situation that they're in. I know that there are some hard decisions that we've had to made at Kara Park. We had a historic tree that was a beautiful tree that we had to to take down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know that's been a huge impact for the community members there. I agree with the strategic plan and I want to push as I'm not sure I need to bring back another agenda item to talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But outside of a strategic plan, looking at what additional resources do we need to plan for as a city? You know, I'm not sure this is the answer, bond measures or anything like that, that we can actually invest in our parks as a whole across the board, not only for infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Water. I know that there's a countermeasure out there around reclaimed water that we need to be looking at. But just really pushing ourselves as it seems like we've done a great job reforming many things in our city and that this is the one area that we consistently come back from and that, yeah, it impacts every single district'",
        "'speaker_0': ', no matter if we have small pocket parks like Arts Park or larger parks like Bixby Park. So I look forward to seeing our parks come back green and seeing hopefully a staff report come back around the audit that was done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you. I think this has been a really good discussion. You know, it brings up the more global issues, as Councilwoman Price was mentioning, about just esthetics in our in our city. And that is the very first thing I know that we just constantly hear from our residents about on top of all of the other layers'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that we're hearing. So I agree with everyone. Everyone here, I absolutely think that we need to think a little bit more creatively and have a plan. And I appreciate as well that each of you have been so responsive to my office and the many asks that we've asked you day in and day out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A few things to think about. Absolutely. I know we have, I believe, smart irrigation in a few locations. Is that correct or what does that look like currently?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': '28 sites that are under smart or central control, kind of a combination of both. And we have 90 ready to go out to bid probably in the next three months.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And will that I'm assuming this will be included in that plan as well, just as far as maybe getting us to 100% or getting us somewhere close so we can be at a little bit more innovative and then, of course, a little bit more of course, a lot more efficient with our water usage is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have approximately 187 clocks in the parks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the the the next phase, so to speak, will get us to about 80%. We'll be able to reduce the actual total number of clocks with this program. The other thing is it takes me approximately four weeks to go out and program these clocks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've spent a large amount of staff time over the last four weeks bring these water systems were moved back out over the last two weeks to and to them as we've located water sources but the the smart controllers are the web based control allows us to do that in several hours versus four weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have prioritized that program to assist us with programing the water.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, great. And I would just a couple more things. So the National Recreation and Park Association, I've been on that website like religiously over the last six months or so, just reading about what other cities are doing. So just a food for thought for my colleagues to look at some of the cool things that other cities are'",
        "'speaker_7': 'doing and finding areas for inclusion, innovation, etc. And I know parks, I'm sure you are reading it religiously as well, but there's a lot of good stuff in there. Secondly, I'm actually kind of of the mindset that we may perhaps in this plan and I appreciate my colleagues bringing forward is possibly including our sustainability and Parks Commissions'",
        "'speaker_7': ', just to add another layer to garner some ideas from them. And we do have some new commissioners. We also have a climate action plan that could contribute to this as well. And I think it would be good to just add that to the to their agendas, just to offer some some feedback from them so I can add'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a friendly amendment for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also making this a friendly amendment include our commission's parks and Rec.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think the commissions would be great. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Awesome. I appreciate that. And thanks again for bringing this forward. And thank you park staff for your work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. A couple couple more questions that came up from the discussion. So the will be must count. Councilman Rangel brought up lbe must. So is that going to create additional opportunities for us to divert, you know, cleaned up recycled water from the L.A. River?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And is that are we going to prioritize our parks? Are they going to the parks adjacent to the river? And we thought about that. Is that an opportunity for us?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'll take a crack at that. So, yes, that is the ultimate goal. We are funded for about a $30 million project from Caltrans. And what that gets us is the building, the treatment facility, and it's really designed to treat runoff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll be creating a wetlands as well so we can store some of that water. At the moment, it won't immediately be able to use for portable like up and down the system, but that is eventually the plan. We'd love to get that into the system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are some technical capabilities with that we need to figure out with the water department.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And just so the public understands, can you just give us like three sentences on what LP must actually.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is sure will be must is a very innovative project to treat stormwater so instead of water that is dirty coming off all of our streets and dumping into the L.A. River, we would instead captured at the pump stations, bring it down to a central treatment plant, clean it up to a to a level where you can put'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it back for irrigation. And eventually we'd like to expand it to multiple phases. So we're capturing a ton of water that we can use for irrigation on the West Side, which does not have access right now to reclaimed water.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay, next about medians. So majority. All but two medians in my district have been converted to drought tolerant. I think we should maintain continue to do that. The two medians that still remain one of them will be converted to drought tolerant and the other one will not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that will be the one that will remain. And we would hope that that since we've gone through I mean, we should think about sort of rewarding converting those medians to drought tolerant. It saves money, saves water, allows us to divert to your other medians.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we should be thinking about, you know, where are councilmembers community supportive and how can we encourage and incentivize that conversion? Because I know some communities just don't like it. And I have that in my district. Some neighborhoods like the converted look, some do not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we want to be able to think about how we incentivize that because we're on this topic. I'm just going to mention the drought tolerant landscaping some some are front of some of our public buildings we should take a look at, too, like, for example, the new fire station 12.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They're drought tolerant stuff. You know, some of the love has died. The Michelle Obama library a lot of that they're drought tolerant stuff is is great so we should think about what you know how can we learn you know I mean these are within a mile of one another.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What's what's the difference? You know, is it broken? You know, are we treating it differently? Is the contract different between a public work site or a park site? But we should really think about that. And then lastly, I just wanted to touch on the comment about the strategy.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just want to clarify for Councilwoman Price the point, and I'll try to use an anecdote to to explain it maybe wasn't the best anecdote, but the point isn't, you know, what political tool can we use to get more water for my district?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The point is, you know, or you know anything about my parks or more needy or poor than other parks. The point is, everything's going to have to be on the table because there's finite resources. So we have to think about what the strategy is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If a strategy is look at parts that are utilized and say, hey, we want to make sure that if we have additional it goes to these parks over others. Those are tough conversations, but the public expects city council to have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So just to be clear about what I'd like to see, I have some of the fewest parks in the city. I get that. But if you were to ask me, I think the public would tell you some of our parks are more heavily utilized than others.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if we had additional resources to invest, I think that sort of community context of what we actually use and we care about all our parks, but some of them, some of them are a little more high profile and those we should make sure that we're paying attention to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I've got Coolidge Park, I've got the Forest Park, Ramona Park and out in Park. But Hampton and Ramona are the two sort of larger parks that majority of the programing and majority of activity takes place at. So, you know, I want to disarm anyone.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This isn't about, you know, using any political whatever the language was, political thing. This is about choices. We're going to have to make some tough choices. And I want to inform that with some sort of community mindset about what's important, some community context.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate your comments and Vice Mayor Richardson. But I'll also add that a lot of the funding and grants that are available in CDBG areas for median turnover is not available in the rest of the district. And so incentivizing is great, but a benefit given to those who abide by a program that exists.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We don't use we haven't used CDBG for our conversions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. But there are other programs too like this that with Mary Knight, maybe not in your district. And and under her leadership, there was money available for median exchanges, and they were not available to not one median in the fifth District.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so just to ensure that the context also around, as Councilwoman Pryce talked about every day in Hartwell Park, there are there's not programing in certain areas. And there's heavily utilized areas of our parks. And so we just have to come up with a plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that in my discussions with Steve Scott, our interim director, we've talked a lot about how this plan, how we're going to have a strategic plan for the department, how we're specifically going to talk about long term maintenance goals and how those discussions will be better had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Once we have the feedback from the RFP that's out right now, that puts any of the contractors that provide that maintenance into a objective and standards based contract, which we have not had in the city ever to due to the fact that we're hiring contractors for millions of dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there isn't a grading criteria by which they succeed or fail, where by which we would have financial penalties for contractors who don't meet our expectations because our expectations are so vague that anyone could meet them. I mean, these are serious things that our council has had to start the process on tackling, and I'm proud that it's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'taken us two years to go to RFP on that contract because we've had to have a lot of hard discussions about how small a park, how small of buckets can we break the city into to get more bidders on these contracts so that more organizations can really be at the table to provide those services?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just I only actually cued up just because I also wanted to say a big thank you to Hurley, because as the trees are dying and they are falling down in our parks, a call to your team really gets people out there quickly and in all of our interactions, our staff and our community have had with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'you and your team. And they've been very polite and informed and transparent. And I think that's one of the most important things, is honesty about what is really happening and what we need to do. And as a city, we also not only need to talk about park trees, but but city trees and median trees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot of our trees were all planted at the same time. And so if at this time we are able to turn over a third of our trees and do adopt a park programs and adopt media and programs where we could start replacing the ones that are at end of life so that five years from now, not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'everything will be an end of life. We kind of have to get out ahead of it. I think that needs to be a part of that plan. And so I look forward to working with Parks and Rec staff on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'I want to echo Councilmember Price's comments. This is a resource allocation issue. This is this the question before the council. And so tonight, we are giving our staff the resources and tools they need and the decisions making they need to to move forward and to hopefully rectify a problem that we have and have identified with with the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'maintenance of our parks. I want to just say that that there also has been a lot of new parks development. And, you know, I've benefited from that a bit in my district. And we're seeing, you know, several acres of new wetlands restoration through the the forest wetlands as well as Molina Park being developed, as well as Davenport'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Park being developed. And so Parks, I'm attentive to to to to the maintenance of those parks, but also the future of wood planning and strategic planning that we're going to have to do to make sure that we're maintaining those parks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The reason I brought this item forward was not because of my parks, particularly in my district or any particular area of the city. This is I recognize as a citywide challenge. And it's clear that all most of the council members of all, not all nine of us are facing these challenges.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And so I certainly hope that that will be the case. And I would ask for a unanimous vote here. See me. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can read your public comment here just a second on this issue. But before we do that, just to just also end on a good note as well, I just want to say obviously thank you to the staff.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And so I'm sure that that will that that will happen. And I really want to agree and I'm glad that this idea of the kind of more. Strategic thinking about how we look at our park master plan has been brought up a few times.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I support that and I think about kind of what we're doing right now in public works around around infrastructure and around the Clean Long Beach Initiative and how we're using innovation and investment and kind of strategic conversations to really drive that, I think, in a way that the city hasn't done in the past.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that a similar approach to our park system could really see a great impact. And and I want to know it we haven't said it tonight, but, you know, yes, we're having all these issues. But again, the Parks Department and our parks were ranked as one of the best park systems through the walk score list'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that comes out every year as far as being walkable and being accessible. And that remains true. And so we're very proud of that. Public comment. Anyone come forward? Then we're going to go to public comment, general public comment after this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Larry, you do. I think this council can take great confidence and. In the fact that Hurley Own is involved in this. I've known Hurley since 19. In the early 1980s. And you will not find a more diligent, more competent individual.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that department should understand that. Notwithstanding that, let me make this suggestion. Obviously, I like green, lush grass as well as a lawn to lay down and have a picnic on. But there's some other alternatives, i.e. in the water boating in the Marine Stadium.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there are if recreational needs are not met on land, come down to the Marine Stadium. We have ample selection of opportunities, notwithstanding the destruction of the criminal the criminal conduct of our mayor and taking down to us and his complicit fellow travelers that will be going to prison.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are opportunities there that the Marine Stadium and the other boating dynamics can provide. If you're used to parks, don't meet up, are not currently up to your standards. But as I said, I have no hesitation. I have no question whatsoever that if Hurley is involved in the issue, we could not find a better individual in helping'",

So I'm glad the city council has gone back and forth on this several times. I wanted to say, first of all, to Councilman Pryce, that I actually really liked the standing desk and I hope to see that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'used more in offices across America and in schools, etc., etc.. So thank you, I guess for sort of introducing that to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The very progressive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, there you go. You got to take what you can get, I think. And so I'll I'll one that I'll extend my hand on that. All I wanted to say that there is a lot of money available to the city if it if money is a problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we all know that parks are also an economic driver, so they create economic value. We put a lot of money into our parks, but where does that money go? Of course, the park itself doesn't have any rental value because it's public property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You can't do anything private with it in the sense of income, but the value of parks actually spreads around into a catchment area around the parks. So areas with nice parks tend to rent for more money on any kind of catchment area could capture some of this value, which is essentially windfall gains for private owners, mainly banks'",
        "'speaker_5': '. We're not talking, you know, homeowners really in the city we're talking about in London banks, any kind of catchment plan could capture most of that public value and redistribute it to other areas of the city. And then you could have plenty of money to fund your parks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, there's actually been studies done by Stiglitz, who actually won the Nobel Prize for four for this theorem, that the exact amount of money you put in to public investment shows itself in land value. And if you tax that land value, you can sustainably fund public investment, which is a really cool concept.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Joseph Stiglitz, again a Nobel laureate, observed that this isn't strange. We already have catchment areas in Beaumont. Shaw, for example, they funded their beautification project using that, but that was from from parking. But it's a similar economic concept.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city can do that. Another thing I encourage is to spread the funds around to the city. So there's this back and forth between what areas are might be getting more of the resources, maybe excuse me, getting more of the resources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One way to deal with that is to capture some of this value and actually spread it to different parts of the city instead of letting it stay in one area. If one part captures a lot of value, send it over to a different district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That can be easily done. Another thing that could be done is to reduce or rather stop the tearing without tearing. You encourage every resident in the city to view parks as all our parks instead of just their park in their neighborhood, because there's no more tearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So essentially all parks get the same amount of water, get the same amount of resources based maybe on mileage, square mileage, or, you know, some even concept and is objective, easily understood, debated in a public forum, decided upon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And from there on, you can encourage maybe some of the more privileged residents who have a little more organization to know that when they're fighting for their park, they're really fighting for all the parks in the city because any funding that is increased for one park ends up going to all the parks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So those are some of the ideas that I would like to throw to the staff and to our city council. And if you have any questions about resources, I'd be happy to provide them. Thanks.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'But tonight, we have no rain enough. Well, our grass. And he is again saying to us tonight that same God, if you will consider what I consider important, I will send the rain again. But you will not have rain for quite some time.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember, just to address the first part of your statement there, there was a miscommunication in terms of us understanding what the union concerns were. We spoke with one representative and we thought we had address those concerns. And then when we spoke another to another representative, we found that there was additional concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have had several conversations to attempt to address those concerns. And primarily the outstanding issue is that the the union believes that the city should hire a secondary benefits consultant and the city should also cover the cost of that additional consultant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And let me just kind of back up and provide a little bit of history. Last year, through Emory University, Asians, the Poea negotiated a letter of agreement that allowed or gave them an avenue to hire a benefits consultant that which they would cover the cost.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that consultant would review the renewal process for the medical plan, alongside with the city's benefit consultant, a client. And through that process, some of the other union groups also participated in that process with them. They the unions did not opt to go that route this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I understand that they have raised a concern recently, and they would like the city to, as I indicated, hire a secondary consultant and cover the cost of that secondary consultant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let me ask you this. Did the procurement of an initial consultant by some of the labor groups result in any cost savings for the city?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the the process where we use the additional consultant identified some areas that where we could save money but also identified additional costs. And in our other plan, the PPO plan. So they identified savings in the HMO and they were projecting save additional costs in the PPO plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our consultant took a look at those projections and also provided feedback. There was different methodology used between both of the consultants. I think that's where some of the differences were. But ultimately, the city did achieve savings, primarily with our consultant negotiating with Anthem, the provider that took place over a series of months.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So so there was some additional efficiency finding efforts that were not funded by the city, but did result in the city realizing some benefits, financial benefits.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I think that's a little difficult for me to say that it was just solely based on the secondary consultant. I think it would be fair to say that it was as a result of the Alliance consultant negotiating directly with Anthem and also as a as a result of the city's buying power, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in addition to that, if you recall, in August, we had an issue with Anthem and Memorial Care, and that garnered a lot of publicity and it impacted could have impacted a number of our employees. So that also gave us leverage to negotiate a further reduction in the rates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in your opinion, what is the downside of having a secondary review at this point, if that's what the labor organization is asking for? What's the downside to the city?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have I have conveyed to the unions, if they choose to continue the pilot program an additional year based on the terms that we negotiated with them and this council approved meaning that the union would pay for the consultant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We would be supportive of that process. My understanding is that they've opted not to do that and they are seeking for the city to cover the costs. My concern initially with with that proposal would be that there would the city would be paying for duplicate services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I understand that concern. So I have a proposal that's possibly a compromise, and I'd ask my colleagues to support it. So by way of motion, I would be requesting our city auditor to conduct a review of the proposed contract with Alliant Insurance Services for Health Care, Employee Benefits, Consulting and Actuarial Services, and to report back to'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Can we get a second on that? I'm sorry. This is part of the part of the motion that you're making, right? Okay. So there's a motion in a second to that customer. Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I want to thank Councilmember Price for bringing this motion forward. And I do have some comments around the process. You know, we asked for a meeting to happen two weeks ago and typically is not what I like to do behind the rail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we asked for a process two weeks ago and we had, you know, lots of back and forth and different stories about what meetings were canceled, who canceled where, what miscommunication there were. And it seemed like a hot potato.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And meanwhile, my staff spent the entire day trying to track down what really happened and what the real concerns were. And having, you know, as Councilmember Price mentioned, the last meeting, we were told one thing, that an organization was okay with the vote and then found out later that they, in fact, were not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I have a real concern with the process and the way that this was handled. And so as we move forward, I think outside of having our city auditor do this, we need a process that ensures that before something like this is brought back to council, that everybody is on the same page so that we're not all'",
        "'speaker_0': 'running around trying to track down the truth somewhere in between everybody's stories. I would like to make sure that we have power to fire all the unions if there's something like this coming forward that when we get a word from our director of h.r.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So it's something as major as this, you know, with a contract that could go out six years. I just want to make sure that there's process and oversight. And so ensuring that we do have the city auditor take a look at this, I think that's a right decision because we're not going to be kicking the can down'",

        "'speaker_5': 'It's been the past four weeks. Then there was an issue that we should potentially be selecting a separate vendor instead of alliance that seemed to get put to bed and then something came up back again on Friday. So I do want to say this has been a very moving target.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to say everything that you've heard from our h.r. Director has been true. She's given you up to date information. What has happened is different sides. The story has changed as other people went back and different unions are talking to each other and stuff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Alex has been on the phone with the unions today to see what happened and which story has changed and who's changing their mind and all that. So it is very, very fluid. So it's shifted again, even though it's been four weeks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It shifted to late last Friday for a meeting with the unions to discuss what's before us tonight with the extra consultant. So basically, I do want to point out that we can certainly talk about, you know, coming back with a consultant or something.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I do want to know that let you know that we're saving approximately we're spending about $11,000 extra per month by not assuming this contract. So this past four weeks has cost us 11,000. And as we continue to go, we're not achieving the savings that we negotiated through Alex with this contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Parkin.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I'm just looking at for actually clarification of the substitute motion and what is being asked of the city auditor. Are we approving this contract and you're asking the auditor to look at this evening? Is that the recommendation or you want to wait on taking action on this to have her review?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not sure what she's reviewing or you having her look at the benefits of having a second company who duplicates the efforts to some extent, possibly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, my my motion was to have her conduct a review of the proposed contract that's before us tonight that we're not approving. It would remain proposed with Alliant Insurance Services for health care, employee benefits, consulting and Actuarial Services, and report back to the City Council in order to provide assurances that the agreement or proposed contract is fully'",
        "'speaker_6': 'evaluated and provided to all parties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So your statement, if I am sorry, I don't I just wanna make sure I understand. But to so the audit would be out of the RFP process itself, not the actual contract that was written.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The actual proposed contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The contract would be me would we reviewed by me. If you if you're looking at an audit of the process, I think the auditor may be the appropriate partner. So I'm not I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for in the contract or the order to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, certainly the other can look at whatever you wanted to look at, but yeah, the legal document would be mine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure, sure. And I understand that. And I guess maybe I should be clear. I'm not asking that the city auditor evaluate the legal terms of the contract, but that she evaluate the terms of the contract as they relate to health care, employee benefits, consulting and actuarial services, and to provide for us to us in terms of whether'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or not there have been look, we've just heard from Alex that others have retained or procured services from others at the at their own costs to evaluate these contracts and come back with recommendations that have saved the city money.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I understand that it's costing us $11,000. But my understanding, unless I'm wrong, is that the last review that was done by a different Labor organization resulted in savings for the city that were far in excess of $11,000 or $22,000 or whatever it may be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That may be wrong. That may be wrong. I see the city manager shaking his head. This is not a conversation that we should be. If I'm wrong, then then maybe I'll just turn it over to the city manager to answer on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm just going to go with what Mr. Vasquez said, that certainly the Keenan group was a very, very substantial group and they gave options for a client to work with. But honestly, Anthem would have never come to the table for any of the things that Alliant wanted or Keenan wanted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unless we have that that tragedy between Anthem and Memorial Care last year that opened the door for us for a client to do some heavy duty negotiating. So Alliant did the negotiating. And I'm we're certainly going to take input from any group that provides advice and stuff but we're alliance save the day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I get that and let me just reiterate because maybe that part wasn't clear. I have no issues with Alliant. I, I started my comments with commending our director for the excellent work of the RFP process. What we're trying to do is bridge a gap here between a labor organization who feels that there could be additional reviews'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of this contract to identify efficiencies and practices that maybe we have not identified that could save the city money. And I'm hearing the city say we don't believe that's necessary. We believe that's due flip duplicative and we're not willing to pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my compromise and the city auditor is okay with this is to have the city auditor take a look at some of those elements and components and make sure that we are basically having a second set of eyes on the services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That we are procuring through.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Alliant for, for this contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's, it's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a long contract. We're talking about the costs of the monthly cost to us right now, but we're looking at a multiyear contract. And I just don't know, other than the $11,000, what the downside of having the city auditor take a look at it and make sure we're getting the the best possible deal that we can in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the most efficient way that we can. I don't know what the downside of that is, if, in fact, it might bridge a gap between our employees and the city. Because, frankly, I'll be quite honest, I don't feel like the communication story is good right now because I feel a little bit of pushback in just expressing concerns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If I may. So just for again, I'm sorry, clarification, but if we're asking the auditor to look at basically the scope of. Work to make sure that nothing was left out of the proposal or nothing should be added to that so that a client is looking at everything that they, the auditor, believes should be included.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that a fair summary?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me ask the councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's correct. And, you know, Councilwoman Pierce has seconded this motion, so I'd like her to weigh in if she wants to clarify the scope of the audit by the city auditor, because I certainly don't want to speak for her as the secretary of the motion, so I'll turn it over to her.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Customer Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. I just for me, I seconded this because I feel like we've got the two studies and what we would like. What I would like to see is the auditor, take a look at both of those studies and compare them and give us that feedback.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She could also audit the process and maybe it's between both her and your office. But the fact is that we have two different studies. Instead of going out and having a third study to have our auditor give us a breakdown where those discrepancies and are there other cost savings and is this the best?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does she advise us on on taking a yes vote on this contract?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I, I follow the last part. Does she advise taking a yes vote on the contract? What I don't follow is that we have two studies. We have an RFP and we have a process that is being recommended tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I understand that you would like the auditor to take a look at what that process and what that recommendation includes to to therefore, you hear from the auditor whether her office believes it's a it's a good move forward or that something else should be maybe added or it should be started over, whatever her recommendation be is'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Yeah. So I was looking at both what the city has and what the policy has. That study that they took a look at and that we're comparing all the documents that we have around this around this contract. So I think what you've said is, yes, it's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll go with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think also and I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It shows how how complicated some of this stuff is. And to put it in front of council to vote on, we just want to make sure that we're making the right vote. So it's not to say that that it's a bad vote or that we don't support moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's that it's a it's a big decision for us. And we want to make sure we're doing the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think just to clarify to I think it's the request is not necessarily an audit per se, but it sounds to me it's a review and some recommendations to the body as to all the information that's available that's been available through the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And certainly there have been reports that have been commissioned and completed by some of our labor groups that those would be included in her review so that it's all reviewed. And then I'm sure she will get back to this body, whether it's in a memo or at the council, just her opinion on all the information she has'",
        "'speaker_3': 'before we move forward on the contract. So I think I think that's the request, if I captured it correctly or not perfectly. And so there's a motion and a second on that request. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I'm confused. And I have a bunch of questions now. So the last. So my understanding and trying to simplify this, my understanding was last time we did this, there was a study conducted by by the Police Officers Association.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Am I right? Mr.. Mr.. WEST Okay. And this was a third party independent consultant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that study happened before the award. Was was it was given out or concurrently. When did that study happen?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alex That was after, right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that that review conducted by Keenan was conducted last year during what we call our renewal process. So that would have been in June of 2017 in preparation for finalizing our 2018 plan year rates.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Was that before Alliant was given the contract or after?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Alliant currently has the company already had they have the contract currently? Okay. We had we went out to RFP because we've had a contract with them for a number of years. And through the RFP process, Alliant was selected.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So it seems to me like the conversation here, but before I even get to that. So, so my understanding, Councilman Price, so you already had this conversation with the city auditor and she said she was okay with doing this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. I mean, where I'm trying to flesh out based on what what.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The scope of everything here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is saying, because it's a moving thing. And I get it what we want.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But she's on board with taking a look and taking it. Okay. Did she talk about any cost to her? Because I know there was cost with the with the outside review. With any cost because she get it done in a month.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know. Okay. I don't know. And that's why I said 30 days. She could give us an update or, you know, if she has recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then the delay. Ms.. Vasquez, you said there was a certain amount per month delay on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. The cost of not entering into the new contract with the client, with the rates that they proposed in the RFP, would cost us $11,200 a month.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So if the last time this happened, it seems to me because both organizations reach out to our office as well and figure that it was going to be worked out. But what it seems to me is that both so everyone on the council they've spoken has said, hey, you know, we have no problem with Alliance doing'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the work. But it appears that last time there were savings, you know, 30,000 went into a study, 750,000 came back. That's that's the word. That's not necessarily the case. But folks are really, truly concerned about it. And is there any risk to this operation?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If we were to say employee groups put up the money, if savings exist, we pay the employee groups back. That way you don't start off at a deficit of $11,000 a month. And so I put that on the table to Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is that the goal here? Is it to save money and not necessarily enter into a contract when two groups are both saying the same thing?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is. But I also believe I believe our auditor can get back to us within 30 days with an update, by the way. And I do believe that it is a function that she could perform with existing resources.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Perhaps the cost of who pays for this study is something that can be negotiated into future contracts with these different groups. But I think going piecemeal with each group, when we can get that checks and balances we're looking for through the city auditor would be the best course of action.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I guess I guess what I what I'd like to do is just keep it clean. Keep it clean. Like, if there's a contract in front of us, if there's willingness on behalf of the council and the employee groups to say, commission a study and get the city attorney involved, then we just handle that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we not necessarily expose ourselves to $11,000 of being outside of the contract. And if it comes back that there are no resources, then all we did was just spend $11,000. And and this is the second time that we've inserted the city auditor into a contract bid process, the second time that we've done that kind of on'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the fly. And I really don't like the practice of doing that on the fly without the full council being engaged in that conversation. But not necessarily just, you know, some of us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, this is a good time for all of us to be involved in that, certainly because we're all here in open court. I to say open court. It's here where, you know, we're on the record. We're all talking about it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I will say, if the alternative is we just approve a contract that some people are uncomfortable with, I'm not willing to do that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's just me.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So so yeah, I don't know if I'm if I'm as interested in, you know, doing a substitute or anything like that. But I would say that I think we're not giving enough credence to just simply let's just pay for the study.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if savings come back, we should simply recoup the employee groups if they're willing to step up. And then moving forward, we negotiate that into the contract. In my opinion, that gives validation of what city staff is saying.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It gets validation with the employee groups are saying, and we don't set a new trend that we're stopping every contract, you know, the day of with, you know, information from auditors that are here and all of this other stuff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm gonna let it stew a little bit, but I may introduce a substitute, but at this point, I'm going to listen. The rest of the colleagues. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just to go back, I hear Alex stating that she does not feel that the savings were significant. And from what claims I've heard, it sounds as though there's a claim that a $26,000 study saved $750,000. But I'm hearing Alex say that that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you clarify of what you believe to be true? Or if not you, I'm sure. So during the renewal process, this happens over the course of several months. Correct, Tom? Alliant is our city benefit consultant. And they negotiate with the carriers or on our behalf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have direct communication with the carriers. In my experience, when carriers give you their initial offer, they always come in high. And so our benefits consultant, with the assistance of staff, negotiate to try to get those rates lower.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also report and work through the Hyatt Committee, which is a committee consisting a rubber representative of each of the bargaining units. And we during this renewal process, we meet monthly, if not twice a month, to go over this process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'During that process for the HMO plan, for example, in Anthem initially came in with the 15.6% rate increase. We had a round of negotiation for a 20 plan year 2018. Perfect. Okay. And we had a recap that we had received during the RFP process the prior year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that also helped us make sure that we didn't get a renewal over a certain cap during that process. As I indicated, Keynan was also reviewing the data that Anthem was using for their rate renewal. They reviewed the data independently and provided a report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Hyatt reviewed that report. Alliant also reviewed their report and provided commentary. They had different methodologies that they used. They had different assumptions that they used. So they arrived at different projections, if you will, as to what the increase should be from Anthem Justice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So one of the things that's important is just because you believe that our rate should be at a certain amount, you don't always get that rate from the carrier. As I indicated, it is a negotiation process. So I think we were all in agreement that and pointed out some important things and and Alliant agreed with those things'",
        "'speaker_0': 'as well. But at the end of the day, the final reduction that we got from Anthem was as a result of the the situation with Memorial Hospital and that then the publicity surrounding that with that Alliant was able to go in and negotiate a further reduction in the rates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So where we ended up was with the final increase of 5% on the Anthem HMO plan, which was 1.62% in in the rates and 3.38% in the ACA fees with our mandatory. I see. When you review the Kenan report of two years ago, have you explored all things that they had recommended as potential opportunities for reductions in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this next round of contracts? And are there any categories of which potentially need additional exploration? So we're going through the renewal process right now, and we certainly are going to look at any and all recommendations that were made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we also are going to go into detail with the hiring and review the process. One of the lessons learned in this whole process is that Kenan was able to provide a more detailed review of how the rates are put together by the carriers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and the hire was very much appreciative of that process. And so that's certainly something that we're going to take and we're going to apply this year with the client and go through more detail with the hiring about how the rates are developed and what goes into those rates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What are the assumptions and where are areas that we can make tweaks to reduce the rates? So are you saying that if we approved this today, which by the way, there's a typo again in our agenda which says it's a five year renewal period which our office has already reached out and I believe the RFP was three'",
        "'speaker_0': 'years. Is that accurate? So I'm not clear. Again, it adds a little bit of additional concern when our agenda items are inaccurate. Yeah, it does. Villages for that. It should be, as I indicated, a three year contract with three one year renewals for a total of up to six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I also want to point out that we do have an ability to cut to terminate the contract with a 15 day notice at any point. Okay. It just still goes a little bit to credibility. I mean, and again, I think two weeks ago, Councilmember Supernova found spelling errors of street names.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we just need to be careful and know what we're specifically talking about. So a three year contract. Okay. I'm understanding that, Councilman Pryce, you're asking for Auditor Dodd O'Dowd to look at the rates and categories that Keenan looked at to see if there are additional savings possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or efficiencies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or efficiencies, just a simple review and that she would get back to us in 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. And I believe, based on the scope of the study, it's something that can be done in-house so that we're not incurring an additional cost.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think I'm a little less confused. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks to all the questions here. And I do appreciate the constructive efforts to come up with some solutions. I do have a couple of questions. You mentioned Hayek and for our benefit and those listening at home watching, can you explain what that is and what that process is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and who is involved in the Hayek.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sure. Through the collective bargaining agreements, there is a provision that has created the Hayek, which consists of a bargaining unit representative that is a member of the health plan. We meet on a monthly basis and the Hayek reviews the proposed benefit plan and they review the renewal process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They hear reports from our carriers on utilization. They get also reports from our benefit consultants on trends and demographics and compliance issues such as the ACA and other things that impact our health plan. Ultimately, what the Hayek does do is they develop a recommendation with regard to the health plan and any proposed changes to the plan, and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that recommendation is forwarded to City Council or excuse me, to the City Manager for review and consideration. And then we bring to the Council what the final rates are and ask council to approve those rates. And we also include the report from the Hayek that sent to the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the the and just four, four, four, the acronym stands for our Health Insurance Advisory Committee, correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Every bargaining unit sit at that table, every represented bargaining unit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Every representative has a seat at that. But not all of them necessarily attend the meetings. But yes, all the bargaining units have a seat at that committee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And the the Elia group, what would be their role in that that Hayek process is that they're consulting, helping to negotiate the the planned benefits design, whatnot, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So at the at the Hayek meeting, this staff also participate in that committee and support the committee. And the consultants also sit out, attend the meetings and provide reports or answer questions if the Hayek members have questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And so there was there was conversation regarding a potential meeting for. Right. So what is the hired process part of the collective bargaining process in itself?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in a sense in that this is the avenue per their M.O. you were they provide input on the employee benefit plan program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. And regarding that, we heard something about the Kenan report. Right. And that was an independent study, as I understand it. Who was how did we reach? How did that independent study come to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in the play? And will you agreement? There was a during negotiations they requested the ability to obtain their own benefit consultant. So through negotiations we agreed to permit that process. One of the concerns was, is that they, the consultant, in order for them to do their study, needed to have access to all employee de-identified data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We as so we as I indicated, there was a letter of agreement that permitted that with the condition that they pay for the study and that ultimately was adopted by the Council as part of their M.O. agreement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when was that agreement negotiated? It was that the last round of negotiations?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe we.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was it separate from the negotiation process?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, it was part of the negotiation process, a part of the entire M.O. negotiation process with POI.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it wasn't a well, it wasn't negotiated during the contract and wasn't like a side letter meeting confer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It wasn't negotiate. It was never. Situated during the ammunition process for their contract.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I see. And so the question before us today is whether or not a bargaining unit and I'll just say I haven't been approached or have had any conversations with any bargaining unit regarding this. So I'm being brought up to speed this evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's unfortunate. The the what's before us today is to have the city auditor do an independent review of the proposed contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor members of the Council. Yes, that's my understanding, is that the auditor would look at what is being proposed and give a recommendation on whether to move forward with what is being proposed by staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I guess that that is pretty, in my opinion, benign and it just will add some time. I'm not sure if that is from based on what I'm hearing is that that's the real intent of what is the the real rub between the bargaining unit and their desire and what is being requested here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But that said, I mean, I can certainly support it. I've seen quite a few of these transactions happen over the years, and I don't think I've ever seen one. This. This. This. Unfortunately, this. This money. But I'm looking forward to support this and looking forward to the the auditors review and recommendation and assessment of the RFP here'",
        "'speaker_8': '. But at the same time, you know, if the Keenan report was an independent audit, I I'm having a little trouble understanding how the city auditor is an independent voice in this matter as well. So. But I'll support this item just for the matter of move it, moving it forward and hopefully getting some resolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Comes from Birmingham and we've got a public comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mayor. One of the most confusing things about this whole issue here is that there was apparently some negotiation took place apart from all the other bargaining units. And there was an agreement that came with an independent with independent study that apparently the unions paid into it, but did not totally agree with what was being presented'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in terms of what the cost total cost savings would be. There's a bargaining unit that feels that there could be an additional savings that could be conducted out there, that could be found if we had a, quote, unquote, independent review by our city auditor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I take a little aside from from Councilman Brosnan in the sense that our city honor is not independent. Our city auditor is elected and elected to be independent. So I don't see how that can not come into play here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, we have members of the IAM present in the audience and perhaps maybe they could shed some light on this issue in terms of what they feel are the main issues in this discussion here. Before we go into into public commentary, perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be public comment. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, then I'm going to get the opportunity for them to do that at that point then as well. But I do support the motion on the floor. I think that it's one it's a review that I think needs to take place if we're especially looking at charter change, where we're going to be adding some responsibilities to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our city auditor. This is one of those points where we can have a preview, if you will, of what the city order can do in terms of clarifying those sticky issues such as these that come before us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just one question regarding before your comment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Just real briefly. I agree completely with Councilman Yarrawonga because I first of all, I don't believe the request by the organization is to have the city auditor look at it, that that was my ability to try to find some sort of compromise.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was the simplest and the least costly option. So I don't even know. I haven't communicated with them if that's acceptable to them. But what I what I'm hearing is there is a breakdown in the process. It's not unusual.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I get it. Sometimes labor and management interests are at odds. This to me seems like a very simple ask. I could be completely misunderstanding the issue. I don't know. But they're basically saying we want another form of checks and balances before we sign this contract to make sure we're getting the best deal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because if there's money on the table that can go back to the city, it could benefit the organization, it could benefit the labor groups. That's what I'm hearing. And we're kind of put in this place now where, you know, we're making.'",

And I will say, when we negotiate contracts, the council relies a lot on staff's opinion and we defer a lot to staff's opinions when we're talking about salary and things like that.

Why wouldn't we allow ourselves the opportunity to learn that information before we approve the contract, if we can do it in 30 days?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that with that out and absolutely, the city auditor is 1,000% independent from this body. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor Richardson. And then, Miguel, the public are excellent. Thank you. Public comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Richard Suarez. I represent the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. There was a lot of debate. First of all, I'd like to thank all the everyone involved for taking this matter. I believe this is a serious issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd like to just make some clarifications on the Keenan group. Was an independent body hired by three labor organizations, the Peoria Fire and the IAM, the Kenan Group presented a proposal, if you will, that was significantly less in the area of increases that the Alliance group had presented.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was only after we shared that information with city management, that city management and I can't speak to the process, but it was after the discovery that there was a less expensive raid out there. City management came back and said, there's a savings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, the characterization this evening is that that savings came about came about as a result of a previous snafu with Memorial Hospital. And that was the the genesis, if you will, for creating that savings. What I would respectfully ask is, well, why wasn't that option sought after prior to the initial proposal?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was significantly higher. But be that as it may, the city manager believes that that savings came about. That hook, if you will, came about as a result of them owing us something in the final analysis. The Keenan group presented savings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Whether those savings to Councilman Price assertion are 700,000 or 100,000 or 50,000. There are savings. And since our members and I say feel safe to say that the members of the PRA fire and every other labor organization participate in those premiums.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We believe that a review by what has been suggested by the city auditor and independent review would be a non damaging non cost issue. So I stand before you this evening to simply say that we're talking about a significant amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I again, thank the body for bringing this issue up and hopefully I'll address your concerns. If there are any questions, I'll be more than happy to address them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Suarez. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think my my comment will be just on the grassroots level. I spent a little time in human resources on the private level. So I understand what it means to have a human resource manager. I understand what it means to have a city manager.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I understand what an auditor does. The first thing I recognized when I saw that and I read through recommendations to adopt specific specifications and awarded a contract to Alliant Insurance Services of Newport Beach. That was the first red flag.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the papers or journals that I read here whenever they're available, is a Long Beach business journal where you go through all the accolades of who these people are and what they offer. Long Beach. And they have I mean, you have everything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I thought, well, we're going to add Newport Beach. Newport Beach is going to provide consulting services for them. But in my opinion, I'm saying why we're going out there, but we always say go beach. You mean there's nobody in Long Beach that can do this for this city?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It just said to me and I'm thinking, look how much money we pay that city manager. But we're questioning his judgment. And if Lord Dowd, her position as auditor is so important, why isn't she brought in on everything of this magnitude?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why don't you bring her in? Is she? If she is your go to person when the rubber meets the road, why are you wasting time to bring it here? You listening to this? And I. I have a few alphabets behind my name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It makes me think I'm hearing something I should not be hearing at a public meeting. This kind of decision should have been made behind closed doors. This is nothing we needed to hear. It is an embarrassment. We shouldn't be hearing it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a city manager. And Laura, I paid attention to, I don't know, the woman. We've shaken hands maybe once in passing. But I've heard of her accolades. I've heard of the awards that you give her. So you trust her judgment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So now you're going to hold up the city. Again. I think we're hearing something we shouldn't be hearing. And I'm hoping that after tonight or whenever that vote is cast and if you wait this kind of thing, we shouldn't here again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is something that you take behind closed doors and you settle the issues. What it's saying to me as a public person is you've lost trust with somebody. You're not you're not addressing that elephant in the room.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And the last speaker. And then we'll go back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think you're my new best friend. My name is Trent Bryson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Born and raised.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Here in Long Beach, we have a local business that's been there since 1969. My father grew up in Rigley, went to Long Beach PI along with State. I have two kids at Long Beach Poly Stanford Middle School, and I'm an adjunct professor in human resources at Long Beach State.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our business was named Entrepreneur of the Year in 2017. We're a local broker. Seven people put in there. There are peace. Three people were chosen as finalists. Not one was local. We weren't even asked to be a finalist.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In fact, not one of our references was called. We are told the reason we didn't get is we didn't have the experience to deal with the city. Guess who had the city of the city along with his contract all through the eighties and nineties?'",

So instead, we continue to give money to a client who's actually based out of Greenwich, Connecticut, and we give them money and we have somebody outside representing us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then when I ask what happened? Why don't we get a shot? Why don't even we even be a part of the fair process? Nobody has any answers for us. So what I'd say is we're right here. If we're good enough to to run the Boys and Girls Clubs of Long Beach, if we're good enough to be'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Entrepreneur of the year, for good enough.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To be ranked by our peers as top advisors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the country, for good enough to teach human resources in Long Beach State. Where are we good enough to even have a shot at City of Long Beach? Doesn't make any sense. Half my employees live in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I live in Park Estates. We're based on Bixby and 36th Street. We help all of our companies that we represent raise money, bring money into Long Beach. We support our community over and over again. And then when we finally put our bid in, we don't even get a chance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I don't know the process that you continue to talk about. I will say as an advisor. An extra 11,200 because you haven't signed a contract doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense because you're paying $140,000 in transition assistance anyways.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So whatever you're being told sounds to me like a scare tactic. I don't know all the everything that's happening, but it doesn't make sense. The rates are negotiated with the health insurance company. This contract is for who's your consultant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Why would this contract affect your rates? It doesn't make any sense. So I think you guys need to get the bottom of it. And that's just from a resident on that part. That's not even from a business owner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But as a resident and a business owner that lives here, something doesn't make sense and it feels like they're just renewing a contract because that's the contract that's always been there. And I'd say, why not ask somebody who's local that's shown that they can do the work and that's proven themselves over and over again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thanks for your time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks. So it's just a couple of things that, you know, that I have to acknowledge. So two things, really. So, one, while I do trust and believe, Councilwoman Pryce, about the commitments from Ms.. Dowd, I know that she has no motivation, no reason to misrepresent those motivations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe that the process and the targeted processes, if we're going to commit that office and based on our experience, it typically you know, typically the staff internally does basic stuff and they contract out the real financial analysis.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I just last time this came up, Ms.. Dale came up and said, Yeah, I would hire a contractor. It would take me more than 30 days. So if I heard from her that 30 days is here and will cost me no cost, then that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The second part is truly just the integrity and integrity of the negotiation process. Frankly, when these issues were arise, have when these issues came up before the council meeting and I know they came up because they came you know, they got to me today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Frankly, we should have the council or whoever that was raised. We should have asked staff to kick this back for a week because this process is a messy if we've kicked it back for a week to allow them allow them to one, identify if there are resources to conduct a study and two, or to reach out to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'employee groups. I think the council wouldn't be bickering or going back and forth about this process. Frankly, it should just be cleaner. And so what I think is I just have a couple of questions. So. Mr.. So, Mr. West, do you can you identify the funding to conduct this third party study?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is that possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If directed to find the funding? We certainly would, yes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Can that happen within seven days? Yes. Okay. And can you sit down with the unions within seven days? Yes. Okay. Well, I'd like to propose that we just push this back for seven days. Is a council meeting in seven days?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'City attorney. City city manager says he can identify the 26,000, whatever it is for the third party study. That also gives us time to hear from the city auditor. And then there can be a recommendation that comes back from city staff that says either we go with a third party, third party recommendation from whatever this group is'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that costs 26,000. Or we hear from the city auditor from her lips that, you know, she can conduct the same study, you know, for the same amount of money or less in the same time frame. And that will make me more comfortable in this process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so I'm going to council and price that's either going to be a friendly amendment or a substantive motion. That's really your choice. Well, I don't want to put you in that position. I'm going to make it a substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're making a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Substitute. I'll just make it a. I don't. I honestly don't. I know that you feel very strongly about the contract piece. I hope the one week allows us to work some of that out so we don't have to vote on a contract that we're not on board with.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I honestly don't want to put you in that position. So I'll just say I just want to put this as an alternative to the body. It seems like there's a second, and I want to offer that as an alternative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's fine. I would accept it as a friendly to you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, then we'll go that way. We'll take it a friendly if you don't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just don't want to vote on the contract.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I understand. I understand. I just think this will be cleaner. A cleaner process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So we have a we essentially have the the proposed friendly. So that's the motion on the floor. It's currently there. Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I think I think just the overall and we've been hearing it is just the trust on both ends, both from our employee groups and of course from our public and our businesses. And I know Councilmember Mongo and I have been working on the Long Beach Business First Plan and in that and I know John GROSS, if'",
        "'speaker_7': 'you sat down with us and talked about that plan and we we really want to hit that point again, and I understand if if all the checks are not hit in terms of businesses, not, you know, hitting that criteria, but it seems like they would and have before and it seems that they would be a good, you'",
        "'speaker_7': 'know, option not to, you know, just say it would be him. But just in general, I think this is a really good example of sort of breaking down that trust with our with our businesses. And then in the employee group section, you know, I, I think, you know, they were pretty loud and clear as to not I'",
        "'speaker_7': 'mean, even getting the information from them, from all of them was a bit unclear. And it was just really unsettling to me that we had this in front of us and there wasn't a lot of answer our questions or I'm sorry, answers to our questions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I like the the direction this is headed. I will say just kind of food for thought down the road is that if we do find that there is an issue with the process, that perhaps there needs to be an annual review when we have these contracts, you know, whether it's the three years or what have you'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, it feels like there needs to be an additional layer every single year somehow, whether that's simultaneously with the city attorney's office and the city auditor's office. But it just seems like that would build a bit more trust on that end.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to echo the comments of Councilman Gonzalez and. I guess, additional months of transition. Is that supposed to be the fact that we were supposed to approve this four weeks ago and 140,000? The word transition in there at all seems surprising since it's the current contractor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just a thought on another item on the agenda and how the word how it's worded, because you're you're transitioning from the same provider to the same provider.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just a thought.'",
