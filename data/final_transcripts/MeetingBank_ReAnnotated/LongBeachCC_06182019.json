    "Denouncement of Anti-Abortion Laws in Georgia and Alabama and Related Actions.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'We're taking a couple of items out of order per a request from council. We're going to begin with item 24, which I believe we have most folks here for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Item 24 is communication from Councilmember Pearce. Councilwoman Praise. Council Member Councilman Austin. Council Member Richardson. Recommendation to support the denouncement of HB 481 and HB 314 and authorize city managers to suspend all travel contracts from the states of Georgia and Alabama so long as the bills become law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me go and begin by turning this over to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. Thank you to all the women and men and organizations who have fought for health care, for all the women and men that came before us in the sixties and the seventies to make sure that women like me had access to affordable, safe resources.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This item is here before us today because at a national level, there's an organized effort to take away the rights of women, to make decisions for themselves, the rights to health care, to economic dependance, the right to choice.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are many stories that are true. Women across age, race and class have been. Oppressed whenever states have decided to take away their rights to affordable health care, such as abortion. There are already levels that exist. Barriers that exist to getting access to abortions in states where it is legal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so when we have states like these that have decided to try to roll back the efforts of so many before us, I felt, and I believe my colleagues felt, that it was necessary for Long Beach to take a stand and say, we are a pro-choice city and we will spend our resources where we see fit in'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Spending our resources in states that continue to take away the rights to health care is not a priority of this city. So I'm happy today to have many people signed onto this item, many people in the audience to support this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wanted to remind us that Roe versus Wade was done in 1973. Before 1973, we had a high number of women having children that were put into foster homes, high number of women having children that they had to leave behind, a high number of women that were having abortions that were unsafe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Many women died. And so we want to make sure that nationally, we don't let that happen again, that nationally we continue to make progress not only in California, but as a nation. So I look forward to hearing my council colleagues comments, but I'm really proud to stand with Planned Parenthood, proud to stand with women, and look forward'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to hearing from everyone here in the audience. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I want to thank council member Pierce for bringing this item forward. Obviously, it's a very timely item and it's one that I think the city of Long Beach should take a strong stance in support of support of the item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do not believe that we should be using city funds and public moneys to support policies in other states that are taking steps backwards. Since 1973, the law has been settled and the law has been clear in allowing women choices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we cannot allow for progress in states that are trying to take those choices away to continue to thrive. We have to stand firm as a community in supporting the right of women to choose how they want to care for their bodies, what choices make sense for them in their lives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is their choice. It is their bodies. And we should, as a community and as a society, support that. I strongly support this item. I thank my colleague for bringing it forward. It is not the time in 2019 for us to take a step back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is time for us to continue to take steps forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank my colleagues, especially Councilmember. Janine Pearce in price I that's a tongue twister sometimes. The many community organizations that are signed on in support of this. Obviously the recent legislative actions in Georgia and Alabama are seeking to turn the clock back and divide our country further.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think tonight Long Beach is taking a stand to show that we are a pro Troy City, progressive city, and we won't support backward steps. This is a moral dilemma, in my opinion, because in my opinion, it is immoral to bring in an unwanted child into this world, this hard, cold world where it's tough enough for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'those even with advantages if a child is unwanted. The world is in brought into this world. The deck is automatically stacked against them. They are coming into this world, possibly without love, without support of a family. And if they are poor and of color, then inequity is even much greater.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Policies that create more foster children, more prison pipelines, more social ills are our policies that we can ill afford to support. And lastly, I think we should not be criminalizing women who are standing up and making decisions for their own reproductive rights.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I'm happy that this has has come before us. I'm glad to see that our city and hopefully will take a stand on this. I'm happy to support. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you, Councilmember Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. I'd also like to thank my council persons like, you know, Jeanine and by Mrs. Pierce both the two PS but I like to let you know that this is I really want to say that this is an album about freedom of choice and the barriers that brain places by institutions that no business get'",
        "'speaker_9': 'involved. You know, in a personal matter, I have four daughters and a wife and I'm supporting this item for their rights and for women just like them. I hope that this sends a message to Alabama, Georgia, and I hope the California stay out of making legislative stimulus to this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, vice mayor. And before I go back to cancer prepares to close closest allies add I mentioned some of this I think earlier today but I'll say that we should always, always under under all circumstances stand with women and their ability to make every choice about their body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Every health care choice that they that they would like to make is their right and their right only. I think it's also important for the city to go on record and and and recognizing that abortion is health care and that that is part of a women's that is part of women's health care is the ability to make'",
        "'speaker_0': 'those types of choices and be very clear and vocal about those when we can be. I want to thank especially Councilwoman Janine Pearce, who thoughtfully worked with our Planned Parenthood group, affiliate groups, as well as Zoe Nicholson, and now and some of the other groups that are involved in in women's rights.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know our our Long Beach breast feeding group as well. So I just want to thank the women's organizations within the city that are leading this fight. And and like I said, as an as a male, as a as a as an ally, that's a man.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, again, say to all the men that we have no business being involved in women's decisions about their body and just mind your own business and stick to yourself. So. And so I strongly, strongly support support this. And I want to thank the other council members as well that signed on and Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a really public comment and then we'll wrap it up. So if there's any public comment, please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. I have to apologize at the start. I'm not used to wearing a hat and chamber. It feels very odd. My name is Zoe Nicholson. I live in Rose Park. I happen to love Long Beach. I'm very grateful to all who are here today to stop the band.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Councilmembers in particular. Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Pierce. Councilman Austin. And whose Air Force? I forgot. Oh, Rex, she's not here. That's why I can't see it. You might find it interesting. That is the same 13 states, 13 that have not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, that are now closing in on the strictest abortion bans.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think that's a coincidence. I think it's about universal respect. No disrespect for those women in those states. For me, in fact, this is not about abortion at all. It is about seeing women as full human beings, capable, responsible members of society, not appendages or ancillary to men.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Women. All women are my family and therefore my responsibility. It is not just my obligation, but my privilege to share the safety and protections we are awarded here in California. Just because women are in Arizona or Alabama and not in California does not exempt us from caring and sharing a public outrage as we are tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Recently, I've heard Mr. Mayor talk quite a bit about Long Beach being the same size as Atlanta. I want to tell you that if a woman wanted to have an abortion here, there's a whole list of places she could go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some close, some far, but all available in Atlanta, the same size as Long Beach. There is one, and that one is under siege. The bogus heartbeat bill is being passed by all male committees. I don't even understand what they're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They don't understand how birth control works or what the criteria is for second or third term abortions. Even making laws, assuring rapists visitation with children, which is so unthinkable. These are the same legislators who are in favor of sending living, breathing children to internment camps, and they are now reporting death tolls like it's a war.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These same men are collecting data on the menstrual cycles of the girls being held in those internment camps and ordering arbitrary vaginal probes or requiring a three day wait, making it impossible without threatening jobs and privacy. I understand that we are here rallying about stopping the bans, which we don't have here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the fact is it is our obligation and fundamentally it is our privilege to raise our voices for those who cannot. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name is Karen Ayres. I'm vice president of Hollywood now, and I'm a resident of the city of West Hollywood. I'm here today because Long Beach speaks to me, is a is a place that is primed to pass the resolution you have before you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'West Hollywood has come forward and embraced its identity publicly as a pro-choice city. I think Long Beach can be the same and bigger. And Long Beach is a fantastic city. The residents here are so warm and welcoming. I think they are representative of the nation and that the majority of the people here and in our country support'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a woman's right to choose. And I commend the five council members who came forward to support this resolution and and are taking a stand to protect a woman's right to choose. Councilmember Austin, a few of those comments you've made have really resonated with me, particularly with regards to children in foster care.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as you know, Southern California has a huge population of children and youth in foster care today. I am a CASA volunteer. I work with a youth in foster care who told me that when he and his girlfriend needed Planned Parenthood, they were there for him.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He said that if a if he didn't have Planned Parenthood, he felt his life would have been ruined. And his biggest fear was to bring a child into the world that he couldn't support and to put a child through what he had gone through six years in the foster care system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's real. What you're doing is meaningful. And I commend you and taking your stance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, Mayor and honorable council members. My name is John Erickson. I am the director of Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood Advocacy Project, Los Angeles County Action Fund. We have a health center right here in Long Beach. And I want to say thank you very much to the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Counsel for considering supporting this resolution tonight. I am hopeful it passes and we join here in Long Beach where the rest of the cities, Los Angeles, West Hollywood, the county of Los Angeles, LAUSD, and multiple cities that are coming aboard here in Southern California and staying.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We won't go back. Enough is enough and we stand with women. I want you to picture it. It's 1973. Roe v Wade was decided by 7 to 2 at the United States Supreme Court. 7 to 2 when we're so used to decisions that are coming about five, four, 4 to 5.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we saw last summer with the appointment of Justice Kavanaugh was now being held up, and that promise is being upheld right now with the challenges directly to Roe that we're facing. 73% of Americans do not support overturning Roe v Wade.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is the highest statistic that that statistic has been of its time. 73%, two thirds of Americans believe a woman has a fundamental right to access to reproductive freedom in deciding her reproductive future. Additionally, right now in these states, 25 million women of reproductive age would face desolate areas where no reproductive health care would be available.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Should Roe v Wade be overturned? 25 million women. The economic impacts of that alone are daunting, scary. And it's because places like Long Beach, places like other cities here in Los Angeles and the county of Los Angeles and everywhere we can call home are taking a stand and saying, enough is enough.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you for standing with Planned Parenthood. And I want to say we got your back because you got our back. And we want to thank Councilmember Janine Pearce, Councilwoman Susie Price, Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Austin, Councilmember Richardson, Councilmember Andrews, I hope the rest of the council signs on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to this really important resolution, because right now we're on that. We're on the future, the cusp of the future, and we could see Roe v Wade overturned in our lifetime. And I know the children in this end in the United States, as well as the children in the audience and their parents do not want to see a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'generation of where we have to go back to the horror stories that many of us have heard about and maybe have even experienced firsthand about when a woman's reproductive freedoms are taken away from her. So thank you very much for this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And before I do the next speaker, I'm going to go ahead and close the speakers list. So we have our last speaker there and then our speakers list will be closed, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hi. My name is Carolyn Weathers. I'm a member. I live in the first district. I'm 79 years old. And when I lived in Texas in the sixties before, while abortion was still illegal, I was in my twenties and a friend of mine was in her twenties.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She was gang raped by seven men. She could not get an abortion, so she would tell us we would get together at our house and we would have coffee and we would talk about it. And all she could do is say, Oh, I hope I can learn to love this baby.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's all she could do. How she could learn to love this baby that seven men had gang raped her to make her pregnant with. She committed suicide. She committed suicide. And she was maligned by the city. Her grave.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Was wrecked. So I came out here in the sixties to do the counterculture, the hippie stuff, and I marched for Roe versus Wade. I was out in the streets marching for it, protesting, pushing for it, and thank God it happened.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I never dreamed in my wildest imagination that we would be coming to this point. There would be so many people trying to push us back to what I remember, the horror stories, and they would happen again. If it's not happening here, it's happening in other places.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Let us stand up and not go backwards. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi, my name is Mariella Salgado. I am a Parks Rec commissioner and a small business owner. More importantly, I'm a mother of two daughters. And one of the reasons why I come before you. I just wanted to say it's important that we think about this from a perspective of where we put our dollars matters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to thank you all for. I want to thank you and respect and commend you for taking this action and saying that where our dollars go in contracts matters. So I just wanted to say that, and I truly appreciate and commend you guys for taking this step forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, councilman. Councilwoman. Mayor, I'm glad to be here for a couple moments because in my life with my wife, we went through a problem of getting rid of her, getting an abortion back in the early seventies before Roe versus Wade.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had to sneak around and find somebody who would do it and hope that it turned out okay. And that was a tried and true situation. More for her than for me, of course. But from that I learned a lot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one of the things I do whenever I talk about this, I say to other men, you know, this is our issue, too. And if we think we can ignore this issue or we can stay silent or we can let those who are against abortion take control of our perhaps daughters or granddaughters or great granddaughters and cause'",
        "'speaker_6': 'them to be treated like like like really animals and not even have the right to say, oh, no, I control my own health and my body. Then we as men are letting women down. And this is our our species.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we have got to stand together and we can't let people tell us, oh, women are less than men. Women don't have. So please, everyone support this because we need every vote so that people like in the legislature down in places like Georgia and Alabama and Arkansas and Missouri don't come to realize that there's a price they're'",
        "'speaker_6': 'going to pay now for being against women and for taking on women's right to choose and has their right to choose, not mine. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Council members. Mayor, my name is Genesis to Square. I'm an intern with Planned Parenthood's political political advocacy project. I'm here today supporting this resolution because, as we all know here, money not only is power, money in this country is also speech.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's important that the city of Long Beach and the state of California uses their money to show that we are on the front of this issue, that we are here supporting women's rights, trans men's rights and the rights of all people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I ask you to stand with us today, stand with Planned Parenthood, stand with the women of Long.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Beach, California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the country to not use this money to support states that are going to hinder these rights for other women. I think it's important for us to all be on the right side of this issue. And I asked you to stand with us today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good afternoon, Mayor Garcia and council members. I want to thank you so much. My name is Marisela Rivera. I am many things. Among them, a city commissioner. I am an activist in my community. I am a leader. I am also the founder and director of Long Beach Breastfeeds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I had the pleasure when I was a homeowner in the second district to vote for a councilman, Jeanine Pearce. I am eternally grateful that I got to vote for somebody who would bring something like this forward. And I am now a District nine resident and got to vote for Rex Richardson, who is a co-sponsor along with council'",
        "'speaker_5': 'members Susie Price and Austin. And I thank all four of you for being brave enough to put your political capital behind women, because I know that that's what this is. You know, we talk about labels and we talk about who we are and the importance of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am a mother. I am a queer woman. I am a wife. I am also incredibly privileged to have made the choice to have two abortions. Unlike most people who don't feel the need to share their medical history, I do because I am privileged.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I had the choice to continue my college education, to only give birth to the children that would come into a loving marriage fully and completely wanted and adored. I had the choice to finish my career and then leave my career at the city of Long Beach when I wanted to be a full time parents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is what feminism looks like. That is what reproductive freedom looks like. And that is what ultimately privilege looks like. Because I am a Southern Californian from a liberal family and a liberal place and was able to ask my mom for a ride.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was able to pay cash because insurance did not pay for it. I was not ostracized by my community. I wasn't shamed. It wasn't in a dark room. And unlike my grandmother and my great grandmother before me, I did not give birth to countless children because I had to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am very grateful that I live in the city of Long Beach. I'm very grateful that you are doing this. And I'm grateful for the Long Beach Breastfeeds members who showed up today and the many, many hundreds who wanted to and can't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Long Beach Breastfeeds is about equity. It is about reproductive justice and freedom from whether or not a person can get pregnant, whether or not they want to, how they birth, where they birth, and yes, also how we use our breasts and where we feed our babies.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I don't want to have a whole nother round of talking, but I have some things that I haven't said yet. One is, thank you again for sharing your stories. I grappled with the idea of sharing my story or not, but I had the privilege in Texas to go to Planned Parenthood when I was 12.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My mom took me. And my life was not normal. Obviously, if your mom's taking you Planned Parenthood at 12. But I was thankful because I had an education around reproductive rights at an early age. And so I want to share, as many women did as Roe versus Wade came up that were in power, that I to have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'had an abortion and that I want to make sure that everybody in the nation has access to their reproductive rights. I also wanted to say that I just got word that way. 31 ABC News in Huntsville is watching and looking at what Long Beach is doing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I want to make sure that we send a message not only in our vote tonight, but a clear message to the representatives in the state that doing right by all of your constituents, doing right by all of your residents, is what you were elected to do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that it is my hope that you give all your residents access to reproductive freedom, to health care, to choice, because that's what we are elected to do. And that's what this ban is trying to isolate women. So please do the right thing and hear us loud and clear.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will make sure that we continue to fight all the way till the end. I hope everyone will vote on this. Yes. Thank you.'",

I pulled this out on behalf of my colleague, Councilmember Rex Richardson, who wanted to highlight the work that's been done throughout the years in North Long Beach through the Kaiser Permanente Hospital Corporation Foundation, and what it has specifically provided.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kaiser Permanente has been supporting Long Beach, healthy eating, active living zone initiative for over six years and has invested more than $2 million into Long Beach, North Long Beach Community. The Hills Zone, as it's known, helps address the growing obesity epidemic by supporting community transformation with a goal of creating changes that support lasting health improvements for residents'",
        "'speaker_2': 'over time. Since 2012, the Hill's own initiative has resulted in several accomplishments, including installation of fitness equipment and hydration stations at Houghton Park and Coolidge Park, initiation of the now adopted and award winning North Long Beach Open Space Master Plan.'",

Where residents exchange their own grown produce. And activation of an active Hill's own youth leadership group.'",

I want to also acknowledge the public health department under the leadership of Kelley Collopy and also members of her staff for all of the'",

And then the Long Beach School District, a number of community based organizations, representatives of neighborhood associations.'",

And I think Councilmember Durango also kind of mentioned a lot of the highlights around the crop swaps, the park improvements that we've had at Highland Park and Coolidge Park with hydration stations and also fitness zones.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so there have been a number of accomplishments over the years. I also want to acknowledge Councilmember Rex Richardson, who's not here, but really was a part of the early adoption of this work. He and his staff really put in a lot of effort of convening the residents, really getting behind the work.'",

City Council in partnership with Mayor Garcia, the Conservation Corps Long Beach is proud to share that our city, Long Beach, has been selected as a innovative recycling program through the Coca-Cola'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Foundation. I'm hopeful I can get this thing straight. There you go. So as you can see on the PowerPoint slide there that we're one of seven cities that were selected in the United States, the only city, I might add, on the West Coast.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So makes Long Beach even that much more prominent in each one of the pilot programs. The grant recipients will partner with their local city government to boost recycling rates and help and inspire grassroots movement with the support of a $250,000 grant.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm sorry. All right. Maybe a third time. Oh, no, no. All right. Well, I might add, as we're waiting for this to prom. You know, this didn't work on my computer in my office. I knew this was going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's a great video that Coca-Cola put together. Thanks. Well to jumpstart. I'm going to add in here to jumpstart the Long Beach program. Earlier this year, Mary Garcia was in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Conference of Mayors.'",

So, again, the objective of this program is to receive increased recycling participation in Long Beach, particularly in areas where the rates are low and also to focus on giving up. Yeah. Okay. And also to focus on the major issue around recycling, as I think most folks around the table, around the room know'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is contamination. So our goal is to really decrease the contamination rate so that more bottles and cans are recycled and also to provide additional support to the public works department as we move this program forward. We're going to be collecting data and that data will then help the lot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Crosby, Sugar, Long Beach, along with the city of Long Beach Public Works Department to focus on two areas of most need methodologies. We're going to have our fleet in the Street Program Education Campaign with our young folks. We're going to target communities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to primarily reducing the contamination rate that really has held back recycling across the nation. So conceptual art conducted recycling at two Long Beach events. Thus far, we've been at the L.A. Pride Parade, as well as the Southern California Special Olympics at Long Beach State.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At both events be place 250 clearstream recycling bins throughout the areas and right next to trash cans to try to eliminate contamination. Corps members collected recyclables throughout the event, as well as remove trash, debris and other things to continue to call on.'",

We look at this as a great opportunity, a fantastic opportunity, engage our young folks and to focus in to support the communities and then become the environmental stewards of their own communities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, our first lead on the Street program is to train our young folks to be environmental stewards and to be committed community activators. And do you address and celebrate along beaches diversity? So we're really looking at the best ways to get out there and get the word out, which seems to have happened.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, we all recycle. It's been around for a long time, but it's time to be more deliberate recyclers. That's where we're at. So our outreach materials, we have bilingual fliers, we have our little mason jar, which is not so much for recycling, it's for reuse.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you can use that for all kinds of different things. And within the jars, there's all kinds of, you know, kind of cool recycling giveaway things, you know, stickers and magnets and fliers and also, you know, the tote bags.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But again, the idea is to reduce contamination and have more deliberate recyclers within the city of Long Beach. So on that note, thanks for having us here tonight. And, you know, we're very proud to be part of the fabric of the city of Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'This is on the West Side. You'll recognize this is just below the 405. In just a little bit east of Santa Fe, it is approximately 60,000 square feet. So it's a it's a big piece of property. It's a it's a sort of triangular shape.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And in 2001, the city of Long Beach entered into a lease with the Tanaka family to turn this space into a recreational space for the West Side residents. So currently since 2004, we've had this collaboration between the seventh District Council office and the surrounding community, various departments, including Economic Development and Parks, Rec and Marine and the Tanaka'",

And that perimeter walking trail is a great asset, particularly for our West Side livability plan and neighborhood use. And so what we're looking at is essentially that the Tanaka family had indicated that they were going to sell the property'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And we believe that if with council approval we move forward and enter into escrow, we could actually close as early as September 20th of this year. And this is really special. We're really grateful, the Tanaka family, because they could negotiate with anyone.'",

So I wanted to make this point that we negotiated a good purchase price and if zoned for other uses, it possibly could go at even a higher market value.'",

Now, we might not take 120 days to complete this due diligence, but it's likely to take at least 90. The general terms and conditions which the city attorney asks us to read into the record, this allows us some guardrails in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'terms of negotiations would be potentially a lease of ten years +25 year options to extend a base rent that's established by a fair market appraisal that we would work on together. Of course, we'd be looking at those issues of tenant improvements and what kind of capital improvements were required to make it usable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Um, Central Cha would have some termination rights, of course, if we we couldn't come to an agreement or if we do, and the capital or tenant improvements are too prohibitive from a cost standpoint. And then we would work together to all.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Similarly establish the the the plan for redevelopment. Finally, there would be an option to purchase. So that's an important piece of this is not just a lease but the option to purchase. We want council's authority to negotiate that of course, that price that that we have to repay the refuge fund.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Ratepayers who purchased these properties would be $800,000. And we would come back to you with the final terms and conditions once we've completed that, that process.

        "'speaker_2': 'John has been a real gentleman. And and I think that this is a great opportunity for a win win relationship in many other dimensions that could come from here. I know that John is looking at creating a model that can be done in other parts of the city with other nonprofits.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Obviously, this is a first step along the way and is going to require some some due diligence and some some some sweat equity to to bring it up to speed.

And so often with these very extremely grassroots organizations, we kind of struggle to find meeting spaces. Churches are open, but you got to pay $50 an hour for a staff person.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It's so important to have an organization that has the cultural competency skills to reach out to diverse communities that might be monolingual Spanish speakers, that might be dealing with issues around poverty, immigration, workforce development. And so these are oftentimes unique issues that require unique organizations that can work with with those that are some who are in fear'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of deportation, some who might be struggling with with questions around citizenship. And we know, obviously, that Central Asia, while traditionally has been a Latino serving organization, has also transitioned to really serving everyone, our African-American youth with our Cambodian population, all all families and and communities across the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that's something that I think is really significant. I also will say that I have been to many Central Asia offices over the years, and so I'm really glad that you guys are going to have a permanent home that will be yours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At least that's my hope. And I'm really glad that the city was able to partner with all of you to do that. I know that we're not done this. We're going to have some conversations over the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it's very important to support an organization that is literally changing and saving lives every single day. And I'm really proud of central chair of the board. Jessica, you and your team and I want to anyway that the city can can be there to support you will continue to do so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we've had public comment and members as we cast their votes, I do want to point out. And I want to thank Vice Mayor Andrews. I will tell you that Vice Chair Andrews has called me at least weekly about this issue for like two months or something, it seems like constantly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got to get the center chad deal done. And I know he's been on Pat West constantly as well. And so I just want to this would not have happened without Vice Mayor Andrews, his full support. And I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue.'",
