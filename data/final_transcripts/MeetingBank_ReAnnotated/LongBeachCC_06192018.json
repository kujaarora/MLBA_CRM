        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We're going to go ahead and have a pretty extensive presentation by our staff who are going to go through all of the information on community hospital. And then from there, we will go to the city council for any questions and comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then, of course, we will open it up to the public for any questions on the on the community hospital issue. Mr. WEST. Mr. Mayor, council members, we've been working on this for quite some time now, working very, very closely with memorial care, as they have chosen to close the hospital and working with them to try to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'find a new operator. We found a new operator.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'An exclusive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right to negotiate with this new operator. And with that, I'm going to turn over this presentation to John Keisler, our director of economic development, who has been leading the charge on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Effort as the hospital does belong to the city of Long Beach with a team of other folks from Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So go ahead, John.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, honorable mayor and members of the city council. I'm going to give you a quick overview of the progress since our last open study session on April 23rd. Give you an update on the seismic and PED state requirements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Talk a little bit about our due diligence process to identify a new operator and recommend some actions from the city council tonight. So in terms of our progress since the last study session, there's been a number of of important steps taken by memorial care, as well as the city, in partnership with our regulatory agencies, including the County'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Emergency Medical Services Agency Public Hearing. We testified to the State Health Committee to support Assembly Bill 2591, sponsored by Patrick O'Donnell on Arnold to delay state seismic compliance at the facility. We've conducted weekly tours of community hospital with potential operators conducted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We contracted with our architects Perkins and Will, and meet with our state regulatory agency to prepare the seismic compliance plans. We've worked with Memorial Care to renew state hospital licenses through this year through April 28th of 2019. Memorial care issued a workforce adjustment and retraining notice or a warn notice for 363 employees at community hospital, indicating the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'employment that will terminate July 3rd. And the County Board of Supervisors adopted an impact evaluation report from County Emergency Medical Services Agency for the Closure of Community Hospital. And additionally, we've completed extensive engineering, financial and operational due diligence associated with potential new operators.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A quick overview of the seismic compliance issues at Community Hospital, Long Beach Senate Bill 1953 and subsequently Senate Bill 90 require that all acute care hospitals must meet seismic regulations by June 30th of 2019, or they will be shut down.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Non-Acute care facilities are exempt from this requirement. And Memorial Care conducted a peer review that confirmed that there was an active fault at the line in the city, subsequently conducted its own third party review, which we contracted for to confirm that the fault did exist and that there was an active fault line on a portion of the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'site. The city confirmed with a state agency, the Office of Hospital Safety, on Monday, June 18th. That Memorial Care never actually submitted a plan to retrofit the facility, and that the statements regarding the feasibility of an acute care facility on the site were not attributed or attributable to our spend.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Over the past six months, city staff has worked closely with Ashford, architect Perkins in Will and the State Geological Survey to establish plans for providing acute care services in seismically safe buildings on the site. So just to review what's actually we established going on on the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this conditions report has actually been completed but that it establishes that the Alquist pre all of fault line is established there is an active fault zone identified within the AP zone, which is the red zone that you can see on the image in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've also confirmed that new development has to set back at least 50 feet away from any active fault line for hospitals in the state of California. But we've also confirmed that up to 50% of construction on safe buildings is allowed on these sites.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so in meeting with the state officials on hospital safety, the proposed solution from occupied indicates that the city or the new operator could consolidate all the acute care services that are associated with operating an emergency department in a licensed hospital in the heritage building, which is considered seismically safe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You'll see that it actually the the SPC rating, the seismic ratings that the state attributes to these buildings allows for acute care services to work in the heritage building. But we would have to move the central plant or the utilities to a seismically safe area on the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in working with our architect over the past few months, we've established a conceptual schedule for how we would go about designing and ultimately achieving approval and permitting or entitlements from the state agency. We would also need to complete a process whereby we establish the construction costs and ultimately come up with a financing plan for construction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we believe that construction, based on the design elements which we reviewed on the previous slide, could be completed sometime in near 2022 at the end of 2021. So what this means is that we still would require to complete this construction plan and achieve compliance and extension from the state of California for an extension of our deadline'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for seismic compliance. So in terms of our size, seismic situation and next steps, we would need to complete a feasibility study that demonstrates the ability to maintain an acute care facility with the essential services on the campus. We also still need to complete a cost estimate and then schematic drawings, basic drawings for the construction at the site'",
        "'speaker_7': ', and we would need to develop construction plans. It's important to note that construction level drawings cost approximately $1 million to prepare. So this is not a small endeavor. It's actually a complicated one, and we need to identify the funding sources ultimately for the construction when this is completed, when we have achieved the the objectives of the construction'",
        "'speaker_7': 'plans and have negotiated a transition plan for operations of the site, we would have to reconnect with the State Assembly Assembly Health Committee to present the new operator and the operating plan, as well as a viable seismic compliance plan prepared by our architect and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Approved by. Occupied. And we're working on advancing the slide here. So next slide. All right, one more. All right. Very good. So I'm happy that tonight we get to present to the city council and to the public a potential operator for the community future of community hospital.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In their conceptual proposal, the group Melina Wu and Network Medical Management LLC, or M.W., and proposed to operate a smaller, fully licensed hospital of approximately four beds located on the 2840.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beds used for 40.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To 40 hospital beds. My apologies. All right, we get that. All right. Great. To do this and to warrant the type of investment that's needed for this type of project, they would need a minimum of a 40 year lease at the same term that was provided previous operators at $1 a year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The hospital operator agency would operate the hospital. They currently operate seven other hospitals in the region and network medical management would manage the care contracts. They operate a very extensive independent physicians association network as well as many other administrative services that help move a hospital there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also, the partnership is exploring a potential joint venture with Cal State, Long Beach School of Gerontology and the School of Nursing. And they proposed to reconfigure portions of the hospital which actually meet the seismic standards to maintain an acute care hospital with an emergency department, 30 to 40 inpatient beds, as I mentioned, as well as the capability'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to receive advanced life support and paramedic ambulances, which is important, of course, to our police and fire departments. They would add complementary components such as independent and assisted living services, inpatient, outpatient, behavioral health services programs for potentially all inclusive care for the elderly, or space programs and medical education in conjunction with CSU, L.B., Outpatient, Medical and Surgical'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Services and a possible additional non-medical residential. They proposed a substantially higher community hospital employees. In fact, they would do that immediately to continue the expertize and training that already exists at the site. And they're requesting the city to explore financial participation in the immediate transition and then ultimately the seismic retrofit of the facility to be determined and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to be negotiated for bringing back to the council in a public meeting. So to introduce you to the members of this partnership, Molina is represented by Pacific Six and Golden Shore Clinics, which include Dr. Mario Molina, founder of Golden Shore Medical Group, and John Molina, a partner and principal of Pacific Six.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These fine gentlemen have over 30 years of experience in working in Long Beach health care, and they're the former executives of Molina health care who serve over 5 million clients and employ over 25,000 employees nationwide. Dr. Mario Molina, also as the founder of Golden Shore Medical Group, operates 17 clinics located in California across multiple counties.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And John Molina, with Pacific six, invests in real estate development partnerships and has capitalized at $100 million, invested in both nonprofit and for profit real estate ventures. Alhambra Hospital Medical Center or HMRC Health Care, is owned by Dr. Jonathan Wu, who is also the chairman of H.M.S..'",

Currently owning seven community hospitals with over 1200 beds and 7000 employees in Southern California, there's a list of those hospitals, some of them near Long Beach, and would like to add Long Beach to'",

In addition to his practice, AMD provides service in ten counties throughout California and provides management for over 650,000 members who provide services in case management claims, contracting, credentialing, finance, accounting, member services, and many other administrative tasks associated with'",
        "'speaker_7': 'hospital management. They currently serve thousands of physicians in Long Beach, as well as contracts with Golden Shore Medical Group and as well as the Accountable IPA, which is Independent Physicians Association, a large Long Beach based group. So something that that I wanted to make sure that we addressed were recent statements from Memorial Care that indicated that it'",
        "'speaker_7': 'would be impossible for Community Medical Center to comply with applicable seismic requirements for an acute care hospital due to the hospital being located on an active earthquake fault. Memorial Care suggested publicly that these conclusions were confirmed by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, or occupied and later by the city's own outside experts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was in a letter dated July 15th. Occupied has actually confirmed with staff. I was personally on the phone that they never formally received a construction plan for memorial care. Isopod also confirmed that they only comment on plans submitted for review.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it would be inappropriate for Occupy to make a statement or to confirm the statement from Memorial Care. Additionally, our city seismic expert confirmed the quality of the seismic study. It was not their job, nor did they claim to, to establish the viability of an acute care facility on the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Additionally, another statement that is important to consider with for the recommendation tonight. Memorial Care on July 15th indicated that an interim management agreement, quote, would enable the private group to benefit financially by avoiding the need to make costly safety and other improvements to the facilities that would otherwise be required.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This statement is just not true. Memorial care itself executed a 2010 management agreement with the community hospital of Long Beach, and our operator will still be responsible for making all safety improvements to the facilities. I want to make sure that I correct that the presentation says July 15th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In fact, this letter was received on June 15th. So the recommendations that staff are providing tonight to the city council for consideration is, number one, to authorize the city manager or designee to execute all documents necessary for an exclusive negotiating agreement with Molina, Wu Network, LLC or MWI, and for the lease and potential development of the property'",
        "'speaker_7': 'at Community Hospital. The use would require these or general terms and conditions to be negotiated an acute care hospital and other health care facilities at the site. A lease term of approximately 40 years or more. Rent of $1 a year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a starting point. And staffing. A good faith effort to hire current hospital employees. The negotiating period would be 180 days with up to two periods of 90 days extension. And this is important because of the aggressive schedule we have for construction and licensing that is required to operate the facility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And any due diligence would be the sole cost of the lessee. Council approval would still be required. So although Council would take this action to authorize staff to negotiate, any terms or conditions would have to come back to the City Council for final approval and of course, public review.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The second recommendation contained in this staff letter includes the authorization of the City Manager to execute all documents necessary to accept the assignment management and revenue collection for existing leases between Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Memorial Care and the existing tenants at the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As you may know, there's approximately 30 tenants out on the site in the medical office building and other parts of the facility that currently provide outpatient services. This would allow that city to take over the operations, management and security of the site during the negotiating period with NWN, and it would allow for the city to immediately negotiate'",
        "'speaker_7': 'leases with existing tenants in the medical medical office building on the site. This would include physicians as well as our sexual assault response team sought to make sure that those programs which are important to our city, continue to provide service.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Finally, the third recommendation in this action would authorize the city manager to express the city's position that maintenance of uninterrupted emergency services is critical and urging memorial care and its board to take steps necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new operator.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a choice that the Council or the city would request memorial care to establish a transition plan with NWN and avoid or limit closing the emergency room before the state established seismic deadline. Suspend the license for hospital beds or transfer responsibility for hospital operations through a management agreement to NWN and to work with area hospitals and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'partner agencies to limit the negative impacts of emergency services. Disruption to area residents identified by the county's Impact Evaluation Report. To conclude some of our next steps that we are recommending would be to enter into a negotiating period with M.W. in return to counsel for approval of negotiated terms and conditions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Continue to work with our architect, our operator and the State Ocpd to finalize the seismic retrofit plans and provide a cost estimate back to Council for construction. We also would like to return to the state legislature once we have our operating plan and our seismic plan in hand to advance legislation that would extend the seismic compliance date'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and continue our work through Pacific Gateway, our Workforce Investment Network, to provide rapid response and continue weekly meetings with community hospital staff to make sure that 100% of our staff are placed either with M.W. and or another area hospital.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then we all know that memorial care has indicated that they will cease operations of community hospital on July 3rd. But we would want to make sure that we immediately transition those operations so that the new operator can take control of community hospital, submit their change of ownership application, and achieve licensing with the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With that, I conclude my staff report and I'm happy to answer any questions. But first, I want to make sure that I introduce the Council to the spokesperson and representative of MWI, RN, Dr. Mario Molina, who's here tonight to give a brief statement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And secondly, Ray Burton, who is the chair of the Long Beach Hospital Community Foundation, to give a brief statement of support after Mr. or Dr. Molina. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Keep the hospital open. I believe we have the backing of the physicians on staff at the hospital. I think we have the backing of the nurses. I was contacted by St Mary Medical Center and they have said that they are supportive and are willing to help as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that this is a realistic plan. I've seen the plans the Perkin and will put together. They're very impressive. I think this is a very doable plan and we could submit this to ash pot and find out if we can get their approval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, my father always said there are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lots of ways to solve a problem. And I think that as we.'",

We also know that community is an incredibly important part of our health care system here in Long Beach, and that having an emergency room in East Long Beach and one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that has done so much for so many people is also critically important. It's it's really, I think, amazing to watch the community come together to support community hospital. It has been the physicians, the nurses, the folks that work there, the community members, the foundation and our our stellar staff that has, quite frankly, had to move quickly and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with very little notice to put a plan forward so that we can continue to have an operating hospital with an emergency room in in this part of of the city. And so I commend all of you for just the quick action, really much less time than anyone should should have to put this kind of proposal forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I want to thank all of you for doing that. I also want to be very clear tonight that the ball is in Memorial's court. It is up to memorial care as to whether or not we will have a open, functioning hospital for the remainder of the year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're looking forward to going into this partnership, of course, with NWN, and we're excited about the future. But we need and have asked Memorial Care formally to please work with us as a partner and the partner that they have been to ensure that the process continues and that there isn't a lapse in service that would be disruptive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'first and foremost to emergency care. It would be disruptive to our fire department and the paramedics who are trying to help people across the city. And it would be disruptive to the people that work at the hospital that are counting on these jobs for their livelihoods and that have been members of our community for a long time'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I want to clarify, there have been some remarks by some that this group doesn't have hospital management experience, which I find odd considering the group manages seven hospitals and comes with an incredible amount of experience. So I just wanted to reiterate to our staff and I know you listed them on here, but I think it's important just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to bring this home at this point home because it's been brought up a few times by by certain folks.

Healthcare operates the Alhambra Hospital Medical Center, the Anaheim Regional Medical Center, Garfield Memorial Center, the Greater El'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Monte Community Hospital. Monterey Park Hospital. Whittier Hospital Medical Center. San Gabriel Valley Medical Center and Montclair Hospital Medical Center.

        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm very grateful that we have a stellar, experienced and well-respected and regarded group in front of us that has stepped up. And as I said, we want and we know how important community hospital is to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so for that, Dr. Molina, and to the group, you have our you have our thanks for that. I also want to just note that I am concerned that I was told and I think this this body was told on a couple of occasions that that there had been some conversations, of course, that that that were that'",

Of seismic compliance, as well as the ability of an emergency room on the site due to the state regulations when it comes to seismic compliance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's something that we took as serious, and it certainly guided decisions that we made early on about the complexity of of this of this negotiation. But just to reconfirm with you, Mr. Keisler, that the ash pit is very clear to you that there actually was never any sort of formal request to actually study the seismic issues'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or to make an assessment. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. So as recently as yesterday in our regular meetings with Ashford, they confirmed that no construction plans had ever been submitted to the state for review and that they do not take a position one way or another, on and on hypotheticals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that you know, that the statements that were made by memorial care and I'm certainly those assumptions are not are not correct. And so I say that because I think that's a critical part of this conversation, is that we're all moving together as a community forward with accurate information and that we're all able to work, work'",
        "'speaker_1': ', work together in the in the future. Let me let me also just add that what's critical right now is we need to ensure that the license that the memorial court has, the ability to keep this license operating. I believe it's until April of next year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that is there. And they have every every opportunity to continue operating until April of next year if they take that decision, which we certainly encourage them to do. That would give the amount of time that's appropriate for our new operator to come in and to provide quality health care, ensure that people have their livelihood in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their jobs, and provide this important service for the eastern part of our city. And I'll tell you, quite frankly, it will take a lot of concern off of our fire chief and our fire department and our paramedic units, who are incredibly distressed about their ability to provide strong paramedic service across the city at appropriate response times.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that is something where we have been told that memorial care is considering moving on from the hospital. I believe it's July, July 3rd. That is that is something that we hope that they choose to extend or go into a management agreement quickly with our new operator or put some kind of deal in place where they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'suspend the beds and don't allow the license to actually expire. And just for the community to understand that expiration of the license is critical and changes our ability to provide consistent service. And so, again, to our partner Memorial Care, thank you for all you do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we really look forward, hopefully to working with you as we chart this course forward and with our with our hospital. And so with that, I'm going to turn this over to public comment. And then when we come back, we're going to start off with Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So please come forward for public comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. I'm Linda Chico. I'm the field deputy for Supervisor Janice Hahn. Supervisor Hahn would like to commend city staff for working so diligently to find a new operator for community hospital. She understands that this was a monumental task that was performed on an accelerated timeline.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And she thinks you for all of your hard work. The County of Los Angeles is very familiar with the respective work of the recommended operator Molina Wu Network, LLC, and Supervisor Hahn is pleased to offer her support for MWI and to transition as the new operator of Community Hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Early on it was important for Supervisor Hahn to get everyone to the table to ensure we were all on the same page and moving forward in the best interest of the community that we all serve from. That meeting, the city, County, State, Community Hospital Foundation, Memorial Hospital and California Nurses Association all agreed the closure of the hospital'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would have a detrimental impact on the residents in Long Beach and the surrounding area. This determination was underscored by a report from the County of Los Angeles Emergency Medical Services Commission, which highlighted longer travel times, longer wait times in local emergency rooms, the loss of 30 critical care beds, the loss of the only sexual assault response team'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in Long Beach, and the loss of 28 licensed psychiatric beds just to name a few. Each stakeholder at that table also committed to doing everything possible to minimize disruption and service to the community. It would be ideal if a break in service could be avoided altogether by executing an interim management agreement with service transfer by July 3rd'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or that memorial, Kirby urged to suspend their license rather than terminating it outright. Doing either would truly compliment the city and MWI n's efforts to minimize disruption in service to the greatest extent possible. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Mayor Garcia. Vice Mayor Richardson, City Council members. My name is Margaret Smith and I'm a resident of the third district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tonight I am speaking from four perspectives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First of all, as a resident of Long Beach, so I see the health care needs of our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a consumer. Secondly, as a retired health care executive who worked for many hospitals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over a 30 year career, including memorial care. So I understand their concerns about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The continued operations of community hospital on an active.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seismic fault.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I also have huge respect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the Molina's and their.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Health care expertize. Third, as a member of my family, who for 75 years owned and operated a private psychiatric hospital in Pasadena called Lawson Seniors. So I understand the importance of mental.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Health to a community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And fourth, I am now an appointee of Supervisor Janice Hahn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the L.A. County Hospitals and Health Care Delivery Commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We oversee the entire.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'L.A. County health system. So I am concerned about the broader impact of the closure of community hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From these four perspectives. I respectfully voice my concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Loss of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Emergency department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But also about the loss of the 28 mental beds, mental health beds. That is a critical component of community hospital's range of services and the loss of the sexual assault response team. The. If the community hospital closes, the next closest program is 12.1.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Miles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Away in San Pedro. If you are a victim of sexual assault in Long Beach, you should.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not have to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Travel 12 miles to San Pedro to get help. So for all of Long Beach, we need these services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So please ensure that the next operator of Community Hospital.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hopefully the Molina Food Network, maintains these critical services for all the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Residents of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good afternoon. The honorable mayor, ladies sitting City Council. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Mike for Solomonov. Like yes, I am a former chief of staff at Community Hospital. First of all, I want to thank the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mayor Garcia and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Council for all your support and help.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In this matter. I want to thank John Keisler.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who has done an. Incredible job. He has great expertize, great personality, and it's great working with you. I want to especially thank our champion councilman, Darrell Super now for his unwavering support and diligence. What a snake. Susie Price, who attended some of our meetings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank the foundation and everybody who's here. First of all, we want to welcome the Dr. John and Mario Molina, Dr. Groom and his network for all their expertize.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the hope that they give us as.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Community closes. We know that people's lives are at risk. It compromises the health and well-being of people. People lose their jobs. Livelihoods are affected. Even local businesses are affected. That's why it is imperative that we open this hospital as soon as possible to limit the consequences.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Period. A seamless transition is needed. Long Beach is a diverse city many ethnic groups, cultures and businesses. But as diverse as it is a common person, the common purpose is that we care and we help each other. If Memorial was hurting, Community would be there to help.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would hope that in the goodness of memorial care that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They would help their sister hospital get back on its feet. The world is too small and our time in this world is too little not to want to help each other.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for all your help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks so much. Thanks, Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor and city council members. My name is Sarah Patterson, and I'm speaking here tonight on behalf of Assembly Member Patrick O'Donnell's strong support and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the effort to keep.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The only East Long Beach hospital operational, Mr. O'Donnell says it is painfully clear that memorial care wants to be the only provider in town. Since announcing their intent to leave community hospital last fall, Memorial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Care radically accelerated their closure timeline again and again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Memorial Care appears to be actively working to ensure that no other entity can take over the hospital they are leaving behind. But Memorial Care cannot have it both ways. Community Hospital offers the only full service emergency room on the east side of the city, and closure would significantly impact the region's trauma care system and further strain the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'health care safety net. Memorial care has made their business decision. The rest of us are doing our part to protect the public's health and safety, save local jobs and keep community hospital open. Assembly member Patrick O'Donnell would like to thank the city and stakeholders for working diligently to find a new provider to potentially take over the hospital'",
        "'speaker_4': '. It is the expectation from Sacramento that Memorial Care will work with the city to seamlessly transition the hospital to another provider.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This should be done without any interruption in critical health care services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For these reasons, Assemblymember Patrick O'Donnell is in strong support of the Molina Wound Network, L.L.C., to run Community Hospital Long Beach. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, mayor garcia and council people and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dr. Molina needs to hear this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Too. My name is Charlene Ouray. I'm retired from Long Beach City College and Program. I was a professor there for over 35 years. And I wouldn't I didn't intend to speak tonight because I just came to support community hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what I did see was that you have mentioned Cal State University of Long Beach Nursing program. And I never heard one word about the ADN program at Long Beach City College and the students that should be attending this hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The one thing you don't know historically is that Long Beach Community Hospital has been supported by Long Beach City College nurses for over 35 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think Dr. Molina knows that. But I'm just bringing it to the board attention that that was a little slip, as much work as John has done. That was rather left out, considering that the nurses are so supportive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here are the ones from Long Beach City College. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And and even even John Cassidy is not perfect. And so we we do know. We do know that in talking to the new partners coming in, that they are very interested, of course, in working with our educational partners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, of course, that includes a one beach city college. Absolutely. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Jackie McKay. I'm an ICU nurse at Community Hospital for 33 years. And I have the privilege of working with John Keisler on the technical workforce. And I'm so grateful to all the work you guys have done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Amazing. And we're so happy that we found a new operator. I have a side hustle at community hospital, like the nurse rep for when the nurses get in trouble, they call me. I go to H.R. with them and I know firsthand how Memorial believes in rules.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They make you follow the rules. They're on you. So for them to not be completely honest is just amazingly awful to me. And I think for the council, I hope you find a way to hold their feet to the fire to make them follow their rules.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, everyone. My name is Milton Dana. I'm a third district resident, a machinist and a member of Save Community Hospital, Long Beach Coalition member. And we have been working to try to save this hospital since November. We finally get an operator who's willing to come into the site and memorial.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who do you think would be a good community partner is refusing to enter an interim agreement with a new operator. This is sad that memorial would sacrifice our community hospital for their selfish reason to keep out a competitor.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And where am I? Community Hospital.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'T-shirt today. I am frustrated and excited at the same time, excited that we have a group that is very interested in running our small hospital and providing services to East Long Beach, which is a huge population of people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Huge. I am frustrated in that it feels like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Memorial wants doesn't want the competition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And feels like I'm back out because of that. And it kind of reminds me a little bit on what's going on at the border right now. You know, it's like it's a policy change. People just change the policy and everything is can proceed much more humane.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just feel as though we are under their thumb only because they don't want the competition. Dr. Mike was saying how it's not just the patients, the community, its employees, and it's the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Surrounding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Businesses. And to that I say, what is Biggie's going to do without all of us ordering food to be delivered? Okay, this is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A big deal to them. We keep them in business. So just anything.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That we can do to keep our place open, you know that you have the support of the nurses, you have the support of the California Nurses Association, of which I am a member, and they have been instrumental in trying to help keep this hospital open.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I ask that we do the same thing and hold Memorial accountable. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. Council members and Mayor Garcia. My name is Jim de la Russo. I'm a physician. I'm kind of a newbie at community hospital. I've only been there like 20 years. I'm also an ex chief of medical staff there, as well as Dr. Mike.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I wholeheartedly support all the efforts and the recommendations that you're currently making. I, too, am very, very grateful to all of you who have clearly been very vocal in supporting community hospital when all this came down in November.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Your staff is unbelievable, John, especially the work groups that have been together, the the Community Hospital Foundation, all the local community members. I know you've gotten together many architects and other people. It's just phenomenal that all of this has been able to come together in such a short period of time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's quite remarkable. In speaking with a number of physicians at Community Hospital, I believe I can say that that I have not heard none of us have heard anybody who is opposed to any of this. We all wholeheartedly support a new operator in the Wu Molina Wu network.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it goes without saying too. We're all concerned about everybody that works at the hospital. But don't forget, many of the physicians have worked there for years and years as well, and many of them actually depend on their livelihood for that facility's care too.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I also support the mental health initiatives at the hospital. I think that would be very, very painful to lose that service. I also support the emergency room services, but also the acute care hospital is very important, including the surgical services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's where I work and it's also a big need in the community. I want to thank you for all of your support and I know that memorial will do the right thing going forward. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'My heart's racing. I'm still blown away at that seismic study and the big reveal tonight. But, you know, working for memorial, I know with memorial care, we do do a lot of good. We do do a lot of good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that the closure of CHP is a crisis. No doubt. We all know that in this room. I'm so proud of the council and the city. And I want to thank Dr. Molina and Dr. Wu and and the foundation with the generous contribution.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We're concerned we don't want to close. We're not sure what's going to happen with this heart. Patients that are raped, they shouldn't be transported to another city. And this is ridiculous. This doesn't need to be about competition. Hospitals join mergers to make profit every day, and we should be able to, even if it's on a temporary memorial'",
        "'speaker_4': 'care, should be able to work with the Molina's to to get this done for a temporary basis. I just want to. I've been looking around the room. I don't know if anyone here is is here for memorial, but I just want to appeal to my employer to do the right thing.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. My name is Michelle Pimental. I'm a registered nurse. I worked at a community hospital and the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment center. Because of their announcement and their closure, I had to leave for my own family's well-being.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I work now in Newport Beach. And because the community has closed their detox unit, I have seen patients come from Long Beach all the way to Newport Beach for substance abuse treatment. I hope that you'll include that in your mental health.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm I know I can speak for my colleagues in mental health. They are grateful to hear that Molina is considering maintaining those services. Those are critical services in this city. Most of all, I want to say thank you to everybody that has been involved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The day of their announcement, myself and Jackie and Ellen were in a meeting with the nurses union and we contacted Darryl Super Now and he came over immediately and met with us. And and in this current political environment, it's hard to know who to trust.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I've been overwhelmed and impressed with how much. Time and devotion, the city, the doctors, the community has put into saving this because this is really important. I asked my daughter to come with me today because she was there with me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She heard me making phone calls and trying to help do everything I could to get people riled up. And she came to the parade with us and she said to me on the way here, she said, Sometimes it felt like we couldn't do it, but here we are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did it. So thank you. Thank you.'",

I first of all urge you to adopt agenda item 40 580543 and I want to join the Amen chorus here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the last speakers talked about the political climate. There's a lot of cynicism about elected officials in government in this day and age. What you've done here on this issue is kind of throw a lot of cold water on that, at least as it appears applies to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You've done exactly what I think our forefathers who helped form this country had in mind when they wanted local control. And you've taken an issue and rather than take the easy way out. Oh, there is you know, we can't do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You've found a way to say yes to serve the community. Now there's just one problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Memorial care. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Somebody earlier said it I think best. They they do do a lot of good things in this community. But on this issue. They've lost their way. They've lost their moral compass on this issue. They've let, whether it's money or whatever, get in the way of doing what's best for this community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I want to commend the nurses union, the community foundations, the the people in this community who've worked with the city staff and the council to come to a good solution. And I think by doing what you're doing, you're going to help.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We're going to community. And at that time, I didn't know what a phenomenal place community was. They just and I said, Why aren't you taking her to memorial? And they said, Because she's going to die on the way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My mother did not die. I had her for another ten years and that's because we had community hospital all over the east side. Those minutes matter to a lot of people, and if we don't have that hospital, those people are going to die.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I am so grateful that the city is on our side this time. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Of Janice Hahn and. Others that we're talking in terms of regional aspects.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So forth.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can't get in or can't get in memorial, it doesn't do you any good. One of the things we might take a look at. Is entering.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Into a paradigm where we helicopter people and obviously the helicopter location.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Because even if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Memorial is if a community hospital is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There. And you can't get in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That doesn't do you any good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like last year when I had to go to and they ended up in, I went up into a Burbank.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And made it up in 57 minutes and so forth. I spent 13 days there. But I think we have to look into terms of the future because the problem's not going to get any.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lighter, so forth in terms of need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. That will conclude our public comment. So thank you all for speaking. I'm going I go back now to the council. We do have a motion and a second motion by Councilmember Supernanny, so I'm going to pass it over to him.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. At first I could thank everyone for attending and especially our speakers. I want to mention a few others. Again, Dr. Molina, thank you for and your partners for stepping up to the plate in this critical situation to the Long Beach Community Foundation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You folks have worked so hard for the past six months and to cap it off tonight with this incredible offer for $1,000,000 insurance policy. All I can say is thank you. To our nurses. Thank you. Boy, you mentioned that first meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wow, that was a long time ago, but we've been in support from day one. And thank you for holding the line and being there for the rallies and everything and and the parade. So, so happy to support you in that too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff John Kaiser I don't think you're infallible. I think you're perfect. But I also want to mention Diana Tang, who's sitting next to John there. Thank you, Diana. You did an incredible job, especially for. Sacramento and to ask or see who is part of our development services team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What he's doing there out on the site is incredible to all the volunteers who may not be a member of the foundation or whatever. Thank you. I think in particular of Ruth Lau. We have about 20,000 reasons to thank her.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you, Ruth. And also, I just have to mention the mayor and my council colleagues, you know, their support has been there from the beginning. I never had to explain to them what an asset this is, city wide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they backed me from from day one on this. So I do appreciate that. I did want John Kaiser to explain something for the viewers and the audience in particular about this handoff. If you can just kind of delineate, John, how the handoff would work or what are the pitfalls of this doesn't happen, if that's enough of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a question for you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember. Super, not yet. So. So there's something important about a transition of the hospitals that there's a a license which allows the hospital to operate at a site. Right now, the license for community hospital on the site is is held by memorial care.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Memorial Care has an active license through April 28th of 2019. So for a new operator to come in and not experience a 6 to 9 month wait, which means no service for 6 to 9 months while their application is approved by the State California Department of Public Health, we would need some sort of agreement between the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'two entities. And so that's that's one of the things that's important about any good handoff is that, you know, the time of disruption is is minimized. And so this is very common. It's something we've seen happen throughout the region.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In fact, Memorial Care participated in a similar process with community hospital Long Beach back in 2010 to minimize the amount of disruption while the new operator gets a new license for that site. And so there's many options to explore.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One would be a suspension of of the beds so that the license does not expire or is not surrendered. And that's what we've asked for memorial care to work with us. And if the memorial care board desires to work through that process, then it will allow the operator either to step in at an earlier time or at'",
        "'speaker_7': 'least minimize the length of disruption.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you for that explanation. And the dollar amounts are staggering as to whether we do a warm handoff or not. Are you at liberty to discuss any of that at all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At this time? We're we're in the initial discussions of reviewing pro formas that the operator has been preparing, as well as looking at what would be required for startup cost or transitional costs, even in the environment of a warm handoff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's there's costs associated with emergency medical records systems, which are very expensive. There's costs associated with equipment. And to the extent that memorial care could sell or lease, the existing equipment to the new operator would minimize the cost as well as minimize the disruption.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also, entering into a management agreement whereby they could operate under memorial care's license would allow them to start the process of providing service and hopefully generating revenue cash flow that will help in the transitional process. And then finally costs like an insurance policy to protect memorial care from any liability.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The fact that our community foundation members of the community will donate their own money in the amount of $1 million certainly helps to defray those costs and reduce that liability for memorial care. All of those things can help diminish startup costs, which are estimated to be depending on the type of handoff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Anywhere from ten and up to $30 million is our initial estimate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That that gets our attention. I guess I'd like to limit my comment tonight here to just one basic statement, and that is a lot of the speakers refer to the fact that memorial care may not have done the right thing to date.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my message is to memorial care. Here's your chance to save face. If you can step up and make this transition now. I think that would really reinstate the citizens faith in Memorial Memorial Care, doing the right thing for the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'd just like to hand off to my colleagues now for their comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Got some more super now, Councilwoman Bass.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I, I first, I want to thank my colleague, Councilman Super. I know we spend a lot of time up here thanking one another. You must wonder why we do that. It's because there are hours and hours of hard work that go into every item that comes before council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And every time one of our colleagues is leading on an item, we know the amount of work that they've put in behind the scenes and out of respect for one another. We try to support projects that are going on in each other's districts to the extent that that feels right to us, and we want to acknowledge the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'hard work that they've done. And he has worked really hard on this issue. That really is a city issue, but certainly an east side issue. So I want to thank him for for his partnership and his leadership on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, of course, our city staff deserves a standing ovation. I mean, they have done in three months what prior operators had not been able to do in many years. And so I'm incredibly impressed with their leadership, their tone, their sentiments and the hard work that they've put into really walking the walk and not just talking the talk'",
        "'speaker_5': ', because that's what's gotten us to this point. I myself was taken to Community E.R. two weeks ago. I had emergency spine surgery a couple of days after I went to the hospital. And it was a huge reminder to me of how important it is for us to have an emergency room on the east side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Certainly it was not a life or death situation for me, but for anyone who's ever had a ruptured herniated disk, you'll know that you're in excruciating pain and screaming the whole way. And, you know, all I just kept telling my husband is, can you please call and make sure community is still open?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you please make sure they're still open? Can you make sure there are bodies there? And we got there. Of course there was. No, wait. The staff was amazing, as they always have been in terms of my prior experience with them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it just was a very personal and timely reminder to me of this amazing asset that we have on the east side. I think the car ride for me from our house to memorial would have been excruciatingly painful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Every speed bump was felt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Every pothole was felt, every stoplight was felt. And it was for me a not a life and death situation. So I think it's really important for us to realize how important it is for us to have acute care services on the east side of Long Beach for east side residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the option for me of driving to memorial or driving to Los Alamitos. Would have been the only options I would have had had community not been open on that day. And so that was just an eye opening experience really.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that we have a potential operator here who we believe in. We believe that this operator is certainly qualified and capable and vested on many levels in the future of Long Beach. And that means a lot to us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And frankly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've worked really.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hard to get to this point. And the ball is now in Memorial's court to partner with us. I understand the reservations well to some extent, and I understand the hesitation. But at the end of the day, we've had a tremendous working relationship with Memorial up until this issue, and there's no reason why this can't be an opportunity'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for us to work together to really make sure that we preserve this asset. They know that without their help and their support, we're in a much more difficult place than we would be with their support. And so I think that knowledge alone should really empower them to do the right thing in this situation, despite the concerns that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they might have. I think, given what Ray announced Ray Burton announced earlier tonight, and the great work that the staff and the supporters of community hospital have put into coming up with mitigation options to help mitigate the risks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Associated with this partnership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that makes it a lot harder for Memorial to say no to or to turn away this opportunity. You've made it a little bit more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Beneficial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For them to participate in this transition with us. And I thank you for doing that, because it really does help us give them some further assurances.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This really is our.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Only meaningful chance right now to move forward in a smooth process and transition. And I ask Memorial really to think about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will we be able to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do it without memorial? Absolutely. Will we do it without memorial? Absolutely. We're committed to that as a council. But the issue isn't will we do it is do we have a meaningful shot at a smooth transition? And we do with and only with their partnership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I reach out to the audience and to anyone watching. Many, many people that are involved with Memorial and have helped memorial through the years. Our third district residents, I myself have helped fundraise for Memorial by participating in various fundraisers, very, very supportive of memorial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But this is the opportunity for us to try to look at a path forward and move this process to the next phase. And really, it does fall on memorial at this point to help make this transition possible. They've been a great partner and I look forward to future partnership and I thank everyone that came out, especially many'",
        "'speaker_5': 'residents from my own district who are here have been here every step of the way, fighting for community to stay open. I thank you for the countless hours that you give to this issue every day and of course, to our nurses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to just chime in and just join in on the chorus of attending a lot of council meetings in the last eight years. And I got to tell you, this is this is one for the history books.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is incredible, the response that's come together on behalf of Councilman Super. Now, the mayor, the city council, city staff here, the community coming together. This is one for the history books. Dr. Molina, I have to tell you, your values, the commitment to the community that you've demonstrated is not lost on me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's about 30 youth here in the audience that have an item coming up. And I can tell you what you've demonstrated today of growing up in a community demonstrating the community commitment through corporate responsibility. That's a message that's not left.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Don't lost on them as well. So I want to say thank you. You know, I have to I have to say a few additional things. There are a lot of great things, great things that I want to call out about this this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, one, we've identified a qualified operator with roots in the community and the right experience. That's one. We have a commitment to retain 100% of the impacted staff. This doctors, nurses and miscellaneous staff. That is wall to wall.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's two. Three. There is a willingness to work with memorial care. So those are no lapse in service that help support your paramedic services, that help support just the quality of life of residents in the East Side and citywide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then Fourth Community Hospital stood up today with the biggest surprise of the night, committing $1,000,000 to cover Memorial Corp memorial care through the transition. Those are four amazing, amazing elements of this proposal that that that really need to be applauded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All the boxes are checked, all the bases are covered. And and this has been said numerous times tonight. And I'm going to just join in in the choir, join in the chorus. The ball is in Memorial's Cares hands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've all demonstrated support from oral care. We all understand that this is a sum of all of its parts a closure of an emergency room, a closure of the hospital on one side of town. Impact services for All Long Beach and surrounding communities from Lakewood Regional is gone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's the, you know, emergency room closest to me. They're going to see impacts the emergency room, you know Long Beach Memorial and all our emergency rooms are going to see impacts. You're going to see paramedic response times increase if we don't have this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the ball is truly in their in their court. And so we ask them to step up. Demonstrate corporate responsibility and partner with us so we can have the best the best result possible. So just one of the jack to chime in and say, I'm really proud of tonight and really proud of this work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The ball is in their court. Thank you, Councilman. Super. Now, it's just been amazing to see your sort of level, hand level head, your steady hand through this whole process. And and, you know, this is just a great moment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I wanted to acknowledge that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. There are often times, whenever we sound like an echo chamber up here, and I don't think any of the times in the last two years I've been on this council have been as important as tonight. And so I want to really thank everybody that's already been mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The board members are really coming together, strategizing the staff. I echo the same sentiment when this was presented to us. My jaw dropped and that gut wrenching feeling of, oh my God, are we actually going to be able to come through on the other side and and make this a reality?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a city council member, as a mental health commissioner at the county and as a patient of community hospital, today's a really proud day. I'm really proud of the team, Dr. Molina, and everybody that stepped up. It is exciting to see somebody that has roots in the community invest back in and think creatively outside the box.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not going to take too much time. I do think that the questions that Councilmember Supernova asked that got the answer, that 10 to $30 million is the difference if memorial care doesn't step up and do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's why we are an echo chamber tonight. That's why we continue to say memorial care. This isn't about profits. This is about people. This isn't about competition. This is about saving lives. This is about saving face for some people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But this is about our residents making sure that they have access to health care, which we know has been a battle in this country for a long time. And so to leave nine months where people have to travel that much further, nine months, we're not only do they have to travel farther, but their wait times when they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get to your hospital are going to be longer. Nine months where we have nurses and doctors that don't have a place to work at that current time is just unacceptable for this city. And so while we appreciate everything that Memorial Health Care has done, today's the day that you can stand up proud, put your shoulders back and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'say, we're going to do the right thing for this city. We're going to do the right thing and continue our license to spend that license instead of letting it go. And so I'll just leave with that. And again, really, really proud of the Long Beach community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everybody that's committed their time not only in this fight, but in the decades that came before this to make sure this hospital was in existence. And I'm excited about the potential of what's going to be there. I know we've heard a lot of creative ideas and this is just the beginning, so I'm really looking forward to the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'work ahead. And again, congratulations, Zuber, and all for your leadership and everybody else. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrew. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'First of all, I want to thank you, Mayor. Mr. Super. And I just can't really tell you how much I appreciate the hard work that you put into this situation, because the fact that everything that we talked about, because remember, the members in my district and we always talk a lot about what we're trying to do and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'what we're trying to get done. But I can feel the compassion of all of the individuals out there, you know, you knowing that what you're up against and I can't see that our voices can be come back void because of the fact that this is a city that works together.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We strive together, we live together. And I think this situation with a hospital that I know that you individuals know that we are with you and this step up here. And I can't even take time to thank our city staff for the hard work they've done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But Mr. Superville, I'm telling you, you can be Superman to me, because the fact that what you're doing and what you continue to do, and I hope everyone this will work out because I can't see memo being that insensitive to your cause in the meaning to be able to keep this hospital open.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's going to be open, I tell you that. I know that. So you guys continue to work hard. And you, Dr. Merlino.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You guys are always there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is why I know these things are going to work. Thank you guys again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Tauranga.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Barry and I echo many of the comments already been said by my colleagues here. But one of the most important things that, you know, we're always faced with as elected officials is we're given a choice. You know, we do the political thing or we do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there's no question that our support of community hospital is the right thing to do. And we're asking our our colleagues at Memorial Hospital to also consider doing the right thing and not the political thing. The line that was crossed back in 2016 when this new law came into effect that basically affected community hospital, that put it'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in the condition in the position that it is today. Was unfortunate and it's political, although there are some safety issues in play here. The need to save community hospital is overwhelming. There is no question the impact that closing the community hospital would have on our entire community, not only in Long Beach, but regionally, as well as as'",
        "'speaker_10': 'was mentioned earlier. And again, when this first issue came up, know, one of the main concerns that I had was that what's going to happen to all of those 340 some plus staff that work at community hospital? What's going to happen to them?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I was very concerned that some of the plans for transitioning some of the nurses from community hospital to memorial was basically increasing the requirement. So you have 30 to 40 years of service. That community hospital is being forced, if you will, to reconsider the positions and the jobs and retire.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I want to thank Dr. Molina and his group for stepping forward and say that they will 100% accept that the step up community hospital, because that's the right thing to do. And that is one of the best proposals that I that I've come across in any transition from one company to another is having that willingness to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'take on the staff of a predecessor. So we are urging memorial care to please do the right thing and suspend the license so that we can continue this transition in keeping community hospital in service. And the young lady who mentioned Lombard City College, I was a 14 year trustee at Long Beach City College, and I went to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'many other graduations. And I know that there are many students that did their internships at community hospital and went out to get jobs here. And and I congratulate City College. I congratulate you for bringing this forward because it's we have a great city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have a great, great educational institutions here. And a few years back when Mayor Garcia and I were got voted in and we talked about the college promise and we said we going to close that loop and get the city involved.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we are we're there. And hopefully we can come out with a very positive outcome as a result of excuse me, of tonight's meeting. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would just like to extend my support as well. I think Councilmember Super and the mayor for really setting the tone ahead of time, wholeheartedly supportive of all of my my council colleagues comments. I think it's extremely important even being a councilmember from downtown, I care about the whole city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is more a city wide issue. This is no longer districts. And it really matters to many of us who, especially a person like me, I delivered at Memorial and had the best, best nurses that helped me in basically an emergency pregnancy situation that I had.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it was yeah, here at council actually from council to memorial had a child in 2 hours and but with the best staff. And so my support wholeheartedly to our nurses, to the physicians, to the administration, to all of the various unique services that we have, they're hoping to continue that and make sure that we have the'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. And Mr. City Attorney, we just need I know we have multiple actions, but can we do them all in one vote or. Okay, great. So we have all the actions that were described in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as we just go to a vote, also just to end on a on a positive note, I think on behalf of the community, just to the to the Molina and Woo Network and the group, we just want to thank you for stepping up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We look forward to many years, many, many years of a fully functional emergency room hospital with a partnership with our foundation, with incredible services for the mental health care needs of our community, as well as the important needs of Islam Beach and really the whole city in the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we're very grateful and of course, to our partners at Memorial, who I know are I'm sure are watching this hearing as well. We thank you for your partnership that we've had for many, many years, and we look forward to continuing that, especially through the process as we transition to our new partner.'",

And so our mission is here to to strengthen the leadership capacity of local leaders, to eliminate racial disparities, to heal racial divisions, and to build more equitable communities. We're excited to be here in Long Beach because we are very committed to working with cities that are very much invested in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'theory of change that the National League of Cities has built as part of our commitment to creating real. Our theory of change is, as we have invested in creating real, is that as cities, they recognize why the change is needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They also are committed to understanding the potential for what solutions are needed in the city, but also recognize the urgency which I think is very much captured in the work that we do. And so coming to here in Long Beach, one of the things we think is so important is to look at data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Data for us, it drives the work we do in cities across the country. And so when we talk about the work that the National League of Cities has done to really advance racial equity, we recognize it's not just the moral thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's good governance. You know, it's economically the right thing to do. And so that's why we're excited to be here in Long Beach. And so one of the data points that we highlighted as we came here to Long Beach was just looking at what the economic value would be as a city that is really committed to really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'advancing racial equity within your city. And so as you see here on the data, the economic value for if there was no racial gaps in income within the Long Beach area, there would be over a $500 billion increase in your economic value by addressing the racial equity implications within your city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so one of the reasons why we're here is because you as a city have recognized that you've recognized that in your economic equity summit that you launched a year ago, recognizing that as you are addressing issues of racial equity, you recognize the economic value.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so as we're working with you, we are working with you to really recognize the importance of really being able to really engage in that work and understand the importance of that. And so many of us that engage in this work recognize one of the things that's so important as we do this work with cities across this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'country is understanding the difference between equity and equality. So as we work with city leaders across the country. There is this kind of interchangeable language. And as one of the things that we do this work is recognizing just the difference.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This diagram is one of probably many versions of understanding the difference between equity and equality is looking at three people trying to watch a baseball game behind the fence. And all of them have very different needs. Right. And so as we look at issues between equity and equality, equality is giving people the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as we understand what the goals are here within the city of Long Beach, as you're thinking about your economic equity issues, how are you thinking about what your clear goals are as you are not trying to give everyone the same thing but to the right looking at what do people need right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you're defining what those goals are, recognizing where people are setting very clear goals. And our job as we're here working with the city, is both lifting up the great work that you're doing here within the city, but also figure out how we can support you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're excited to be here over the next three days, both to learn and share across the country about the work that you're doing, but also to figure out how we can support you and the city as you're committed to really driving this work forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we have been very clear in launching rail that when we launched it, we were very intentional about putting the comma between race and equity. It's called race, comma, equity and leadership. But we also recognize the reason why we're leading with race is because we've seen the data across this country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also here in Long Beach, when we look at infant mortality to life expectancy rates. This is still the strongest predictor of one's success in this country. So I'll say that again, race is still the strongest predictor of one's success in this country, whether we look at infant mortality, to education, to criminal justice, to jobs, to housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Looking at data across this country, including the data we've looked at here in Long Beach, and so how do we be very much intentional about calling that out in doing this work and how we work in collaboration with all the great work that you're doing here in this city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so our job in really advancing racial equity is to close the gaps where racial equity is no longer predicting one success in this country while improving outcomes for everyone. And so we're excited about how we take that very targeted approach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's referred to as targeted universalism being targeted in our process, but universal in our goals and recognizing that to really take this work on how do we work with you in all the great work that you're doing to really be committed to really taking on that kind of investment and really looking at the policies, the practices and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'procedures that really are committed to really being targeted in your work. And so I knew my time was really limited, so I wanted to bring a voice into the room that can say in three and a half minutes that would probably take me 30 minutes to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this was the launch of our when we launched real three and a half years ago, our CEO Clarence Anthony, really and our board charged us to really figure out what does this work look like? And so I wanted to bring the voice of Tim Wise in who serves on else's real board to really help frame'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that work, to really help kind of bring to light the things that I'm trying to really articulate here in the room. So I hope the video works. Let's see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I the tech folks in the back. Welcome to the video.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I had magical hands, I would try to do something with my magical hands. It's going to be all right for three days. Yeah. Or left. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I know that they're probably working on it. Okay. Why don't we. Why don't we keep going and. Yeah, we're working on the video, but it's. Or is there anything else that you'd like to say?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. No, thank thanks, Mayor. And so what Tim Wise really brought to light was really acknowledging the charge of being very explicit about calling out critical issues that really drive why it's important for us to do the work we're doing here in partnership with the city of Long Beach, really acknowledging the importance of looking at racial inequity'",
        "'speaker_2': ', institutional and structural racism, understanding the impacts of implicit and explicit bias. And so we're excited over the next few days that we have an opportunity to work in partnership with the council, with your leadership here, and also the agencies that are really invested in this work, that really are committed to really building on that work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so our commitment over that work is really acknowledging that what we do is both training, it's both technical assistance, it's creating opportunity, you as city leaders to be connected with others that are engaged in this space across the country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we are very much passionate about being able to connect you as peers, but also recognizing that there are a lot of intersectionality of this work. And so we are one of the things we'll be able to do while we're here is to be able to offer a training on Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we have over 80 or so that are registered for racial equity training. That will be an opportunity to really introduce a lot of the concepts around racial equity. How do we normalize a conversation on this that we hope will be a foundation to all of the great work that you're doing here in the city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we offer a range of ways of really supporting cities across the country, but we also recognize it as cities that there are a lot of different ways for you to get started. And what we have appreciated in selecting Long Beach is that there are a lot of great examples of leadership from your mayor to your council'",
        "'speaker_2': '. They're really setting the example, setting the tone, creating spaces to observe and listen to your community as you're having that dialog. But we're also looking to explore ways of of going further of what you could do in your city, whether it's making clear public declarations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city the commitment to creating the Office of Equity was an example of your commitment to recognizing the need to have a dedicated infrastructure to action. So we really appreciated seeing that that was the investment that the city was making and having it housed within the the Department of Health Health Department, as well as recognizing the need'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it needing to exist within your your executive office and having your deputy city manager being accountable for really advancing that work. So we are engaging with you, leveraging what we have seen across the city, across the country and engaging this work and are hoping to be able to bring what we can to support you in that work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as well as what we hope. And so as you see here, we've highlighted a number of examples of where racial equity is, strong examples of models that we want to lift up. And so part of what we hope to take away as we're here is to really lift up Long Beach as a model, given that it's here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in California, we have not lift up a California city yet. And so we're hoping Long Beach is the first California city that we can really lift up as an example of the work that you're doing to really advance racial equity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we're creating these profiles. As you can see here, these are four of an example of a number of profiles that we're lifting up, and we're hoping that Long Beach is another kind of profile we can lift up nationally for people to see the leadership of the work that's happening here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we excited as we are launching this work. We've been generously supported by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to launch a national learning community of cities that are committed to truth, racial healing and transformation. There have been now there's a list of 15, I think there are almost 20 now cities that have been a part of this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'network. And as you can see with listed here, Long Beach is one of six, as you've heard, that were competitively competitively selected to be a part of this National Technical Assistance Initiative and literally a diverse range of cities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're in strongly conservative cities as well as progressive cities as well in the Midwest and across the country. And so what we're excited about is how can we support the great work that's happening here in the city as you're really committed to really advancing this work going forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So really appreciate your commitment to this and recognizing that your commitment also started with your investment in the boys. Women of Color worked in My Brother's Keepers work, which was also another reason why the National League of Cities really saw this as a great opportunity to partner with the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we also recognize the intersectionality of not just boys and men of color, but a. A number of other special populations, whether we're talking about our immigrant communities, our LGBTQ, our religiously persecuted, particularly our Muslim communities, as well as women and girls.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the city here has recognized the intentionality of all of these intersections. So we're excited both to celebrate your work, but also to figure out how we can support you as you're on this journey together. So sorry the video did not work because Tim would have said a whole lot more than I could have in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'time they had together. But I'm also grateful that my a number of my team members are here. Both Bernadette O'Neill Naka and Alisa Wasserman, who is here in the crowd. Just wanted to give them a shout out as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we look forward to spending time with you over the next few days. So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Will, thank you very much for that presentation. And and thank you to the National League of Cities for for the work by Sammy Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And we had an opportunity just to meet today and I just wanted to chime in and say a couple of things. First, thank you for selecting long term. And as you have, there's written a lot. That wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Me. It's okay. We're going to we're just going to keep going with the items which are good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I wanted to say thank you for selecting Long Beach. I know that there's an incredibly diverse set of cities that you have there, and I know how difficult it has been to really have this conversation in cities that are far less diverse than Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Cities in the Deep South with with deep, deep histories of segregation. And there was a lot of tremendous healing to do in the sea to see what's been what's what's been taking place in some of those cities and see the work that's taking place in cities like Seattle and Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to know that Long Beach is in league with cities that are really having a smart, data driven conversation about really acknowledging the community that we are today and the deficits that exist and how we need to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you said this word a number of times, intentional about calling out those deficits and really creating plans to address it. Sometimes this stuff is uncomfortable. We're a very diverse city, diverse in opinions on diversity, on political points of view.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have to respect that. And we have to go about it in a way that everyone feels comfortable and sees the benefits. The fact that your first slide really highlighted economic disparities and how it's a better proposition for a city from an economic standpoint to really embrace diversity and to engage on race.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's the right move, and I think that really brings people together when you can really see that it's in the city's best interest to maintain your status as a world class city, if we think about it from a economic standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you so much for your presentation and I really look forward to the results of this work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I'd like to thank you as well. Appreciate you being here and presenting in front of the council. I think many of us on the council believe very firmly in racial equity, in making sure that we're always looking through that lens when we're making policies, whether it's park programs, whether it is any policies that we're putting in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'front of of the public, it's very imperative. And we're a very diverse city, as you mentioned, LGBTQ individuals, people with various backgrounds. We've passed a language access policy as well. And I'm just so glad to see that you're bringing this forward and that we can actually integrate our policy work together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much for making the trip.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you. Also, I want to thank the national lead for cities, for, you know, bringing your expertize to our city. You know, we're living in times where racial equality is being allowed to be ignored and this is unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I hope that as the city and we learn from your training and thank you for bringing this presentation to us. And I heard your name was Last Names and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to make the same comment. No wonder you did such a fine job. There you go. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Captain Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I could talk on equity forever, but I will try to keep it brief. I want to thank you and Leah cities for all the work that you're doing. I personally was a part of the California Department's work with so many other community members that had this discussion around bringing this conversation, specifically governing for racial equity to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Long Beach. And we really struggle with the conversation. Do we talk about equity by itself or do we talk about racial equity? And I think even in a city as progressive as Long Beach, to see us struggle with that kind of conversation just highlights the need for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think you really us having to echo that systematic racism is real and it's not calling out a person as racist, but it's calling out the systems and that sometimes it makes the conversation difficult and understanding that whenever we look at the numbers, that race is that number one decider.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I really want to thank you for coming out here, and I look forward to working with you guys in the future. And I just appreciate all the all the work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And finally comes from Ranga.'",

And I'm looking forward to showing off a wonderful facility that we had, that we work with the homeless population here in Long Beach, the villages of Cabrillo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm really looking forward to being able to show that to you, that it's a great program. It's in my district, in the seventh District, and hopefully we could take some back, some ideas as well with to share with you other cities as well as what we're doing here in Long Beach to address that issue as well'",
        "'speaker_10': '. So welcome and and looking forward to more discussions.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'How's it going? My name is tonight Convey. I'm a resident of sixth district. How you doing, Councilman? Uh, I think is a great program. If I can get out of work in time, I will be there on Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One idea this crossed my mind. An opportunity to push your agenda to help our city. Maybe we can get a citywide commemoration for Juneteenth. Today's Juneteenth. I didn't see any moment of silence or any energy put towards the the Juneteenth celebration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Juneteenth is for those that don't know, Juneteenth is a it's a holiday state holiday celebrated by 45 states in this country. And it is the official end of slavery in this country. General Granger, he led his army into Texas, which had over 500,000, sees me and over 500,000 slaves who were unaware that slavery was ended in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rest of the country. And unfortunately, they want to let it be known because there was a harvest coming up. So, you know, as is the systems that benefit to take advantage of free labor. But I think that would be a good example.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe you can bring that up on Thursday. Another one also relates to the see, maybe we can we can get some help on a change in the name of some of the streets in this the city. You know, I live on a street called BURNETT Street, and it's named after Peter BURNETT, who's the early governor here in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'California. He was also a white supremacist, and he led early settlers here in California to add segregation laws prohibiting people who look like me to settling into a free state. He also then later moved up to the Pacific Northwest and did the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now we did a great thing. We changed the name of the school in my neighborhood, but it would be great to maybe change the name. The Street is a couple of other white supremacists. We got streets named after here, but just a suggestion.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'But sometimes you need to change. And she will look at me and I look at her and all I can do is raise an eyebrow like, well, where do I go to change the baby? So a lot of that practice I get at home, but I'm not able to exercise it in the public because there's no change'",
        "'speaker_10': 'stations that I can go to. So I think this initiative is great. I think I'm glad that this is moving forward. And also, I hope that this program also includes how to parent, you know, parenting skills. I mean, that's one of the most important things that we all have to encounter.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have three kids of my own, and one of them was really challenging with me and basically told me, how did you learn how to parent or where did you learn how to parent? Well, you know, I learned from my parents and my dad and my mom how to parent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there's not at my time anyway, there wasn't that opportunity to go to a class or or to get mentored in how to be a father and how to be a parent and how to be just a good human being.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that this program will go a long ways in doing that. And I hope that in future iterations of your program, that you would also include some some parenting classes and fathering classes, and not only to those that are already there, but perhaps for our future as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And especially with the the the growth and the the more that we have with young, young fathers and unmarried parents, I think that's very important that we reach out to them as well and provide them with that opportunity to grow, to learn to be good parents, because we need to break the cycle of bad parenting that we'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that we experience every year when we see that the great majority of our incarcerated people in prisons are the are the victims, if you will, of single parents. And because of the break ups that that happened when there were they were young or the abuse that they experienced when they were young, so that we could catch people'",
        "'speaker_10': 'early in terms of how to be good parents, good fathers, I think we would make a significant impact in the future. So thank you. That makes me a regular, including me on this.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'This is called a onesie, and you talked about an educational piece. So this has Snap's on the bottom for diaper changing. And on the on the business end, on the back, we put our motto go forth. Okay. So what I'd like to do is present this to Councilwoman Stacey Mongo Flanigan to her husband, actually, who can put'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you very much. That was okay. I don't know. I have daughters and they're a little older than that. Mr. Super Nice. So I think active fathers are not only healthy in the family setting, but they set an example for the future generation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, the item of baby changing stations, I think, is very it's a given now in this day and time because both men and women change babies. I really think that starting this is starting point and these changing and changing tables in our park facility is something that is very needed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, man, get ready. If you haven't done that, get ready for it. Stacey, I know we're going to get these things taken care of. So I want to thank you for. Councilwoman, you know, Vice Mayor, thank you for allowing me to be on inside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you could continue again because you were doing it. So I guess not. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to thank you guys for for recognizing all the fathers out there and making sure that us women don't have to listen to the excuses anymore, that there's not a changing table because we get that a lot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But really, I mean, having changing station seems like something that we should already have. I can't tell you how many floors and weird spaces and countertops that we've had to change babies at. So we really appreciate you guys, not only for the changing stations, but just recognizing the important role that fathers have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and my dad watches every Tuesday. I've only he's only been in my life for two years. So I just want to give him a shout out since he's watching right now and saying that having a father figure is really important no matter when they come into your life.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Q Councilwoman Drake.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I want to thank you for this item, too. And what do you know?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The third district also.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Has a onesie. It says Future Long Beach Leader has my logo on the back. So Councilwoman Mango, here you go. I think this is a great item. I will say I thank them. The men who signed on to the item might be the only men in the entire city who really want a changing room in the men's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'bathroom. Because it's very convenient that your wife's the only one who can change the diaper. But I think this is a really great item, and I agree with Councilwoman Pierce. I did not grow up with a father figure in my life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think it's important that we can do whatever we can to encourage it. And I think, you know, I love Councilman Super not talking about the snaps on the onesie because when we had our baby, I would dress them every day and take them to the Isabel Patterson Child Development Center, where he went to school, our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'oldest son. And the one day I was in a rush, I was in trial or something. I asked my husband to do it. I said, Can you just go put them in a onesie? And my son came out with a floaty pajama, which is not a onesie, with his tennis shoes crammed on over the foot, part of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the footie pajamas, walking out ready for daycare. And I had to explain to my husband that that was not a onesie, that was pajamas. So I think doing everything we can to encourage co-parenting and equal parenting is fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you. Councilman Gonzalez thinks, Vice Mayor Richardson, for bringing this forward again. And I'll just say, you know, I'm tired of the excuses as well from my partner not being able to change our child. But now we have the light is at the end of the tunnel, which is so great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Councilmember Mungo, I don't have a onesie. I do have a piece of chocolate for you, for your cravings. So I'd be happy to help help you on that end. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Is there any public comment on this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stephanie Cicero, second district. So last Tuesday or Monday, mass, get out the vote for the seventh District because I was up in Sacramento lobbying for some of the new cannabis laws up in Sacramento and brought my daughter, who I had a wonderful time meeting her representative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But unfortunately, in the middle, the meeting had to be changed. I would. At what point? At which point? I encountered the bathroom, men's bathroom at the office building in Sacramento, which lacks the changing table. Having this is incredibly important as a first step towards kind of towards the eventual goal of equal co-parenting in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, I really strongly urge, as of as a continuation of this particular item, to continue exploring universal pre-K within the city and the creation of such as a municipal right. That would go a long way towards creating gender equity within parenting and improving the lives of children in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'had to pay double duty as mom and dad. And so I want to acknowledge you and thank you for having to do that. But it is our role now and our responsibility as men and fathers to step up and not only change the diapers, but be actively involved in the lives of our children.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm here in support of this initiative. I believe that when men, fathers are involved in the lives of their children, in their family, that their children, our children can really thrive. And so I ask you and urge you to support this initiative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you for acknowledging fathers. There's a lot of work that needs to be done to change the perception of fathers. It's not that we don't want to be involved. It's not that we don't want to be included.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oftentimes, we're not given the opportunity. And so this will help to create a culture that will cultivate fatherhood friendliness. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'November of 2017. We're going to jump right into the presentation. Our cannabis program manager, AJ Cleary, is going to lead us through this presentation tonight. I want to first recognize, before I turn it over to AJ, that this has been a significant interdepartmental effort with multiple stakeholders, stakeholders engaged in the process and to arrive at the recommendations'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we're making tonight. And we have spent quite a bit of time working with the city attorney's office to come to the conclusion that we will make it tonight. And so with that said, I want to turn it over to AJ to lead us through the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And yeah, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor and members of the City Council. Council. I'm here to provide a presentation on the Adult Use Cannabis Ordinance prepared at the request of the City Council. The ordinance was drafted by the City Attorney's Office in close coordination with the city manager's office and other departments involved in regulating the cannabis industry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Before getting into adult use. I want to provide a quick update on the medical cannabis market in Long Beach. As of June 1st, the city has licensed 12 medical cannabis businesses. This includes nine dispensaries, one cultivator, one manufacturer and one testing laboratory.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In addition to the licensed facilities, there are 259 businesses in the process of obtaining a medical cannabis license. However, what we've learned from other states like Colorado and Washington is that the business startup failure rate in the cannabis industry is high, so it's difficult to predict how many of these pending businesses will actually open.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To help frame the discussion, I'd like to briefly run through the recent history of cannabis in California. Starting in 2015, the state legislature approved a series of bills to authorize commercial medical cannabis activity throughout the state. Soon after, in 2016, voters, California voters took it a step further by approving Proposition 64, which authorized statewide commercial adult use'",
        "'speaker_7': 'cannabis activity. Those bills were eventually merged into a single act known as the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, which remains in effect today under the MSU CRC, Medical and Adult Use. Cannabis businesses are only authorized to operate in cities that allow commercial cannabis activity within their jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Which brings us to Long Beach. In November 2016, Long Beach voters approved measure M-hm. A voter driven ballot initiative which authorized medical cannabis businesses to operate locally. Because Measure MM dealt only with medical cannabis. The city maintained an implicit ban on the adult use cannabis market.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Fast forward one year to November 2017. The Long Beach City Council directed staff to begin working on an ordinance to authorize commercial adult use cannabis locally. As part of that request. The City Council specifically directed staff to include a social equity program in the Adult Use Ordinance, which will be discussed later in this presentation in order to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'provide adequate time to prepare the draft ordinance. The City Council also approved a 180 day temporary ban on adult use cannabis businesses. The 180 day ban has ended. So today we are presenting a draft of the Adult Use Ordinance for City Council consideration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In preparing the proposed ordinance, staff staff drew from a wide range of resources. First city departments submitted policy recommendations to the city manager's office for consideration in the Adult Use Ordinance. These policy recommendations were based on recent experience with regulating the medical cannabis industry in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Next, the city attorney's office spent considerable time researching cannabis ordinances approved in other jurisdictions throughout California, as well as other states. Staff from the city manager's office also attended numerous neighborhood and industry meetings to hear the community's thoughts and concerns about cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And finally, staff fielded hundreds of direct calls and emails over the past year through the dedicated Long Beach cannabis hotline and email address. With that, I'd like to go through some of the key provisions that have been included in the Adult Use Ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'First, co-location co-location means permitting adult use and medical cannabis activity on the same premise. The Adult Use Ordinance will require co-location for dispensaries. In other words, only the existing medical dispensaries will be authorized to apply for an adult use dispensary license and only from their current location.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Unlike dispensaries, co-location will be optional for non dispensaries. Non dispensary businesses include cultivators, manufacturers, testing laboratories and distributors. These business types will have the ability to apply for a medical license, an adult use license or both licenses from the same facility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Businesses that apply for an adult use license will be subject to the requirements of the Adult Use Ordinance, identified as Chapter 5.92 of the Long Beach Municipal Code. Next, the ordinance sets restrictions on where adult use cannabis businesses can locate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It does this in two key ways. First, the ordinance establishes minimum buffer distances between adult use businesses and sensitive uses such as schools, beaches, parks, libraries and daycare centers. Specifically, buffer distances are a thousand feet from schools and beaches and 600 feet from parks, libraries and daycare centers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed buffer distances are the same for adult use as they are for medical cannabis facilities. Second, the Adult Use Ordinance Amends Title 21 of the Long Beach Municipal Code to add cannabis use types to the city's zoning tables.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In doing so, the city will ensure that moving forward, cannabis businesses locate around other appropriately zoned uses. For instance, industrial use types such as cultivators, manufacturers and distributors will be restricted to industrial zones of the city. Retail uses, including dispensaries, will be permitted in commercial or industrial zones of the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In other words, Title 21 will treat cannabis facilities like any other similar use type in the city. The purpose but with one exemption and that is that existing medical cannabis businesses will be authorized to apply for an adult use license from their existing location regardless of the new zoning requirements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The reason for the exemption is to recognize that many medical cannabis applicants have made significant investments in their properties based on previous location requirements. Without this exemption, a significant number of medical cannabis businesses will be forced to remain medical cannabis, only placing them at a significant disadvantage in the cannabis market.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Staff added a number of new public health provisions to the Adult Use Ordinance. First adult use businesses will be required to obtain a public health permit prior to operation. The permit will grant the city's health officer the authority to protect the health and safety of cannabis consumers and employees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Specifically, the health permit authorizes the health officer to conduct random quality assurance testing of cannabis goods and force packaging. Labeling and product storage requirements. Exclude employees diagnosed with an illness from handling cannabis goods, ensure basic sanitation of cannabis facilities and take other necessary precautions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The ordinance also authorizes the Long Beach Health Department to establish a responsible cannabis vendor program. The participation in the program will be mandatory for all new managers and employees of adult use dispensaries. Training topics will include cannabis, public health issues such as preventing youth access, risks of driving under the influence, proper methods for safe storage of cannabis'",
        "'speaker_7': 'goods and other important health related material. The ordinance also sets minimum security requirements for adult use cannabis facilities. Businesses will be required to maintain 24 hour onsite video surveillance, install security alarm systems and are monitored by a security company 24 hours a day.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hire security personnel, utilize electronic age verification devices to confirm proof of customer age and provide employee ID badges for use during business operation transportation or delivery of cannabis goods. Violations of the ordinance may be enforced by the city using various administrative, civil and criminal remedies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Specifically, this includes administrative holds on cannabis products, permit suspensions and revocations, administrative citations, civil penalties and criminal penalties. The multifaceted approach to enforcement will allow the city to tailor enforcement actions to the nature of each violation. In addition, the draft ordinance grants the city access to security camera recordings from businesses upon request.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Access to security footage will allow the city to fully investigate community complaints about cannabis businesses. Finally, the appeals process for penalties, suspensions or revocations of adult use cannabis permits will follow the standard procedures for other non cannabis businesses in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That means appeals will be heard by a hearing officer referred by the city clerk. The ordinance also grants the city full authority to charge fees to offset the cost of licensing and regulating adult use cannabis businesses. If the City Council moves to approve an adult use ordinance, staff will return to the City Council with proposed changes to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the master fee and charges schedule to establish new fees for the adult use cannabis industry. Proposed fees will include an annual regulatory fee, fire permit fee, health permit fee and tax audit fee, as well as one time fees for application review and criminal background investigations without establishing new fees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The General Fund will be forced to subsidize adult use cannabis regulatory activities. On this next slide, you'll see projected fy19 cannabis tax revenues for the medical cannabis market staff projects a potential increase of up to $750,000 in Fy19 general fund tax revenues from authorization of commercial adult use cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Bear in mind, though, that cannabis tax revenues are incredibly difficult to predict. For example, so far in FY 18, the city has collected significantly less in cannabis tax revenues than originally budgeted for this year. For this reason, we do not recommend budgeting any increase in business license tax revenues for the adult use market at this time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Staff will revisit cannabis revenue projections during the FY19 budget development process. That concludes the first part of my presentation. And now I'd like to go over the cannabis social equity program. As part of the request for an adult use ordinance, City Council directed staff to consider social equity policies to include in the proposed regulations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Based on this direction, the Office of Cannabis Oversight works with the Long Beach Equity Office and the Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network to develop recommendations on a cannabis equity program. The first step in this process was to research cannabis equity programs approved by other cities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we discovered through this research is that social equity has become a core focus of cannabis policymaking. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento and Oakland have all approved cannabis equity ordinances. State legislatures have also begun to develop cannabis social equity programs, including Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In December of 2017, Massachusetts passed the first statewide cannabis social equity program. Recently, the California State Senate began considering SB 1294 a bill to create a cannabis equity program for all of California across these states and local jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A consistent framework has begun to develop around cannabis equity policy. This framework involves defining who is eligible for the program, establishing program benefits, and designing a process to encourage partnership between businesses and low income residents. The goal of cannabis social equity is to recognize the impact that federal and state cannabis enforcement policies have had on low income'",
        "'speaker_7': 'communities across the country. Specifically, low income communities have experienced a greater number of arrests and convictions for low level offenses such as cannabis use and possession. Despite similar cannabis cannabis usage rates relative to other groups, a cannabis conviction can lead to permanent loss of property, disqualification from employment opportunities, reduced earnings, potential exclusion from public benefits such as'",
        "'speaker_7': 'housing assistance or student financial aid, and other negative consequences. Recognizing this fact. California voters or California residents voted to decriminalize cannabis activity at the state and local level. However, many cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland and Sacramento have taken this a step further by adopting cannabis social equity programs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These programs are meant to support economic inclusion in the cannabis industry for industry, for individuals who may have been negatively impacted by federal and state cannabis enforcement policies in the past. The first step is to define who should be eligible for the cannabis equity program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Other cities have consistently used income, geography and prior cannabis arrests as eligibility criteria. We are recommending the same for Long Beach. First, a person must be low to moderate income to qualify for the program. This is defined as having an annual family income at or below 80% of the area median income.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'By establishing income limits, the city will be able to target program eligibility to those individuals with the greatest need for assistance. Next, an individual must meet at least one of the following two criteria. Either was previously arrested or convicted for a low level cannabis related crime in Long Beach that could have been prosecuted as a misdemeanor or'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a citation under current California law, or lived in a low to moderate income census tracts in Long Beach for a minimum of three years. The arrest criteria is meant to identify individuals who are directly impacted by the enforcement of laws that have mostly been decriminalized at the state and local level.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The census tract criteria is meant to identify residents from disadvantaged neighborhoods whose communities have experienced the disproportionate burden of cannabis criminalization and enforcement. For individuals who qualify for the equity program, staff recommends providing two categories of benefits. The first category is direct business assistance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Business assistance for equity applicants includes fee waivers, expedited application review, expedited plan check, business license, tax deferrals and application workshops to help navigate the process. In addition, the Office of Equity will coordinate a fresh start clinics to help individuals previously convicted of a cannabis related offense, petition a judge to have their convictions reclassified, expunged or dismissed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Finally, we created an incubator program to help encourage partnership between established cannabis businesses and equity applicants. The incubator program requires businesses that do not qualify for the equity program to submit a plan to the city detailing how they intend to support equity applicants.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Incubator plans will be published and made available to equity applicants seeking additional support. The second cat. Excuse me. The second category involves employment opportunities. Staff has proposed a 25% equity employee hire requirement for all cannabis businesses to meet this requirement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A cannabis business must ensure that at least 25% of annual business work hours are performed by employees who are eligible for the cannabis equity program. A similar percentage requirement has been adopted by the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Businesses that fail to meet the 25 threshold may still satisfy the requirement if they show a good faith effort to hire equity employees. The equity hire requirement will be overseen by the Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network by advertising the program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Registering individuals interested in the program. Confirming employee eligibility. Connecting equity employees with businesses. And monitoring businesses for compliance with support from Pacific Gateway. We believe that the 25% requirement is an achievable standard for all cannabis businesses to meet and will expand, extend the benefits of the equity program to a much larger population within the Long Beach community'",
        "'speaker_7': '. In addition, the ordinance requires all adult use cannabis businesses to enter into a labor peace agreement with a labor union that represents cannabis workers in Long Beach. This requirement is consistent with the labor provision provision that voters approved for medical cannabis businesses through a measure aimed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Staff estimates a one time cost of 266,000 to develop the cannabis social equity program. The one time cost is anticipated to be offset by citywide budget savings in excess of established departments. General Fund Savings Targets in FY 18.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The one time cost includes 200,000 for Pacific Gateway to establish the 25% equity hire program, 50,000 for development services to offset the cost of providing automatic expedited plan checks for equity applicants and 16,000 for the equity office to coordinate the Fresh Start programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From ongoing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Costs related to the Pacific Gateway, 25% higher program will be offset through an equity hire fee charged to adult use cannabis businesses. Establishment of the fee will be requested through proposed changes to the master fee and charges schedule following passage of an adult use ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This slide outlines next steps for the overall adult use ordinance. The temporary moratorium on commercial adult use cannabis activities has expired. Regardless of this expiration, the city maintains an implicit ban on commercial adult use cannabis activity through its permissive zoning laws.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This implicit ban will only be lifted upon approval of a commercial adult use ordinance by the City Council. Absent this approval, staff will continue to deny applications for adult use cannabis business licenses in Long Beach. Should the City Council adopt the proposed ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Staff estimates that adult use cannabis sales from licensed Long Beach dispensaries could begin as early as August 2018. That concludes my presentation and I'm available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stay safe. Thank you. And so we'll go to public comment. At this point, any member of the public want to address the city council and I'll be the time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Very good. You. Kirk has the address. As I stated before, if the city is forced to have cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The only location that we will.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sell it on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a the top floor, the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Department, and we will rent out spaces there and the city will.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Make money for that. However, however.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That should only occur once the city gets stabilized. And what I mean stabilized when we have a city manager that is not a period principal individual and we have a new mayor who will shortly, I think, in the next 6 to 8 weeks, be indicted by the new US attorney who tomorrow morning and we'll be watching the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tapes. Where the mayor last week essentially thumbed his nose and gave his middle finger to the concept that he would be going to prison together.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'In the raising of marine stadium to s. Period. As I pointed out before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were other items that were a higher priority on the federal level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But once we get a new mayor, and I think that will happen probably within the next 11 months and we get.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As city manager, that is not Peter principle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We might be stabilized enough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To allow these. But then again, the only place we should allow them is on the top floor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the police department. We'll have one for each district. And they can be open.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe from 10 to 2 in the afternoon, in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To two in the afternoon, three days a week. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Mr. Vice Mayor and council horrible land. I was Googling this morning. Personally, I really didn't know. It says only one in seven California cities allow recreational marijuana stores. And also to find out that Orange County only has, I think, maybe three stores out of 34 cities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And those are typically in low income areas. I like to make some suggestions. One suggestion I wish I could make would. Why in the heck are we disregarding the laws and the rule of law? That flag? And why didn't we go with the throw with the 80% of the cities that hopefully won't sell this stuff?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just don't get it. But I guess I do. Well, and it's going to have to happen. The elephant in the room here is not shown in any of your research, any of your slides, that nothing that is that cannabis has been recognized by the military as having a negative impact on their perception.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And anybody in the military who drives a truck or a tank or an airplane and smokes pot, whether it's medical pot or any other kind of pot, is out because they know they hold this pot X on the brain, the highly THC part of it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now the CBD, CBD. And we have not touched upon the fact that in the training that their perception dysfunction quadruples when it's mixed with alcohol. So we're going to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The pot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'People coming from Orange County through our arteries, coming in through our schools, buying the pot. And we've got a lovely place for them to come down after they smoked a few joints and have a beer, whether it's a shoreline or a sauna for sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then they go back their merry way to Orange County. So I think Orange County. So this is a quality of life issue. And I in fact, before I even knew that Orange County had so few, I asked myself the question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I said, who in Laguna Beach or in Newport Beach wants to have pot sales? Well, and you know who it is. Nobody anyway. Also all half the money needs to go to these kids. That that to the development we need of course, at City College or of course, it or we should avoid school district in 12th grade'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and take half the money dedicated to use activities and teaching all that. But it may be okay, but you mix well with alcohol and you're going to be possibly a dead player. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up is vice mayor. I'm sorry. We're going to go back to public comment to let me click on public comment. Yes. We have five members of the public. Is there anyone else as to public comment before I close the speakers list?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have you included Francis. Okay, then the five folks that are here. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stephanie orson. So, second district. Congratulations, stacy on your child. Parenthood is awesome. It's gonna be great. Also, in response to Mr. Goodyear's suggestion that we sell weed at the beginning, at the top of the police department, our police station chief Luna is a fine police officer, but I sincerely doubt his ability to tell me what a really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'good gram is right now. The only adult use commercial retailers are unlicensed, untaxed and are selling untested product. I posted a picture on my Facebook account from there featuring some of the product that's actually sold by somebody who delivers services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's dried. Brown doesn't contain any of the helpful Terrapins that you would actually want. Really is not fit for any sort of human consumption. But it's being sold daily here with the lack of adult use licenses being offered last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adult medical businesses have served as an excellent model for future regulation. These retailers of PET that are open today have incurred zero violations for illegal underage sales. By comparison, the 7-Eleven near my house and on Orange Avenue has had its license suspended at least once a month, every month this year so far.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, we we it's a brand new day today here in 2018, unlike in 2014, when I was the only stoner on the 14th floor quietly begging for my weed stores to stay open. We have state level regulatory. We have a state level regulatory framework.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have retail taxes, and we have the ability to use affirmative zoning laws and clear to support the clear electoral support that has been provided on this particular issue. I want to thank specifically the council and the city attorney's office for their time and concern in this man on this matter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please pass it as is. In addition, I want to add a particular plank for the social equity thing to be concerned about. Right now, the district attorney's office in Los Angeles, as well as our city prosecutor's office, has the data available regarding the ratio of any particular racial disparity regarding marijuana arrests or any of the the status'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of our of people who have felonies that are felonies on their record, marijuana felonies on the record that would be eligible for expungement. In terms of data sharing, if those were provided to to advocates within this area and or frankly, just automated, I mean, I think that they're probably given the number of people are calling my office'",
        "'speaker_2': ', they're probably a fair number of people in the city that would benefit from that. So automatic expungements for felony marijuana, felons, that's been something that's been considered on the state level and as well as been adopted by a couple of different cities throughout the state.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's really worth considering. Thank you and have a good day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Counsel, for this opportunity to speak with you. I've worked with a few of you over the past year. I have spoke publicly one other time and it was after a roundabout discussion that got bloody. So I'm happy that all the previous presenters had happy things to talk about and the social equity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm Greg Emmett. I'm part of the Go Forward group that won a license at 5630 Pacific Coast Highway. It's in the Iron Triangle and Susie Price's district. Although we've heard stories about the city being hard to work with, I got to tell you a personal experience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been great. Planning and zoning has been great and the council has been great. Very open minded. I've I come from Colorado. I moved here over a year ago. I have one licenses and 22 states. I've got a lot of a lot of history helping cities and police departments write rules and regulations, training the marijuana enforcement division'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in Colorado in my facility, teach them things to look for, things not to look for. I look forward to working with Commander Herzog in our district and having an open door policy. I think transparency is very important, especially in the marijuana industry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even with people that live near or near a place, an open door policy to come in and see how it's done. Now, in Denver, Colorado, we've seen teen use drop by 11%. We've seen opiate addiction go down. Opiate deaths go down.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've seen veterans. I know we've been talking about military. We've seen veterans get helped tremendously overcoming post-traumatic stress disorder. I've seen children go from 300 seizures a month to three a year. So I'm a big proponent for marijuana, medical and adult use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adult use. We've seen in Denver is out-of-state people coming from states that they cannot get help. Midwest states, it's illegal. They travel and spend money in our community, pay taxes. I think if you really look look at your vote tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you vote now, it's a vote yes for all the illegal people out there. Right now, there are 64 illegal delivery companies in the city right now. I don't think necessarily if you vote yes that it means that you're you're going to be visiting the store and buying marijuana next week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what it does show is that you're listening to your voters and that you are ready to get the get the dark side of marijuana out of the back alleys, get the pesticides out of the out of the product, and really provide a clean medicine for people to help their ailments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next week, a piece.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Lewis. I'm from the fifth District. Thank you for letting me speak. I live over by Ward, the Norwalk boulevards. There is a marijuana dispensary that's been permitted to go in there. It's close to two schools and also in a residential area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I really don't agree with the blanket proposal you have in front of you today that says all marijuana medical dispensaries should be open to adult use. In fact, I would actually think we should look at expanding the distance of these dispensaries from school.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is really I don't know what due diligence this council has done to look into the adult use in other cities, for example, Seattle and Portland. I know some people on the police department up there that actually have stated there's been an increase in violent crime, theft, burglary and traffic accidents, as the gentleman said earlier, from the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'result of legalization of marijuana. So unless the city is really committed to hiring additional police to patrol our schools, our communities. I am very concerned about our children's well-being. There's a lot of children that walk home every day around these dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if you make it adult use, you know there's potential for additional threats. We have enough threats of violence around our schools these days. We don't need this additional potential threat imposed by this initiative. As a representative of the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can potentially be held personally liable, responsible for harm to these children by these decisions you make today. I know I will personally, you know, look to your decision and go back to the different cities and excuse me, the different schools and take your decisions back to those who are in the schools, in school administration, and let'",
        "'speaker_4': 'them know what your decision is. I ask that you expand the distance of these dispensaries from our schools and our homes and to not convert all of these to. Dispensaries. Two adult use. I mean, we have plenty of dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't need any more, especially adult use. I ask that you please do the right thing for community, have a moral compass, and look out for our children's well-being. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Nick Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is and I can say I'm a resident in the sixth district. I love this country because, you know, you can have people who advocate individualism and a right to privacy and limited government in one breath. And then in the next breath, they ask for a government, you know, imposed energy, but towards what you do in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'your household. It's very interesting. I think that this I'm in support of this bill to be passed. I think the time that we're at it is a surprise. What was that like? Was that a dog whistle coming from you?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm in support of this because I love the city and I love the idea of tax revenue coming into the city, especially in regards to, you know, we recently had in the last election was a measure him or her in order to offset the the tax money that we needed for the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I feel like this is what the city needs. It's a it's a beautiful example of, you know, trying to work within the capitalist system that we have here. This is a this I think a lot of city governments have been looking at marijuana as a as something other than a commodity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a commodity. These bands increase the activity and the presence in the market of illicit drug cartels. And the longer you take to pass these things, the more market share, you know, drug cartels and other illegal groups maintain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's great that we have people from Colorado and other states that have also recognized this as a legal right coming into the city. I like the idea of the Pacific Gateway. I think it should be increased.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it should be more than 25%. We should incentivize these companies coming in to hire more people. And also potentially, I'm not sure the legality of what the banks situation here with carrying money come from marijuana companies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if we can incentivize them or force them to hold more of their money in banks here in the city, that would also be a great way for us to bring more revenue in. And thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hey, good evening. Good evening, Mayor. Good evening, council. I definitely support the passing of the. I'm sorry. Oh, I support the passing of the recreational marijuana. However, I want us to really understand that the disparity disparities in cannabis arrests have caused hardship to the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Last data that I read from 2013 that was studied over ten years showed that the African-American community is 13% of Long Beach, however, made up 46% of the arrests. The Long Beach was third only to San Diego in Los Angeles, in the state of California for cannabis arrests higher than San Jose, which is double the population.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My concerns are we have a base for social equity, but we don't have a strong social equity piece that I think. And Mayor, you were quoted actually in an article in 2013 when those stats came out and you were very concerned, which I really appreciated about those stats because of those arrests and those disparities when you were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'vice mayor. So what I encourage us to do is we've personally sat with the Cannabis Association. I think they're an incredible association that's willing to work with businesses and community members to create a path to social equity. However, as of right now, we have a very skeletal basis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have no reinvestment fund and no tax dollars going back in when states are going up to 50% investment back into youth development. I believe some of the tax dollars are used.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ways, but they're not directly to social programs or services. The path to ownership is also an obstacle because there's no set amount. There is no. For example, San Francisco gives 50% of all of its permits to social equity applicants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My recommendation is that we have a social equity fee and that that fee is supports nonprofit foundations in those districts where that particular cannabis industry is and that we define more so the path to ownership as well as integrate more education into the social equity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Small businesses have a hard time opening up as it is without all of the rules and regulations. And so just sort of giving them a way in without the tools and the assistance and financing and training is an obstacle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just I just ask that if we I don't want to stop from the passing, but I really ask that we explore the social equity piece because I think this is a moment for us to to undo a lot of the wrongs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think it could build the city as a whole. So thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Mayor Councilmembers My name is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Matt Bellamy, Executive Vice President of Europe, CW Local 324 That represents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A little over 100 cannabis workers here in the city of Long Beach. I just want to stress the sense of urgency of passing this tonight. As most folks know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People are like leaving the city. I think 70% of the people that go into the dispensaries today think it's recreational and therefore leave. And so without passing this tonight, it really is a death sentence for these businesses and for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good union jobs in the city. When we've passed contracts and workers have voted to accept contracts, some of these young folks in these shops have actually turned to us and said, you know, I'm so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excited I can go home and I have the same benefits. I have a great living wage. I can tell my parents, I can move out, I can have insurance, I have a pension. I have all the things that a good job requires.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it would be extremely unfortunate if.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't get this passed tonight and really let down those workers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, the potential to have great union jobs in the city with the expansion is what we're really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Looking to do. And I'm sure every council member here would like those good union jobs in their city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So again, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would ask that you move.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Forward and pass.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But evening, honorable mayors, city council, city attorney, city staff. My name is Adam Hijazi. I'm on the board of directors of the Long Beach Collective Association. I just wanted to share some quick notes regarding cannabis regulation. So as we all know, it's been a very complex and we've been grappling with this for about nine years at this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'point right now. You know, we've dealt with zoning. What distances? Community reinvestment efforts, job training, public education. We're also working on creating jobs and good paying jobs for that. And through our engaging with the community and hearing other leaders concerns and the municipalities concerned as well, we feel like measure and member and with the voters has been'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a compass to cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With that being said, we understand. And some of the difficulties that came from it. But nonetheless, the measure was enacted by the voters now. City staff has worked for the last six months regarding putting an ordinance forward to move cannabis in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And quite frankly, the legal markets are hurting. It's not what everybody thinks it is. We're hurting every single day. And we just want to be able to compete against whatever illicit market is out there. There are there are concerns because this is such a complex issue, whether it's social injustices that's happening that I think needs to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'addressed, whether it's how we're going to enforce against some of these deliveries and other issues that we have here in the city. But the most important thing is that we need to undo this not which is not being adult use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a lot of cities around us have already moved in that direction. But more importantly, they shouldn't be the ones moving. We're the city of Long Beach, and I think we're the model and we can show what a good, solid cannabis ordinance can look like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So really what we ask is the ability to be able to compete. There's a lot of enforcement mechanisms that are going to be able to help. But I think with the legal markets being in the front, it will slowly defund some of these illicit market and these issues that are in our city today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we talked about hours of operation potentially. That's state law saying 10:00 and it is what it is. Do you want to do nine? You want to do ten, whatever it is. But the bottom line is people are not going to stop buying cannabis at 8:00.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're either going to go to the guy down the street or they're gonna go to Wilmington or they're going to go to wherever it is that they need to go to be able to get there. So again, it's really about giving us the ability to compete with what is and it's not only about the hours of operation'",
        "'speaker_2': ', it's really the city's support, which we have had good conversations with among our city staff and different individuals, individuals in the city that are that are getting it. We just ask city council to support us and to please support this ordinance tonight and move it forward, because there is an urgency going on here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And our last speaker assembly, Dustin Harris.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have put together. I'm Francis, Emily Dawson, Paris, my reside in District one, and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I put together a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Presentation for you and I have a three page document, communications for the police officer, the tenant cabin copy of which is the city attorney, Mike Mace has the entire copy of it and I'll give you an excerpt. And it speaks about the major problem is smoking marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The bus stops on the metro platform and inside the metro line. And so when I looked at this article regarding the governor's spell and it spoke about the marijuana, the cities have a decision of yes or no, whether or not they want to have recreational marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's up to the city because I see that this is on the agenda. So the same mom is just looking at this as a potential moving forward on it. I am a pediatric nurse. There's copies of all these articles on the research I've done which I've given to the city clerk for the hard copies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, I've heard a lot this evening, and what a predicament you're in. We might not be sitting here today with this matter in such a fashion if when it went on the ballot there was about to have for the stay long missed vote regarding having recreational marijuana are and having.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Medicinal dispensaries maybe had two different ballot measures. And then the voice of the people would have been main down and the one going and trying to figure out yay or nay what we're going to do about recreational marijuana and looking at the dangers of mixing marijuana, whether it's medicinal, recreational, with drugs, with alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's catastrophic. There's such a thing called acute marijuana intoxication. Also, it escalates problems for persons with neurodevelopmental disorders and other types of conditions. You really have a major decision you have to make this evening. I actually think that the city is not prepared to move forward on this massive amount of what you have before us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm looking at the children and the effect of it getting in their hands. I don't think what we have in place would need to have to have in place to have the city protect it. I actually think that this matter should be put on hold and we need to come back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The chief of police is here. You know, I've spoken about what the police have to say about it, so I don't have that much time to speak. But I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak. But I actually think that there's some major matters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Each one of you have opportunity to come forward to get this matter and a better fashion than what it is right now, because it's really not working out. And I think every one of you can figure out a way that we can get together and get this work out, because it can't be about the money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's got to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About the welfare.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the city, the welfare of the children, the welfare of the people that live here. And there are cities that have banned having medicinal marijuana. And I have them listed down on here. And I have probably Beverly Hills, Glendale, Inglewood, Pasadena, West Covina and do not permit recreational marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm going to leave it to you to do the right thing. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do the right thing. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Appreciate it. Okay, great. Thank you so much. So we are now going to close public comment and we're going to go to some discussion from the city council. So I'm going to have a few points I'm going to say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then I might turn this over to Vice Mayor Richardson. He's got a first motion and then we'll go we'll go from there. I do want to start by saying that I think that it's important to note that there's a lot of a lot of the council has been obviously dealing with this issue for a long time'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And I just want to be tonight and I ask also that those here that are the audience in the audience to also have a little patience there is going to be, I think, a conversation. And I think we want to make sure that we get to a place where we have something that there is approval on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to make sure that it's going to be ideas and I know they're going to be presented. And so I just want to make sure that people know that. I mean, everyone is trying to come at this from a place of a kind of caring about the community and caring for their issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know in the past these some of these debates have not gone well, but I just ask that I ask those watching to watch what's going to happen. I think you're going to have a good conversation on an important topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The second thing I want to make my position very clear, and I hope it also guides where the council goes. I think the voters have spoken on this issue multiple times. I think they, in large majorities at the California state level, passed recreational marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In large majorities, they passed a local ordinance to support marijuana here in the city. That created the ordinance that we have and certainly at almost 70% pass the taxing mechanism that we have created here in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know this mechanism well because I worked with the UFC, you and a lot of the business owners to create what was, I believe, a fair tax system for our dispensaries in Long Beach. And so. I think my like a lot of folks, views have also changed over time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I do believe that it's been pretty clear that voters in California support, support not just medicinal marijuana, but also recreational marijuana. And so I'd support staff recommendation. I've made that already. I think public and clear. I think they have a proposal in front of us that is fair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It affirms the will of the voters. And in my opinion, it moves us to where the conversation on this is across the country. And I think if you look at most major cities, this is the conversation that that they're having.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, I'm also aware that there's also concerns and and some questions from other council members. And I think those are fair. I think they should be discussed so we can come up with something that folks can can come to some consensus on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I just wanted to make sure that I was clear about where I'm at. But I also respect where other folks are coming from on this issue because it's complex as well. And so with that, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I wanted to just start by just saying this has been a really long conversation. I remember when I was still Neil's chief of staff and, you know, they went through a whole process and lotteries and all those things and it's developed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That conversation has certainly developed. I've learned, I've grown. I've seen the the voters in the state of California, the voters in Long Beach reiterate their position on this time and time again. I've learned a few things. So one thing I've learned is past experience is the best indicator of future performance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And every time the council has has gotten this, we haven't gotten it right. But we've tried to create a more perfect system and I think we've gotten better. The mayor mentioned Measure in May. That was, you know, the community come forward with Measure M to legalize medical marijuana and the city saw an opportunity to sort of, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, of course. Correct. Put forward a balanced measure on taxes and put it forward to the voters. And the voters rewarded this and we got it right that time. I think we have an opportunity to get it right again today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So first, I want to thank our city staff for the presentation. I think it included a lot of the things that the council gave direction on. And that's important because we you know, I you know, the second thing I've learned is really we have a true diversity of opinion in our city and all of them are are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'valid. And we go through this process to try to create something that really works and is custom fit for Long Beach. And so six months ago, we asked staff to take a six month pause and, you know, pause everything while we go back and really dig into the recreational ordinance, evaluate how it's going to work in relation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to the medical marijuana ordinance, consider opportunities to craft, you know, some, you know, take a look at what we're doing around social equity. And we had a presentation from National League of Cities and we took a look at what city other cities are doing to make sure that that's sort of central, central theme in this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And since then, the city manager's office, the Office of Equity, City Attorney's Office, I just want to say, I think they've done a fantastic job at bringing a well-thought out ordinance to city council. So I want to just say thank you to the entire team that worked on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I really respect the work that you did on this. And just to be crystal clear, I support staff's recommendation. And so so I think that there are some elements I want to focus for a minute on the social equity piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the city has made a constant conversation and began to grapple with this conversation around equity and and economic inclusion. And I think that the economic inclusion elements here are consistent with our blueprint for economic development, consistent with our EVERYONE initiative, and is consistent with the values of what the things that the Council has supported and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has begun to support even more in recent years. So I want to highlight that. So a few things, a1a few things I want to call out. So one, it provides opportunities for local Long Beach residents to begin to own their own businesses in a new emerging industry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that shouldn't be. I think that should not be understated. I think secondly, it provides support for local entrepreneurs as they begin this this this journey, this process that could be confusing for many people, this process of a brand new emerging industry to provide support it it installed it creates a process fresh start clinics to ensure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we're providing opportunities and second chances for by peop for people impacted by drug enforcement policies prior to the legalization of cannabis. So I really want to call out the Fresh Start clinics. I think it's a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This ordinance has opportunities for quality family supporting union jobs for local residents. I think that is something that can't be understated as businesses open. There is there's a requirement here for quality union jobs that support families. So this is a this is a great start.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as I mentioned, you know, past experience is the best indicator of future performance. This is a council driven ordinance. So we can always come back, make additions, tweak it, evaluate it and make changes. We can always do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so so I applaud I applaud the work that's been done. So I'm going to make make a make a motion here. But I want to just clarify two points that I'm going to I'm going to mention. So, one, there was significant interest on behalf on the part of the people in the community and on the local'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hire goal at 25%. Now we have a project labor agreement with a goal of 40%. I think that we should set we should aim high to hit our mark. I think we should aim for a 40% goal. So I'm going to make a recommendation to move forward with staff's recommendation, but make an adjustment for 25% to 40%'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And secondly, I want to clarify some language I know that we've talked about. There's there is something in here for workers. There's something in here for small business owners. But what about just the surrounding community? Let's say that you are not a user of cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You are not interested in work. In a cannabis business. You are not interested in owning a cannabis business, but this new businesses in your district. How do you make sure in your area how to make sure that we track and evaluate the rent, the community reinvestment that's happening with these businesses?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many of these businesses that are already opened are already doing a good job at reinvesting into our communities where they're located. But I think that we should we think we can track it and then continue to encourage it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's why I'm proposing that there's a report that is submitted, and I think we should call this our community. There's a report that each cannabis businesses support is submitting as a part of this ordinance, and I think we should call that a community reinvestment report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it really outlines and demonstrates your commitment to reinvestment the activities that you do. It keeps a lens of equity. It's important to local communities. And I think that's something important that the community knows that there is a plan for community reinvestment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's something that came out of community. So I know there was a lot of conversation about the use of cannabis taxes. I just want to be clear. There is this isn't the conversation to talk about cannabis taxes or equity fees or any of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's all budget conversations as master fee and charges, schedule conversations. That's really not a part of this conversation. So I'm going to go ahead and start with a main motion, and this is the staff motion with those small sort of clarifications.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I move that we receive the supporting documentation to the record, conclude the public hearing, adopt, accept the negative declaration, and that we declare the ordinance amending the lobbyist municipal code by adding Chapter 5.9 to and amending Title 21 of the city's zoning regulations related to the regulation of adult use cannabis activity together with a local coastal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'program amendment read for the first time in LED and laid over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading with the following changes to the text of Chapter 5.9 to as presented staff's recommended action.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So number one, that Section 5.92.154.8.1 be amended to change the social equity local hire goal from a minimum of 25% to a minimum of 40%, to be consistent with the city's project labor agreement goals. And that the second that the first sentence of section 5.92.1540. B be amended.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Minutes Read. Adult Use Cannabis Businesses shall submit a community investment, community reinvestment and small business incubation plan to the city, describing how they intend to support equity businesses, adjacent neighborhoods and communities within eligible social equity program census tracts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also move that we further adopt the resolution directing the Director of Development Services to submit a request to the California Coastal Commission to certify an amendment to the city's certified local coastal program. So that is my motion, to be clear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That motion allows us to move forward with a first reading today, and city attorney has a copy of this motion and essentially is the same ordinance that's presented with an amendment to a local hire and clarification of language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I encourage City Council to stay the course. I'm open. You know, I would love to continue the conversation. I know there's a there's a diversity of opinions and let's see where we land. But I hope that we can try to incorporate the interests and the needs of what people want and that we maintain the structure, integrity of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the witnesses, present it today, and that we move forward today. Those are the things that I think should be a guideline or guardrails for the conversation today. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mary. And I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for being so thoroughly in his motion, because I totally support staff's recommendation and I totally accept the amendments, not amendments, but the enhancements that you've recommended as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's in line with what what the people have voted for. I mean, we've been through this now for at least the four years that I've been here. And I know that this started back in 2008, 2006, around there when a different council was addressing this issue when it first came to light.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, I mean, we've been at this now going on ten years and we're almost at the end of the trail tonight. And I think that that's one of the opportunities that we have that that we can basically put it to play tonight so that the already the businesses that already have been licensed can continue to keep their'",
        "'speaker_10': 'doors open, continue business. It's true that this document is a living document. We can always come back and tweak it if we need to in regards to any necessary changes that we may need to make to comply with with current law.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But we can't do that unless we get something in action on the table tonight. I'm totally supportive of Vice Mayor Richardson's motion, and I hope that my colleagues I know we're going to have a robust discussion coming up, but I hope that in the end that my colleagues will be supportive of passing the solution.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I have some questions about local hire for Mr. Schultz. So there were in the presentation I received from the staff last week, there were criteria by which a local hire counted. And there was some discussion in the community that they felt that some of those requirements were because of our funding, which I know could not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'possibly be true, because you can't use real funding when you're discussing an item that's illegal at the federal level. So my question for you is, if the ordinance stated well, I guess we can talk about what it states today, you could hire up to 40% either low income or from a CDBG.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would you be comfortable supporting and lifting through that program? Because in the presentation I received, it was you had to be low income and from either a CDBG or a low level offender, which I think is with a 40% goal, a significantly more difficult measure to meet and a significantly more difficult monitor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And from what I understand, you are the monitor and your staff, even though funded through general fund, would have to be the one verifying all these components if A, then B and all these others. And I just don't see as an employer having to actually own the business before being able to use that kind of consideration in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hiring.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Mongo before Mr. Schulz answers that, we'd like to take an opportunity to have Mr. Kelaher, Mr. Cleary, clarify the criteria that we're proposing relating to the question that you're asking. Wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. So we view and recommended the policy because it does have a local hire component to it. The 25% or potentially 40% equity hire requirement is open to individuals who have lived previously in low or moderate income areas of the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They don't currently have to live there. So it is open up to two other residents of Long Beach Community. And the second pathway that we created for applicants is for low income individuals with a prior cannabis arrest or low level cannabis conviction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And those residents could have lived anywhere in the city as well. So there is open opportunity in the city. But we also chose to target low and moderate income areas of the city, specifically for the higher requirement because of the nexus that it has to two prior cannabis arrests and the focus on low income areas in the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'city generally. So that's why we we chose to target low and moderate income census tracts through the program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my desire would be low and moderate income census tracts or currently low income. Is that something you might be amenable to, vice mayor?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My understanding is that we already have some flexibility. Let's have city staff try to clarify. I think there is a trigger if you're not of those first strikes and you meet other criteria. So let's just get a better understanding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. AJ, would you mind clarifying that a little bit?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. So two responses, I guess. First, the, the, the first answer that I gave, which was that there is still a pathway for residents of the city that are not currently residents of lower mud census tracts. But also, I would want to discuss what some other cities have done to encourage local hire in addition to the equity'",
        "'speaker_7': 'hire requirement. So for example, the city of Los Angeles has a 30% equity hire requirement, but in addition, they have a 50% local hire requirement for cannabis businesses. That's not necessarily an equity component because it's not so much an equity policy as it is just a local hire policy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the two can work in coordination with one another. Same thing with San Francisco. San Francisco has a 50% equity hire requirement. But as part of that, they also have a 30% local hire requirement. So it's possible to to still separate the two issues because as staff, we view them as as two separate issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's equity for low and moderate income individuals from particular geographies of the city. But then there's also local hire, which is not really part of the equity program. But if it's a priority of city council, they could include that as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Separate, though, from the equity policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate your answer, but it's not what I'm asking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Can I can I take a crack at it, please? Thank you. So currently, as the proposal was written, you in order to qualify, you have to be low income and. And from one of the longmont's census tracts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Or low income. And have anywhere in the city or a previous resident of the city. And have a prior cannabis arrest record. That or incident that could have been that would have been charged as a misdemeanor prior to 2016.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So so that is what I interpreted the briefing to have stated. But that is not what I've interpreted some of the dialog in the community and with my colleagues to be. So what I would like it to be is anyone who lives in Long Beach and is low income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you lived in an area or don't live in an area, but you live at home with your parents who happen to live in an area that's no longer low income, then you're low income. We should be hiring you and we should be giving those great jobs to those individuals no matter where you live in the city'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Another thing is we are looking to bring up the median income of the CDBG areas. So if you live in any of these areas, if you live in the first, the second, the sixth parts of the ninth and then the seventh.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Any of those residents would, by being hired in a good job that pays a good wage with a 50 cent raise every six months, we would be able to increase the median income in those communities. And one of the things that Mayor Garcia raves about is how in some of the lowest income areas of our city, we've'",
        "'speaker_4': 'seen a $20,000 annual median income increase, and that's because we're putting people to work. And so I would like to state if Mr. Richardson's open to the friendly, you can be living anywhere in the city of Long Beach as a low income person, or you can live in a low income area as designated by the map that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've seen. That was during the briefing. And both of those would count towards the requirement to hit 40%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So a couple of things. One, I talked about the guardrail we want to keep today is making sure we don't you know, we maintain the integrity of the ordinance, so we keep the first reading. So my first question for city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A change like that, is that a simple change or is that something requires going back to the first reading?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor Richardson I think it depends. I'm trying to think of an easy way to do this, that we could do it simply by injury, linear. And I don't I could offer a suggestion. I'm not sure if it meets Councilwoman Mango's goal, but what we're talking about, if you have your ordinance in front of you, is on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'page 121 of the ordinance, and it is section 5.9, 2.152083. And that Section A3 A says the individual satisfies at least one of the following criteria. Small AA has lived in a Long Beach census tract for a minimum of three years, where at least 51% of the current residents have a household income at or below 80% of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the Los Angeles County median income. We could make an easy change that I think we could accomplish tonight by striking the three year requirement. That would mean that we would take out the three year residency requirement and would read a person would qualify if they lived in along long census tract for a minimum excuse me, living along'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the census tract where at least 51% of the current residents have a household income at or below 80% of the Los Angeles County area median income. So that would be no matter where in the city and there would be no requirement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So someone could qualify tomorrow. That is something that we could do easily by intermediation, if that if that meets your goal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what if someone is a low income resident but doesn't live in a census tract? And let me let me take a step back and address, Mr. Vice Mayor. RICHARDSON Yeah. One of the other things I'm asking for would actually make the first start date of operation September 1st.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The difference between a first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reading out of respect. If you can finish that, if you can finish the thought on the first, once we get clarity, city attorney wants to be very clear about every change and I certainly want to hear you, but I really want to close the loop so we get it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I just wanted to. I just want to. Every idea is good and important, and I recognize there's a really big rush. My goal would be everyone has to pass it tonight. I've heard that at least 40 times in a week, at least from 40 different people, sometimes from the same person.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I do appreciate those of you who have met with me on this matter, because I know that we've had very good discussions. But my goal would be that we have adult use available in the city September 1st.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The difference to me of August 10th and September 1st to get it right and to make sure that you guys aren't getting restrictions that are going to be so hamstrung that you actually are going to not want to or not be able to meet them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would be worse off. And this from a person who feels so passionately about it and have met with the community so many times. And I have residents here who know I've had over 20 community meetings, many of which the dispensaries in my district have attended.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My district knows I am willing to vote yes to get this passed for you to have adult use by September 1st. If the requirements are in place that protect the neighborhoods and make it possible that Long Beach residents get all these jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I'm trying to make it easier to hire Long Beach residents no matter where they live, if they're currently low income or can demonstrate they've been low income. Because I have Section eight renters in 90808 today, people who are on Section eight in 90808 today that need jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so would I like you to hire someone from downtown to drive across the city to one of the six dispensaries in my district? No. Hire one of the nine a way to eight people. Who's on the section eight role?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alison has a list she can work with. Nick will give everyone a list of potentials. But under the current way that it's written, it's so restrictive. I can't just hand you guys a list of here's 70 residents that are all eligible that help you meet your 40%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I appreciate that. And if we can just change the end to an order, I think that would hopefully be agreeable. I see you guys have finished conversing. Do you have an answer now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm Mr. Mais cricket. I'm wrong. But I think that the initial request that Councilman Mangal made, which was on the local hire piece, that is possible. And we'll still keep this a first reading, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If if we make if we remove the three three year requirement. But I don't think that meets what she is asking for. And I think what Councilwoman Mango is asking for, unless you could give me, you know, line and verse of what it is exactly we want to amend.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We couldn't do that on the floor tonight. We could bring it back after we have a chance to rewrite it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Mango, if I can just interject here. So, number one, two things. So I don't disagree that if someone in Long Beach gets a job at a dispensary, that it's it's it's something that we should discourage. I don't disagree.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. However, two things. The guardrail we're talking about is sort of maintaining the integrity of the ordinance. There's the whole intention of calling out specific zip codes was to say 100%, you're going to hire 100% of people. You still have 60% of your workforce are still going to hire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That could all be from Long Beach. It says that you want to try to target either people who live in zip codes, who are, you know, zip codes, who traditionally face certain issues. The census, like these maps, were not created by city staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're consistent with federal CDBG maps. That's that's that's the intention there. I think we maintain the integrity there and there's and the order that you're looking for. So if someone has a record, they no matter where they live there, there it is included.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other parties we talked about. We're going to continually have to change this if we find that 40% or 25% is not feasible or that we have people that people you know, we have people that are looking to be like, I doubt someone's going to say, I'm not hiring you because you don't live in this census tract'",
        "'speaker_2': '. It's not realistic that it's going to take at least six months for Pacific Gateway to work through this whole process. If city staff comes back in Pacific, we come back and says, there's a real problem. We're not high enough for fifth District residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then we'll make it. You know, we can make that change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me just finish my thought. Let me just finish it. So what I would say is, if that's not something we can do tonight, I respectfully would ask, is that something that earns your support or is this something that you're at?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is it something that earned your support tonight?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it depends. I have a few other items and I think that's the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Answer without a full understanding of the full picture what you're asking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'd also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Say I just have a list that I'm keeping. That's what I'll just do for now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would also say that the local hire passed by this council years ago, which has an annual report, has never met its goals and doesn't come back. And so it's easy to say that, but we're fighting 70 to 100 items a week right now, items where they're important and great and they take hours of our time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and we it doesn't come back. So maybe. Let me ask Mr. Mayes another option. Mr. Mayes, if we pass the ordinance tonight, as it is, could we go to second reading on July 10th and bring an amendment on July 10th that would then be amended?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just the amendment things tonight to that ordinance on July ten, before a first reading of an ordinance amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, if it was the type of amendment that was small in nature, for instance, if you are changing an hour of operation from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., we could do it because that's an easy thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if we're making major changes to the structure of the ordinance and the public hasn't been notified of that, I would say we couldn't do it, but we would treat it as a first reading on July 10th and bring it back at the next council meeting the following week for a sec for first second reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So maybe what we should be doing is working on an amendment that comes back on a different date so that all of those amendments could still be folded in before the August 10th versus September 1st open date. Because I feel like I'm going to get pushback on any item that I've discussed with anyone who has an opinion'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on this. If you are legally allowed to speak with so far because it has to make it the mark of it has to be the first reading tonight, which I just don't feel is reasonable. And it doesn't give an opportunity for a true dialog at the Council, which is what I expect of my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm going to reserve the rest of my amendments here. What my colleagues have to say. I'm a Q up at the end.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I did want to Mr. Mayes raised a good point that I don't think we covered in the motion that Vice Mayor Richardson made, and that's hours of operation. Is your proposal to change the current hours of operation?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if so, what's that proposal?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I so that was a piece that was presented here. And I'm happy to I'm happy to read it and get your feedback since you're cued up. So this specific bullet is and I'll read it, it is that section 5.92.915 be amended to permit dispensaries that operate to operate until 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m., and that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all deliveries must be completed before 10 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. up to seven days per week. Now my understanding from a city attorney an adjustment from 8:00 to 10:00 is not something that would trigger another first reading.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's totally on the table for us to discuss.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so that's one of the things I want to talk about. So I just have a few comments and I appreciate you clarifying that. So as everyone here knows, I've been one of the leading voices for proceeding with caution on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sometimes that's not been met with enthusiasm by voices in this council chamber and some that some times that opinion has not been met with respect from all sides. So I appreciate the course of the discussion that we're having tonight and the fact that the vice mayor has recognized that we represent a very diverse city with different interests'",
        "'speaker_5': ', and that the mayor encourages everyone to be able to talk freely and honestly without intimidation and, you know, the unnecessary commentary, because it allows us to to all represent our constituents well. But I think prudence remains a great place to operate from when we're dealing with a new industry that's in the process of getting established with regulations'",
        "'speaker_5': '. This industry remains ever evolving. And it's clear to me that despite the efforts that we've made to have regulations, we're going to have to make some tweaks along the way. And I'm grateful that we have a council and an industry who's open to that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's also clear to me that the voters have voted and the will of the people has to be considered in combination with a desire to be prudent. I respect the voters and as their representative, we'll do what I can to balance their will with the possible impacts to effectuate a policy that will protect the quality of life'",
        "'speaker_5': 'concerns for my residents. I will be I have to say that I've. Been very pleased that we have not had a huge impact of illegal storefronts, although we have a great deal of illegal delivery operations in the city, which concerns me greatly that those businesses are not following the rules when it comes to health and safety.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the and most importantly, for me, as you all know, education measures, education measures for our youth education and for impaired driving, which has, in fact, gone up in Orange County. There's a 46% increase in drug impaired driving submissions to the Orange County crime lab since Proposition 64 was passed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's absolutely something we need to be educating our communities about. And so I've always been concerned about the illegal dispensaries because they have no duty or responsibility to educate, they have no duty to invest in the community. And frankly, they have no duty to make sure the product that people are getting is safe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to me, that is a huge, huge issue. So moving forward, I want to have discussions about some, you know, cracking down on the illegal delivery operations. Having said that, having said that, I'm incredibly pleased with the stores that have opened or intending to open in my district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The operators have been good communicators, responsive and very accommodating to our requests for quality of life impacts. Eliot Lewis is here. He's one. He's the first operator to operate in the third district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Day the business opened. This is a this is exactly what I would wish for for any business operator in my city. And the fact that it was a marijuana business operator set a gold standard for everybody that's going to operate in the third district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unfortunately, the standard is so high, and I'll tell you why. The night or two before the store opened, I reached out to Eliot. I said, Eliot, please, I don't want lines, hire extra bud, tenders or whatever it is you call them, but I don't want lines out the door.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He he said, don't worry, we got it covered. He put the two security guards out there. They looked intimidating. They did not look like they belonged in Belmont Shore. I told them, I said, Can you put these guys in a polo shirt, give them some khakis?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want them to be more like a greeter, like the guy outside of McCarthy's than I want somebody to be like a security guard. And within a couple of hours, he had one guard inside, one guard outside. And the guy outside is so nice and so very diligent with the regulations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think he would let me in there if I said, I'm the councilwoman. Can I come inside and see? He would say no, and I'm grateful for that. So I can honestly say that I've had we had another issue with a resident who walked by and said she smelled marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We contacted Eliot, he checked his filters, fixed the problem issue, resolved immediately within 24 hours. I can honestly say I've had zero issues with the one dispensary that's operating in my district and nothing but very positive interactions with the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Greg and the other dispensary operators who are coming into my district. So I'm very, very grateful for the partnership. They have given me a lot of peace of mind in regards to what we are to expect when recreational comes online.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have no reason to believe that they would operate any differently with recreational than they've been doing with medicinal, and that to me has meant a lot and above and beyond all of that. They have been really great partners with me in addressing my real concern, which has been the illegal dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They supported our efforts to crack down on shutting off utilities and fines in the thousands of dollars for illegal operators. That was really huge to me and I know it wasn't an easy thing for them to support because they may have colleagues operating illegally in the industry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do have concerns about some of the the impacts to the specific communities that my dispensaries are in. As those dispensary operators know, a lot of the dispensaries are located in very, very close proximity to residences. And so for me, you know, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not about when people are going to buy the product, it's about the neighborhood impacts of operating the shop. At the time that we're operating the shop on Second Street, for example, we close most retailers close at 9 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'd like to make a friendly amendment that we extend the hours or reduce them from the proposed 10 to 9, and then we can come back once these stores have been operating for six months and see what the impacts have been and consider extending it at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember I think that's very fair. It's within in city Attorney That's within what keeps it a first reading and allows us to make this a productive meeting, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Vice Mayor. Mayor Richardson, I just want to point out that what Vice Mayor Richardson just read into the record was not actually part of his motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you're part of my motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is part of your motion. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm accepting the friendly amendment from Councilwoman Price. And thank you for. Actually helping us to understand that context. I think it's fair what's proposed initially a staffer recommendation was eight. I proposed ten. You're asking nine? I think that's very meaningful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It's accepted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so just to be clear, we're going to have 9 p.m.. 9 p.m., yes. And what about delivery?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Delivery till ten until 10:00?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I love it. Ten storefronts. Nine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, yes. When you do that. Yeah. The intent there is you'd rather someone be in their home until 10:00 rather than out, out until 10:00 to pursue it if they don't need to. Right. We want that flexibility at 10:00.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that that would be an amendment to section 5.9, 2.915, and we'll make that change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor, as far as the social equity piece of it, I agree that equity is important. I understand that I support doing everything we can to give all of the residents jobs in every industry that we can in the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I, I think we should be doing more to try to get people who have criminal records, job training and employment. I don't actually just talk the talk. I walk the walk every day at work when I approve offers for on cases and dispositions on cases of, you know, I did it today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I came off of a strike charge on a woman who was going to be deported because the strike charge would have affected her negatively. I understand the need to give people second chances. I wish we would be having these conversations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just globally.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Citywide about job opportunities and job placement, not just in the marijuana industry. But I understand it's relevant to the topic tonight. I like the idea of the Community Reinvestment Report and in requiring the businesses to outline the activities that they do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also want to highlight that we do have a very diverse city. So while equity may be an important issue in some part of the city, youth education may be an important issue. In another part of the city, drivers impaired driver education may be an issue, public safety may be an issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I would hope that the partners that are working with us in our issues are talking, are in our districts, are talking about the impacts to that to the particular area that they're operating in and helping mitigate those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I look forward to working with the dispensary owners and my district to identify some of those community impacts and work together to mitigate them. So I will be supporting this item tonight, and I thank my colleagues for being involved in a very collaborative and respectful discussion, and I thank the audience for I think we've come a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'long way in terms of maturity and wisdom and so all of us. So I thank you guys for being partners. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Councilwoman Price. And just to clarify, also kind of where we're at, so we have a motion on the floor to approve the staff recommendation. There are two tweaks to that. The first is to take the 25% to a 40% goal, and the second is to move the hour of operations from 10 to 9'",
        "'speaker_1': '. That is a motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was mayor, there's third there is a third one. And that has to do with slightly changing the language to read that the first sentence of section 5.9, 2.1.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean that's a that's technical, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, it's what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tell me if there's substantive change to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yet. It has to it has to do with describing the type of it report that is that that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's fine. That's pretty technical. Okay. Then the larger changes are around those two. So that is a motion on the floor as accepted so far by Vice Mayor Richardson had. Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. I'm here. You know, I really cannot listen to what I've just heard. And I think that that's very commendable and both of you guys part. But I want to thank the staff, you know, for prepared this report and everyone has formed an opinion and brought it up, you know, to our'",
        "'speaker_8': 'council tonight. I think we need to pass something today because, you know, there are dozens of dispensaries that have followed the law in there and have been patient, you know, with us. And they have lost business because of the illegal dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I feel strongly to reward the businesses that have followed, you know, the law thus far. And with that, you know, I think that if we discover that there are things that we need to fix, I think we can discover them down the line because to do trial and error, we must start somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is why I really want to thank our councilman Rex and Mrs. Susan Price for at least getting us started in the right direction. And I think by doing that with my total recommendation, I definitely would like to get this started because I've never seen the dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, that we had come to the table and be so, you know, compassionate, honest. They've never had any. We've never had any picket outside. They came here with intent to say, look, I'm going to follow everything that the city has asked them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now they've done that. Now it's time for us to reward them and do what the right thing. And I think that to do the things that we have in our both of our attention, I think that's the right thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank Councilman Price and Susie for doing this. I mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, too. Thank you very much, Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And just to follow up on the mayor's synopsis, I'm not sure if you mentioned delivery til 10 p.m., but storefront still not delivered. Okay. Yes. I just had a question for staff and I'm moving forward on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to give them a chance to respond to the changes that are made. So, for instance, the 25% versus 40%, I assume there was some thought that went into the 25%. So here's your opportunity. If you'd like to tell us what might be problematic in going to 40% or it's no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are there any issues, impediments to go this way?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't view any impediments. Other cities have gone higher. Los Angeles is at 30% equity higher. San Francisco is at 50% equity higher. We're splitting the difference. We have a good faith requirement as part of it. So we have the flexibility to work with businesses to achieve that goal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we have a built in window of a year for businesses to hit that that target. So we think it's something we could work with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And just where where do the 25% come from? Was that best practices elsewhere or how did you arrive at that number?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We looked at we did a projection of the number of jobs that the industry could create. We compare that to the economic demographic data for the targeted areas. We also found a telling statistic with the Census Bureau that found that 25% of jobs in Long Beach are held by Long Beach residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we felt that since we were targeting a subset of the Long Beach population, that that was a realistic goal to aim for. But it's an art. It's not a science. And I think that 40% is reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, thank you. The other question I have would be on those delivery hours till 10 p.m.. What recourse would we have? Should neighbors complain about noise? We've had we've had issues with grocery delivery at that hour. So maybe the city attorney can weigh in and that what are our options moving forward?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we do allow 10 p.m. deliveries and it proves to be a problem. The recourse really would be to bring the matter back and change the delivery hour to an earlier hour that might be more compatible with the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I want to first say how much I appreciate staff's work on this. I know putting together an equity policy for a new industry in 180 days wasn't easy. So I want to applaud you guys for your efforts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm really glad I waited too, to speak. It was really great to hear my colleagues speak tonight, and I'm fully in support of the motion on the floor. I think that it shows leadership on this council's part. It shows growth and how far we've come to be able to tackle some of the difficult issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do have a couple of things that I wanted to just mention. There's no changes I want to make on the floor, but there are some substantive issues I just want to bring up quickly. One in the local hire piece and the social equity 40% number.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do agree with Councilmember Mongo on the challenges with getting to that number. And so I want to encourage staff. I've already brought it up with our assistant city manager and AJ. Some of my concerns on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I hope that in 6 to 9 months we can get a report on how we're doing. My hope and I know the city prosecutor's not here tonight, but out of everybody that can ID who has a low level offense in the city of Long Beach, a low level marijuana offense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Possibly we could get them to do some outreach first and direct them to the program. I know that we can't share that information across departments, but hopefully we can think creatively about how we ensure that that pipeline is strong so that we do meet those goals and that idea around working with our housing authority as well with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Section eight. Anything we can do to help support making sure we have that creative opportunity. I know that we're also working on, you know, an apprenticeship program and that we have to really understand as a city we're bringing on an entire industry that has been underground, but that if we've got a J if you could answer for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'me the question because I don't have the presentation in front of me, how many doors are open, whether it's grow manufacturing or retail, and how many are in the queue right now?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This could have went real bad, real south.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Other people answered it for me. 12 businesses licensed and 259 are currently in the process to obtain a license.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that to me is probably. I think that you guys have done a great job in creating this policy and creating a vision for where we want to be as a city. But that's really hard. That's I don't want to use the word embarrassing, but we have said for the last year and a half how important it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is to follow through on the will of the voters. And I know I had a long conversation with with Lynda Tatum around what are we doing? And I'm not going to insert that into this policy. But my hope is that as we move forward with the budget, we're looking at what are we doing and development services to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'make sure that not only is it a priority, but if we are generating taxes, we need to understand, we need to put money upfront to be able to open up those doors and that waiting for those tax money to come in is not going to happen unless the doors are open.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we really need, if we're going to move forward with this, to do anything we can to ensure those doors are open. Because these are small businesses that have been waiting for nine years. They have been waiting and they've been investing their life savings sometimes to do this and every month does go by.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is something that taxes them. And so I wanted to go on record, but the two things that are important to me moving forward is voting on the measure, on the motion, on the floor, making sure that there's a strong pipeline and that we're working with all departments that possibly can help us meet that goal, that we're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not just putting the goal out there. And that, too, we are doing whatever we can in our Development Services Department to make sure that we're identifying staff, whether it's an ombudsman kind of proposal or having somebody that is making sure that we don't have six months after somebody puts in a proposal until they get something back and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'then they have to go back to the drawing board. So that that was what I wanted to say. And I really appreciate, again, this council's leadership and everybody's efforts and all the businesses for believing that Long Beach was the right place to open your business and sticking it out with us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So two of the other issues that I had are I feel like there are nine dispensaries that have put their neck out there, five of which have been open since March and have paid for employees, gone through the process is really spent the time to help the city know and understand the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I believe that the dispensaries that have not opened yet have been waiting in the wings for all of you to do their work for them should have that same kind of grieving period when when you talk about the story that Councilman Price has had, where issues come up and a dispensary responds, well, they should be rewarded'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And we also need a similar time period where if a dispensary violates that, they would give up their ability to get an adult use permit. And so something that I had discussed extensively and I really had felt was important to our community was that a dispensary should have to be open as a medical dispensary before being able'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to open as an adult use. So. What that would mean is if we made it a six month limit that you had to be open for six months before being able to open as an adult, use that September one, which this ordinance would be effective August 10th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At this point, if there's a substantial change, that new substantial change should I have to introduce it at a future meeting would be effective August 17th instead of the 10th. I know that sounds life changing to some people, but I really feel strongly that for those of you who've made the investment, who've hired the staff, I've talked'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to some of you, some of you have 80% Long Beach employees. That's phenomenal. For those of you who have suffered through the 30 to 40 to 50 patients a day because you are only medical, I can only hope that you would want to be supportive, that each different business that is your competitor and your partner would go'",
        "'speaker_4': 'through that same kind of six month process where they would be evaluated by their community. There are lots of impacts of dispensaries. There are significantly less impacts of a medical dispensary. The number of customers of day of a medical dispensary is far less than a coffee shop.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the number of customers per day to an adult use facility is significantly more than a coffee shop. And so what you're talking about on these impacts to the community and the ability for a community to adjust is very, very important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I would like to know what options Mr. Richardson would be open to in allowing those of our partners who are sitting here today, the green room connected Stone Age one, love the station. All of you have been open for six months and you have a track record of no violations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so my hope would be that the five of you could open September 1st and then on a rolling basis after the dispensary has been open for six months, that others would be able to join that lead. And so I think that it's really important for that demonstrated success and proving to the community that you're a good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'partner. We've also had and many of you may or may not know we've had violators of our medicals, some of which you have locked the doors on our enforcement. And so we need that six months to be able to either walk through a process where there's a corrective action and you make those changes or you get violated'",
        "'speaker_4': ', you lose your license and it goes up to auction to one of the others of you that have already been good partners. And I would love to see a program where current Long Beach businesses who don't have violations get first stab at any license that's violated by somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The question was, would you mind narrowing the question a bit?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The question is, would you be open to a friendly that requires a dispensary to be open as a medical use for six months before being able to operate as a adult use?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not open to that at this point. I owe you more of an explanation. I'm happy to explain. My thought is if there's all. It's already taken a long time to get just throws open and once recreational happens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I don't want to see is lines of people lined up outside of dispensaries because they have a six month delay. I mean, there's going to be I mean, we need to be prepared. What we have in front of us is already complex enough.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's two tiers right now. People who are in the pipeline, people who are not. That would create a third tier of people, open people in the pipeline, people who are not in the pipeline. It will really confuse this process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do understand the merit of where you're going, and I don't want to dismiss that. My response was a little short, but that is why I believe that if we do see a problem as we move forward, the council owns this ordinance, we can move forward and make changes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that is a that changes the structure a little too much, in my opinion. That's my justification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If it was able to be included as a first reading tonight, would you be okay with that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't believe that it can. But if it could, I look to the city city I look to the city attorney on whether that's even. Mr.. Mr.. MAYS. Is that a minor change or a significant change to the structure of the ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would be a significant change to. It's not something that I would feel comfortable doing with. I question on the floor. It's certainly a policy change that we can make. But we couldn't make it this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could I think maybe we can work? There's nothing that stops us from coming back, working together on changes. Once we evaluate what this process looks like, and I'm sure that there will be changes to this ordinance. So I want you to just know this is this is going to be an ongoing process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we and it seems like from the majority of the council members that have gotten there, the integrity of the ordinance that staff has presented for the most part has gotten positive responses. And that would be a dramatic change in terms of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just don't think that that's something I hope to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, my district has more dispensaries than 50% of what's open today, and my residents have had several community meetings, and this is very important to them. And so I've brought up two items that are important to the residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've had more community meetings probably than any other council member on these items, and I feel as though when I discuss this with city staff that we should have been put in a position where an item was come into the agenda, where we could have had more flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I really want to be supportive of this item tonight, and I will again thank those of the dispensaries who have spoken to me. If you're a dispensary that's in my district and you're giving me opinions tonight, shame on you that you didn't call your councilmember before that because I have six in my district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Six and not all of you. Actually, less than half of you have reached out. And quite honestly, most of the reach out have been from the dispensaries in the other districts. I really appreciate many of you that are open and have made those efforts and I feel that those of the dispensaries that are in my district that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have come to community meetings, I feel that you've heard the voices of the neighbors who feel very strongly about a performance period. And so we will work and see what we can do to find a way to make that happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And lastly, we have Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, this was a really great discussion. I'm also glad that I sort of waited in the wings and listened to what happened today. It has been a long, long road for so many of all of us, on many very various sides.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm just glad that we're here today talking about this. And I do believe, you know, we certainly have to move this forward as well. I, I understand, you know, and in my district, overwhelmingly supportive of recreational marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But on top of that, we do have some things that absolutely we have to think about. And I know that these are included in the ordinance. And I really appreciate the very thorough ordinance that includes all of the details.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It seems like no detail was left out, which I truly appreciate, that it was very mindful and it was with the approach that, you know, working with business, working with the UFC, working with all of the players. Of course, I'll just reiterate, I know it's been discussed many times over various years on the city council, even city'",
        "'speaker_5': 'councils prior. But of course, major education on the do's and don'ts of where you can and cannot smoke. I have a lot of residents who constantly complain and all of this is aside from the ordinance, but just constantly complain about smoke in their home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know that that is a major quality of life issue for a lot of individuals. And so thinking about ways that we can do some pieces around that to make it more of a robust discussion and also maybe working with a property owners and apartment association to be able to include those types of messages for those'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for that issue. And then the same as Councilwoman Price, the illegal deliveries and the. Eagle storefronts. I know we're still battling that, and it absolutely compromises the competition that our legal dispensaries and legal deliveries are currently going through in that we need to just nix right away in any way, any way, shape or form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I am going to keep belaboring that issue. But, you know, it's a big deal. And then lastly, I really appreciate that. Well, it's state mandated, but, you know, I know that just being able to the product packaging and advertising for youth, I think we see that a lot in the vapor side of things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But being able to really do something very creative here locally because we do have a lot of youth, especially now, as I mentioned, with vaping and all of that. I have a 17 year old at home and just the thought of him picking up something and thinking it's, I don't know what and it's bubblegum and it's packaged'",
        "'speaker_5': ', you know, for kids and youth and directed towards that. So with all that said, those are like my three main things that I think I've heard a lot about just being a mom, but also just representing a lot of parents myself I wanted to make sure we brought forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But again, I look forward to seeing this through. It's going to be a big benefit for us and we'll see what that looks like in terms of tax revenue and the return on investment for the city and where that will lead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. With that members, we have a motion in front of us that by Benjamin Richardson and customary Ringo. Please cast your votes. Well, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I thought I would make one last plea to the vice mayor. Okay. Mr. Vice Mayor, do you understand that I have more. You and I have the most dispensaries of all city. You and I combine four more dispensaries and 70% of the sale.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What about an item that allows for home delivery immediately? Ready? One. But you have to be open as a store front for six months before you can sell at the storefront.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Home delivery is already very active in our city today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm talking about adult use home delivery by my by authorized dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How are you going to police that? It is a large, broad conversation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Look, I know our dispensaries are choosing not to do home delivery of adult use because they don't want to violate. We'd be opening that door for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Has this proposal been vetted by staff? Have you talked to the city attorney? Have you talked with the industry? Has been has been because none of every proposal that's come up has been sort of developed through the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know what I don't want to do is deviate too far from the integrity of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have discussed, as with city attorney, he said it would be more substantial than originally expected. I discussed several of these things with city staff a week ago, none of which was folded in because it was bifurcated, but it was important to the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have met with members of the industry and there is just a huge community impact and it is completely disrespectful to the community that some of the dispensaries that are not open yet are waiting in the wings until the day adult use is available and then they're just going to open up and steal a lot of customers'",
        "'speaker_4': 'from. Some of you have been up in open for a long time. You should have first rate to the market and first rate to those individuals.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So those are gonna be the next two items. We're taking a one minute recess. I want to get to those items and then the regular agenda.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You know. They did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they did not meet any other goals. I wrote about it the other day. They're like, You don't require they do anything. And if they don't, they don't do anything because it wasn't God, it was a CFS.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Report from staff that it's I think we're going to do them at the same time, but two different items. Okay. So let's go ahead and do the suicide prevention plan.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening again. Before you, tonight is a request to amend the city's regulations for massage uses in accordance with recent changes in state law. There some background on state law, but basically in 2008, the state prevented local jurisdictions from regulating massage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have since updated the state law, which does allow us to regulate massage uses as long as they have certification. This pertains to Title five and Title 21 of the Municipal Code. Title five hasn't been updated since 1988 and so clearly is outdated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then also Title 21 treated massage uses as adult entertainment businesses and state law now prohibits us from doing that. So those are the causes of the two updates. The proposed Title five amendments, like I mentioned, have to do with reflecting state law, but it also basically allows for massage businesses to operate not only just as accessory'",
        "'speaker_4': ', but also as primary uses. And it has a whole licensing system that's proposed. And then Title 21, like I mentioned, would remove massages from adult entertainment uses, allow them to be permitted as massages, and require an administrative use permit, which is a process that requires a public hearing application fees and has conditions of approval to allow us'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to enforce the massage uses. There is a buffer of 750 feet that separates primary Massachusetts, and that's one of the most important details about location. So the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on this in February and has recommended that the Council approve this application.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what Andrew's council member. Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you, guys, for all your work on this. I had some clarifying questions. It was stated to me in the briefing that this brought us into alignment with the state rules and regulations on massage parlors. Can you clarify, does the state allow for a massage therapist to get a license and practice massage in her home or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'his home? Yes. So this ordinance would not allow for massage has to be a home occupation. So that is that is the state might allow for certification and allow for somewhere for operation in a home. But our ordinance does not allow that was my question because I was told that we were being brought up to alignment with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the state. And then once I looked at this in detail, found out that that part was not included as somebody. My grandmother was a massage therapist. She had a half of her home dedicated to that business. And I have several residents have reached out to my office that have been frustrated with the system and Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so it was my hope and expectation that this would align with the state level on that. So could I get some clarity on why we might have left that out? I, I would just like to just say that we were essentially looking at the inconsistencies in state law in the sense that our code was really outdated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Terms of how massage is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Treated as a professional service. It's changed over time. In our code. We're still in a period where massage was treated as an adult use, essentially, so our code really needed to be brought up to speed. So the fundamental change that we made was to not consider an adult use, but to change kind of how it was classified'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as a professional service, which is what it's generally recognized as today. So the state law is probably more permissive than the local law, and ours was essentially putting in place regulations to essentially regulate it as a professional service under generally the same standards, which is as a professional business as opposed to a home occupation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So what changes would need to be made to allow for somebody to to conduct this professional business, our home business, a lot of misuse start in their home before they open up a storefront. So I want to, you know, make sure that I'm responding to my constituents concerns on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We currently do have home occupation, a home occupation permit, and there are a number of occupations that that can be done in the home, but there are some.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That could not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the message at this point is one of those that is not authorized, because we didn't change the code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We didn't anticipate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Having massages done in the home. This was strictly massage as a a business opportunity. So my question might be for for the city attorney or what would need to be done to make that change? Can we make that change today or do we need to make that change somewhere else?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe we'd have to come back because the zoning code would also have to be amended and that would have to go through a planning commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can we get a motion in a second? And Councilwoman Margot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So two additional points that were brought up by massage therapist storefronts in my district. I don't believe this can be folded in tonight, but I would like to see if there are currently storefronts that have expanded and they have multiple facilities now within the city limits and currently under the current business licensing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you are a hairdresser, someone who does nails, someone who gives massages, you actually need to get a business license at each and every address that you execute according to what they were told by development services when they came here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if that is true, I'll try to work with you over the next several weeks so that when those licensing fees come back to the Council through the budget process, that perhaps we could find a way that they wouldn't need multiple licenses, they could just do a small add on per location or something along those lines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because what we're hearing is now that they're opening multiple locations, it's getting difficult for the massage therapists to move between facilities when demand changes. And so they're looking at opening a third one, but they won't open one now because of this restriction and they don't want to have a whole new staffing process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if we could look at that between now and then, it would be great if that came back through the budget cycle. Thank you. We can certainly work with the finance department to look at the business licensing because that's a business license.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Understand the concern and we'll.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Work with finance to address that issue. Appreciate it. And it would be for people who come here and provide nail supply services and massage services. They all have the same licensing mechanism. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And that's the final. We already called to comment on this. I think we did. Is there any public comment? Okay, so please cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Let's move on to the consent calendar. Can we keep the consent calendar, please? Okay. So I made the motion. I don't see a second here. Is there a second on the calendar? Okay. It's been moved in.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We have two items are related to fire fireworks. So those are item 26 and 46. One is an item by Councilwoman Price. I think the other one is a report on fireworks from the fire department. Councilman, should we hear the report first from the fire department and then the item or how did you want to'",

    "Report and Presentation on Illegal Firework Issues and Solutions.": [
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I wanted to have our citizen group come up first, if that's okay. Sure. I think that's first on the item. And just to be clear, there's there's no relationship between the two reports. We usually get a report from fire leading into 4th of July on their outreach efforts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I hope to do that. But but as if we can take up the item 26/1 and I can give a little bit of an intro. So so we have before our residents begin talking, I wanted to just highlight a few things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So probably about eight months ago or so, one of the third District residents can Weiss, who's here, reached out to me. Ken is an active member of the third District and Long Beach resident and often brings forth suggestions on issues that he's observed in the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And he and many other neighbors in the city of Long Beach, and especially on the coastal areas, have expressed a lot of concern about the use of illegal fireworks every year. So Ken suggested that we put together kind of a citizen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Group that studies the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Issue, that calls other cities to find out what their rules are, that looks at outreach efforts, that looks at opportunities for improvement for city wide practices. This group of individuals spent countless hours. I can't even begin to tell you how hard they worked on this completely volunteer task, and their only goal was to come up with some'",
        "'speaker_5': 'recommendations that the city can incorporate. And I'm happy to report they're going to go through their recommendations, but that our the council office has actually started to implement some of the recommendations, including a PSA. I know the city already does.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'PSA is what we hired a recent graduate from Cal State Long Beach's film school to help us create a PSA that was, you know, hip with the with the teens so the teen age group. And so they've already, you know, been working on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They've shot the PSA and they're working on First Cut. So we're in the process of that. But I wanted to just recognize this group of residents, let them do a presentation on what they've done and tell you their names.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have Ken Weiss, who's here with us tonight, Eric Whitten, who's going to be doing the presentation for us. Sandra Rangel, Leslie Patterson, David Val Tierra, Jeff Dawson, Peter Hodgkinson and Jason Bollman. So these are our residents who were served on this committee, and I want to thank you on behalf of the City Council for your'",
        "'speaker_5': 'excellent work and for the folks in the back. I don't think this is the presentation that we're going to queue up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Did it did you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Guys send it? Yes. Okay. So hold on 1/2. Let's see. It's got some fireworks on the front cover, the white background.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jack. Did they get it? I look. There we go. Okay, so, Eric, take it away.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and council for having us here. This has been a really wonderful process for all of us to learn to come together and learn as total strangers to take on an issue and and try and and see where it takes us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What I have here tonight at five, the next slide is to describe the process that we went through. We had two separate parts of this. One was the city departments that are involved and or impacted by fireworks. And what do the other cities do?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you can see here, we had an extensive list of of departments and cities that we spoke to and met with in person over about a four month period. We had 21 sessions and more than 344 committee hours in a four month period to take a look at what people are doing with regard to fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the next slide, this is kind of the CliffsNotes version of what we found. And on the left hand side, I'd like to call your attention to the emergency call center this last 4th of July. These numbers are for last 4th of July.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's were 3200 calls received by the emergency call center in a 24 hour period. And this was about a 60% increase over a normal operational period. So the workload for the call centers is really, really significant. On July 4th, there were 1365 calls that were directed for a response.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And of that, 1092 were fireworks related. And in the period between a 45 minute period, between 830 and 915, there were 715 calls from from residents to the call center. And of these calls, there were 40 felony and misdemeanor arrests and 40, 46 citations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And to compare that, we looked at July 3rd also, and I only want to summarize that that call volume on July 3rd was 1000 calls. We also discovered that there's a lot of calls that we're holding. And so that becomes a significant impact to the enforcement of the four fireworks rules that the police have to deal with'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in the collective agency. We listed all of the things that we found here that have to be dealt with or were dealt with actually on July 4th. And there's a lot of medical responses. Both rescues assist at the beach, the arson department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So department. But that unit, they they made 11 block party visits and issued five citations and confiscated 150 of illegal fireworks. The actionable results just in review of that and I wanted to mention, because this was very significant, that the police department seized 7,000 of illegal fireworks prior to July 4th.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can only imagine what would have happened if they hadn't had done that. But there were a total of 80, 86 citations, 46 citations and 40 felony arrests, which I think was pretty significant. But by comparison to the number of calls for service, I think there was quite a few residents that were not happy about the response'",
        "'speaker_8': '. On the next slide is the police department's logs for that night. So you can see that they're quite busy. And in fact, we talked to Commander Herzog, and in the police department, it's essentially all hands on deck that there are no days off, there are no special circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Everybody has to work because of the high call volume. And we think that probably is a big impact on morale for the police department. Have to do this because we're all enjoying July 4th except for the police department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe this held true for the fire department, too, and the Marine patrol. So essentially what you have is all the public safety personnel are on duty on July 4th. That also relates or results in somewhere. And we didn't do an audit and we didn't look at people's budgets and we didn't really calculate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what we did was take a look at some some averages. And it looks like maybe the cost for overtime on July 4th may be as high as $600,000. So doing something about fireworks has a fiscal impact as well as a morale impact and has an impact for the community at large.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the next slide, we took a look at the Long Beach animal shelter and it's hard to read these numbers and it didn't turn out quite straight. But what happened was that the animal shelter collects a lot of stray dogs and cats that are loose on July 4th and only in 2017, only 39% of them were returned'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So it turned out that animal control is all hands on deck also, and they're overloaded with animals on July 4th. So our recommendations are kind of we looked at the whole group of what does a city do and what do they have possible right now?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in the winter, when you look at what the police and the fire department have to do, all of the enforcement right now is criminal enforcement, which requires the policemen or the firemen to actually witness the lighting of a fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when you recognize the calls you're holding for service, the police don't get the call or the fire, too. Don't get the call until after the fireworks are even lit. So the ability of the of the police and the fire to see the lighting and the fireworks is in our estimate was pretty, pretty impossible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we need to come up with another strategy to get the message out to to the public. And so what we believed was for the Long Beach Fire Department, they were significantly involved in pieces and doing an excellent job.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what we wanted to do is support that. Let everyone know that that is happening. But what we thought is a recommendation is that the social science research and social websites and social videos and contacts and things like that is evolving very, very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the fire department needs to take a look at that. We found that the impact of fireworks tends to be more on the younger side than on the older side, like old guys like me. The you know, I'm not going to be a problem for fireworks, but some some are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The next step is administrative code enforcement. We discovered that there's a mechanism in the city to have administrative code enforcement for fireworks penalties. Or there's it's in the code, but there's no mechanism to actually carry it out. The only mechanism to carry out enforcement is through misdemeanor and felony contact.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think we put our police officers, officers and our arson unit in a very difficult position to be successful when they have to witness the lighting of the fireworks. And we find that that doesn't really happen. So we would like to recommend that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city. Take a look at code enforcement. And I'm not speaking of the code enforcement necessarily, like on housing codes and water heaters and things like that. I'm talking about more of an administrative process of the fireworks code.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Long Beach Police Department in the short term could also take a look at that and provide input on that. But I do the committee believe that we they're in an ineffective position to actually witness this. So there's got to be another another focused on a mechanism that is not as stringent as a criminal criteria that requires'",
        "'speaker_8': 'witnesses, that doesn't rely on other forms of evidence, like a neighbor report I saw it or a video even or photographs of a party going on were lots of fireworks. The other thing that we had recommended to Miss Price was data collection is kind of a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not really happening. We have a lot of data on what responses are and who does what, but what neighborhoods are impacted the most. And so we've recommended to go Long Beach be extended so that people could maybe report the fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They know that there's not going to be anything, no police response as a result of that. But it could take a load off of the call center and it would be a mechanism to collect data so that the next year the plans can be fine tuned based on data as opposed to let's just put everybody out there'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and let them go where they're called, which sort of I am critical of that because they do go where they're cold, but maybe they don't have to go to every call that that was the community's point. And then in the long term, I'll go through there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're essentially extensions of these short term recommendations. And then you can see up there some of the administrative enforcement concept was that the administrative citations can be citations and warnings that we felt more could be issued by the city attorney so that if the call center takes a call, we would ask them to get the address so'",
        "'speaker_8': 'they could then compile an address and maybe a response is not required, but they could forward that address to the city attorney, who then could send what we called a courtesy letter to say, Hey, we just want to remind you that fireworks are illegal and there's no criminal penalty.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're not putting Dad in jail because he was trying to have fun with his kids. But we're getting the message out. So when you take a look at this list, there's there's citations that go through the city attorney's office.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And maybe I'm speaking incorrectly about the city attorney. Maybe it's a city prosecutor. We didn't try to determine who would do that. But there also could be different evidence requirements so that maybe if if the violation is severe enough and someone has submitted a video of people lighting fireworks, say, in one of our parks, then that would'",
        "'speaker_8': 'rise to a different level for the city attorney to maybe pursue a citation or some other action. But it would keep the police and keep the fire department focused on things that may be more important on July 4th that they can't get to because they're dealing as best they can with a fireworks situation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's really a no win for them. And so I would like to make those short recommended more, but I thought this kind of summed up what we found and gave you a good feeling for what we did do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to thank you on behalf of the Third District for spending as much time as you did. It's unbelievable to me that you guys would have volunteered 344 hours to researching something you care about. And I appreciate the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I thought you did a nice job highlighting the great work of our fire and police departments and understanding the challenges that they face. There are some recommendations there that are certainly recommendations that we're going to follow up. And the first is the PSA that we hope to get into the schools, which I think is important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But also the administrative citation option is something that my staff is researching now to bring back as a potential agenda item in the future. So I want to thank you and Ken for your service and for sharing with us your recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's unusual to gather a group of residents together to research a subject like this, but this is something that you're very passionate about, and you definitely rooted your energy to a very productive place. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I just want to I just want to thank you guys also. I think that that's a lot of time for community members to go in and just do the level of research that you did on a topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a very important topic across the city. And so I just want to thank you guys and the whole committee as well. Well, thank you. I wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank the councilman's office, she and her office, because they.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for your suggestions. I think the go Long Beach up add on is really important. We're already having issues with fireworks in January and so we've had even more recently and I think with the administrative process, the go long recap is helpful because when our Assistant Chief Brant and I were in an area last year'",
        "'speaker_4': 'watching fireworks go off, it's easy for everyone to videotape the fireworks. But soon as the cars come, the fire department or the police department, everyone runs and scatters versus with the go Long Beach up, you could actually take a picture of the person lighting the firework and save that into the app in the same way that you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'take a picture of the broken sidewalk. So great idea. I whispered to Councilwoman Price that if they are doing fireworks, perhaps their community service could be required on 4th of July the next year. So they couldn't possibly be lighting fireworks again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I really appreciate the work that you've done, and I may have a few residents who are interested in talking with you more specifically because they have their own kind of dialog about the same issues that we've been having over on the fifth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for your work very well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to echo I knew that Councilmember Mongo was going to talk about the goby job. I think that's a great idea. If we could figure out a way to work with the city attorney's office or somebody like that to send some letters, sometimes all people need to know somebody is watching.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I know in my district also a beach neighborhood, we have a big issue as well. And so let me know how my office can get involved with you guys and any of our neighborhood leaders as well and keep up the great work.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, I cannot thank the council Councilwoman Price well enough to bring in this item forward. You know, bringing this fireworks, you know, beginning at the fireworks are illegal in parts of the state. But I know that it is tough to control them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we really do need to try, you know, as a city to put some sort of prevention, education and enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On this issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My residents, especially the ones in the regular area, deserve some sort of peace of mind. They heard illegal fireworks and those being set off in the Wilmington area. I know my office requested a meeting minutes from the fireworks advisory committee from June 5th.'",

Mayor Garcia and members of the City Council. Mike Derry, I'm be providing you an update with the city's outreach education enforcement efforts leading up to the 4th of July holiday week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our primary public safety mission is to ensure that residents and visitors celebrate the holiday safely in our city. So at the Spacebar, the Fire and Police Department started planning for the holiday several months ago, as has been consistent over over the past number of years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Public outreach and enforcement will remain the primary focus areas to ensure a safe 4th of July. Outreach education efforts have been designed to communicate the message to residents and visitors that all fireworks, including those marked safe and sane, are dangerous and illegal in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That even fireworks that may seem benign can be very dangerous, especially when handled by children. Items such as sparklers and sky lanterns can cause great harm and pose a significant fire risk. The National Fire Protection Administration reports national, a national annual average of 18,500 fires caused by fireworks, including 1300 structure fires, 300 and over 300 vehicle fires'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Nationwide, these fires caused an annual average of three deaths, 40 civilian injuries and $43 million in direct property damage. In 2015, hospital emergency rooms treated an estimated of 11,900 people for fireworks related injuries. Children under the age of 15 years old are accounted for, accounted for about 35% of the estimated injuries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As in past years, the city has convened a fireworks stakeholder task force, which includes residents, elected officials, city departments and veterans groups. For the past several months, the fire department has been working with all city departments to coordinate public service announcements, press releases, and communicating that all fireworks are dangerous and illegal in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Announcements are also being displayed in highly, highly visible locations such as parks and libraries. Other outreach efforts include posting on electronic marquee signs, fliers, banners, posters and the distribution of hundreds of lawn signs. In addition to utilizing the city's website to get out the message that all fireworks are illegal in Long Beach, the city is using all'",

Additionally, the Animal Control Bureau is distributing educational materials to the community, advising pet owners of ways to mitigate the impacts of fireworks on their pets. As you can imagine, the loud noises of fireworks caused pets a great amount of stress and anxiety, leading many of'",

Fireworks can cause flashbacks and anxiety for some military veterans with PTSD. Fire staff has met with the Long Beach Veterans Commission. And just this afternoon we met with a contingent of the Veterans Commission to discuss and hear their concerns regarding this issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another way we encourage a safe 4th of July is by visiting block parties. Fire crews visit every 4th of July block party throughout the city and speak about the illegality and dangers of all fireworks. BLOCK parties are regulated by the city and permits are required.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Organizers must sign a permit that states the block party shall end at 7 p.m. and also stresses that all fireworks are illegal and requires block party permits to comply or participants to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Permits will be revoked revoked if illegal activity occurs, and that, of course, includes any use of fireworks. The 4th of July is the busiest day of the year for both the police and fire departments. Last year, the communications center center handled over 3000 calls for service on July four alone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This represents about a 60% increase in a call volume from a normal day. From July 1st to July 5th, 2017. The communications center received over 1200 fireworks related calls in 2017. Police and fire issued 46 fireworks citations. And this is an increase from 2016 in which 33 citations were issued.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The police department also seized over 7,000 of illegal fireworks last year, placed this year in an effort to respond to increased reports of illegal fireworks on the night of July one through July five. The fire department will deploy two additional patrol vehicles, each staffed with two arson investigators.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These additional units will work in conjunction with the police department's proactive patrols. Patrols will continue to target areas of the city historically known for frequent use of fireworks, as well as respond to reports of illegal fireworks activity citywide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anyone cited or arrested for fireworks violations may be issued a $1,000 fine, sentenced to jail for up to six months or both. Issuing citations for fireworks use is also uniquely challenging, as an arson investigator or police officer must witness a person in the act in order to issue the citation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additionally, citations are often confrontational and arson investigators and police officers. Safety is a primary concern. Fireworks may be this year voluntarily disposed of at collection bins, which are located at all fire and police stations and at lifeguard headquarters.'",

Even though some residents reported seeing an increase.'",

But I think that both departments were really excellent in serving as a as a resource to the committee of residents.'",

You're starting to see them spring up at starting with fire stations and police stations throughout the city. Today, in fact, we even took it a step farther and we're going to produce some lawn signs that specifically address our veterans community, alerting neighbors that, you know'",

        "'speaker_10': 'That is a great obstacle in terms of being able to get more citations and get the word more spread out in terms of the the the illegality of having fireworks. But if people are are caught in the act, I think that that would be a great deterrent.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Mayor. Just wanted to just chime in at every year, you know, we go out, we do education. You know, sometimes we do bus and things. I remember when we collected thousands of dollars of illegal fireworks. All good work.'",

Other other folks have said it seems like the issue continues to grow and perpetuate of where I am. We border, Compton, Paramount, Lakewood, Bellflower, all different rules and fireworks and all those different cities it's almost impossible to keep up with from one side'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the district. Sounds like a war zone. The other side might be a little bit more quiet. So I want to just lift up two things. So, one, I like the idea of an app or technology. I think there has to be some sort of technology solution that helps engage local residents into helping to self-police their own'",
        "'speaker_2': 'communities. I mean, the lawn signs gave them a tool to start that I actually saw on certain blocks. The people who engage with a lot of signs, I saw that they you know, they saw an immediate response that those blocks where people engaged with those lawn signs, they stopped doing it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe the block over was doing it, but those particular blocks stopped doing illegal fireworks. I think we if we really took some time and thought about how to leverage the app, we might be able to figure something out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Secondly, I had this idea before, and I think we should pick some areas, some random areas around town where we literally set up some things like we can literally set it up in a park, let's say let's say Coolidge Park or the Forest Park or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You grab a park, you, you know, you set up a tent. It is your firework fire watch for the neighborhood and it's randomized your firewatch. And guess what? From that place you do targeted sort of education, outreach and and enforcement all surrounding that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then the next year you pick it up somewhere else. I just think something like a visible, hey, we are here, we see you, we all catch you and we're not going anywhere. We're going to be right here at this park and we're going to see everything in this and, you know, surrounding areas, something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should we should try because at a minimum, we'll be able to show the residents, hey, you know where we were. We weren't in your neighborhood this time. We can be in your neighborhood next time. It's limited resources, but we have to sort of, you know, begin that process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just an idea. Every year folks have ideas. We try to figure this out. And, you know, that's just what we have to do. That's our plight. Thanks, Candy. Think about that. The chief, the roving sort of a firewatch and different parks or neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Vice Mayor, I can tell you that the fire department and the police department actively are doing our best to engage the community throughout the city of Long Beach in community meetings and meetings that we've invited city staff to and community members to, certainly we would we would consider anything that would hands our ability to reach the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'community and inform them on the dangers and the illegality of fireworks. So it's something that I think we would consider and we talk through the best way we could possibly carry like carry something like that out. Sure.'",

The building design is a it's a 36 foot tall building in typical gymnasium, and it's a pretty nice design and that's in your plans as well.'",

But we should be looking more aggressively at turning those systems off more quickly. San Diego just did an assessment where they took three weeks to assess what could go into the cloud and how quickly.'",

But I, too, want to emphasize the cloud strategy, whether it's, you know, not at one point in the staff report did we even mention cloud.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think moving into a 21st century, you know, innovative, we have an 18 we're sort of like that. We are that city that's moving in that direction that we didn't even address that in the staff report at all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think absolutely. We do need to have a strategy for that at some point, whether it's, you know, not all, because I know that's difficult for us coming from from where we're at now, but at least some sort of momentum towards that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It will absolutely help with capital costs and lowering those and providing more efficiencies, I think, on the back end, as well as security. And then secondly, electronic document management system is included in that. And I think that's just kind of I feel like a broken record.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we have talked over and over again. I know Councilmember Mongeau and myself about local businesses being included, especially with these large projects. And I understand the cooperative purchasing agreement process. But just an example, companies like laser fish who absolutely have the ability to have to do the or conduct the idms are not even included in this'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this whole plan. And that's a lot of businesses. It's a huge business. I know they could have done it and they actually have they are within a cooperative, cooperative purchasing alliance, which is called the National Cooperative Purchasing Alliance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's not as though we couldn't get those same prices with a local vendor. So I just need to to see that because it's a value of this council. And I think we've we've said that multiple times. If there's a way down the line to include them or if they do hit all the qualifications or to include'",
        "'speaker_5': 'any local businesses, I would just emphasize that we do that as much as possible. And then just to reiterate as well with Councilmember Mongo said, you know, just looking at sort of new technologies, moving ahead. And then lastly, I guess my question is about the cybersecurity features.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What would that look like? And I know we've had two emails that have been suspicious in the last couple of weeks, I believe. And so what are our thoughts around the cybersecurity strategy?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess I can take? Councilwoman Gonzalez. I was one point of clarification. The doc, the document management that's listed in this is for the hardware equipment, not for the actual systems. So. So just a clarification on that. Okay, good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then in terms of our cybersecurity, we have a multifaceted approach, including the purchase and procurement of a variety of tools. That includes things like endpoint tools, penetration testing, intrusion detection, data loss prevention, access control tools, firewall and CRM, which is like a information incident, event management, security and information event management type tool.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So so we do are we are actively working on our cybersecurity, and this would take us a big step forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. And going alongside with what Councilmember Mungo said, the 100, did you mention 120 days to come back for a strategy? Okay. I would just like to say that that would be a great opportunity for us to see dig a little bit deeper in those those two issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And just to clarify, these motions would be on top of the recommendations in the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll clarify that and. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. So most interesting. And that's why I want to actually clarify. I think the city attorney is looking for the same thing. So there there there was a stat there was one staff report for actually four separate motions and four separate items that are actually five items.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry, I misspoke, but yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so they're all and they're all five. Obviously, different tech technology needs. And so I just want to make sure that we're clarifying and then depending on the answer, I want to I want to also make some comments so I can clarify the this in addition to these five was sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's the five items and in addition the the item that is in front of us, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Perfect. So we'll we'll we'll do that. So we have six items to vote on. Or actually, we can just wrap that into the to the first item. So go member council member Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I just wanted to go on record for also supporting what my colleagues have mentioned here today. I think that we need to push ourselves to think outside the box, to be as wireless as possible, to work with the cloud.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I wanted to just clarify again that this wasn't the laser fish RFP stuff that we've been talking about, that that's a separate item. Great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Got to go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I just had one additional question. Is there any way that any it looks like from the motion that anyone that's in the national IPA, TCP and could be selected. So if another one of your vendors so say for instance we talked a little bit about the negotiated pricing that you had on all of these desk'",
        "'speaker_4': 'devices. Should the decision be made that we don't need 30,000 head of phones on people's desks, that we can get down to 1500 and the price goes up considerably because of the negotiated deal, you would be able to use any other of the if whatever.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know, Leon, it takes in CPA vendors or do I need to add that back in as long as it comes to an individual cost less than what we are approving at this time? Councilwoman. Correct. Any of these piggyback cooperative agreements, we could go back with a different amount of phones and get different pricing because what I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'don't want is the particular quote that we have at this time to decide to try to lock you in because we're going to use significantly less. So I just want to give you that flexibility. And if you need another vendor off that list, I'm completely comfortable with it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that there's plenty others that we use in L.A. County that I think are also more local than Texas. So.'",
