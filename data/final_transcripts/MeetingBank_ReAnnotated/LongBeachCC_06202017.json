    "Ordinance and Report on Elevator Repairs and Enforcement.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Kane. Motion carries. Thank you. Item 26. Congratulations. Congratulations on having.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication from Councilwoman Gonzales, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Mango. Recommendation to request the city attorney to draft an ordinance to regulate elevator repairs related to equipment failure and across the city manager to report within 120 days on the current elevator code enforcement procedures, incentives for property owners and policy recommendations for hardship reimbursement to disabled persons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, I. This has been actually an item in the making for many, many years. And I first would like to thank one of my residents, the first district resident who is extremely passionate about advocacy for individuals with disabilities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I would like to recognize her. Frances, Emily, Dawson, Harris. I think everyone knows her, so let's give her a big round of applause. I'd like to thank her because not only is she an advocate, she's still very active in the community, but about, I would say, five or six years ago or so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I remember connecting with her over the holidays and it happened that she was actually confined to her building for 73 days because of an ongoing equipment failure with the elevator. It is an unfortunate thing situation that occurred and now many years later, now being on the council, I wanted to make sure that we got this address and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we got it right. And so this this will ask the city attorney to look into drafting an ordinance for various things. I mean, we're going to ask for a current elevator code enforcement procedures violations to make sure that we are getting it right and that repairs are done right away, not 73 days later, that they're done in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'an efficient and a timely manner. And so there are roughly about 45,000 people living with disabilities, 55% of whom with live with ambulatory disabilities, and a total of 42,835 seniors in Long Beach. There are over 30 senior buildings and many large multifamily buildings within Long Beach, and many of them reside in the First District.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Individuals with mobility impairments sued the New York City Housing Authority because they failed to maintain its elevator in working conditions. The lawsuit resulted in a supplement settlement agreeing agreement requiring the New York the city of New York to repair elevators within 24 hours.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So a member of the provincial parliament of Trinity Hendon put forth a bill to amend Canada's current law with respect to elevators or crying repairs. And I and I know and I think that Long Beach can certainly do better.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'd also like to thank my staff member, Jennifer Kumi. I'm a back here who also worked with Francis in drafting this ordinance and works as well as the founder of the Wheelchair, Miss Wheelchair California, but also for her advocacy and making sure that this saw city council's desk.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So with that said, I hope my council colleagues can support this item. We'll ask for report back in 120 days. But I think it's a definitely a great item for us to ensure that we are improving the working and living conditions of many individuals who happen to have disabilities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez for bringing this forward. It's a very important item. As we all remember a couple of years ago when we had our power outage, there were a number of people who were stranded in their buildings because they couldn't get down because of elevator operators.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think it's important that we address this as quickly as we can. But I'd also like to ask a question from our staff. Do we require buildings to have emergency sleds, especially those that are multi-story buildings? I don't believe so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. If a council member would indulge me, I would like to make an amendment to the motion. If we can have our staff also look at requiring an emergency sled, emergency evacuation, sleds in buildings that are over five stories to ensure that if there is a power failure or there is a fire or there's another emergency or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'there's a power failure that these emergency sleds would be available to in buildings that are five stories or greater.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely. I'd be happy to include that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. I'd like to welcome that amendment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. I, too, want to thank my colleague for her foresight to to consider this. I think sometimes we find ourselves in situations that seem isolated or building by building, but it makes sense to try to make sure that there's protection for those.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I to remember folks in the second District being trapped in their buildings at a time whenever our electricity went out. I have to just clarifying questions. One I'd like to ask the colleague, you're Roberto Duran. Is there a reason for five stories instead of maybe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Three.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No? I mean, whatever the consumer goods dollars would be available to, I just thought that five would be it would be the a threshold. But that's really available to 2 to 3. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, great. So if we could just look into that as a whole for any two story or three story buildings. Great. My second question is for the city attorney and just clarifying, because it says city attorney and it says city manager to request back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So just clarify. This is a report to come back and then we would then do an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The I was just going to ask I actually I was queued up to speak to ask that very question. I think there are some issues of preemption when you're dealing with elevators in the state of California. All elevators are overseen by the Department of Industrial Relations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I think if we could the motion would be to do this study during which time we could look into what the options are. Available to the City Council for an ordinance and then include that in the report that comes back to you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we get further direction to prepare whatever ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, that was the intention of this. And thank you for. Thank you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Thank you. And I'm proud to be a cosigner on this. And thank you for all the work that you did, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I'm sure city attorney. I know you were a cutup. Did you have anything else or did you already know? Okay, then, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I want to thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez and the rest for bringing this item forward. I will certainly support it. I think it merits the city staff looking into ways to improve and support the health and welfare of our residents, and particularly those who are most vulnerable in older buildings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'City attorney kind of preempted me because I did have some questions regarding jurisdiction over inspections and who governs elevators, but I think this is a great item. I'll be certainly supportive. And then to any young people out there looking at future careers, I will tell you that there's always a shortage of elevator mechanics throughout the state and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'throughout the country. And so it's a great, great career that pays very, very well. So if you want to get a strategic advantage on on a career option, become an elevator mechanic, because obviously there's going to be a need.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to give a great, great, great bit of gratitude to the first District staff member who put an exceptional amount of work into the persistence of the community. This is a really important matter that often comes up only when it is too late when an emergency has occurred.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we are looking forward to the opportunity to find what we are able to do. And if it only means that from here forward new buildings that are built, the city has the ability to put some restrictions in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that we would go that direction, but we just need to be mindful of our scope and span of control and whatever we can do to make the world a more mobile friendly place for all of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for your patience and cooperation in this important matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you very much, Mayor. First of all, I'd like to thank Our Lady Gonzales for bringing this item forward because of the fact that any time you speak of our senior citizens, which I am one myself, you know, and we talk about exits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this is a wonderful idea. And I was glad that both of our council members here talked about our height, because the fact that a lot of our seniors do live in very high places. But this is a very, very important item that you brought to the diocese year because the fact that a lot of us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do. That's the only way of getting to and both to our, you know, place of residency. So thank you again, Mrs. Gonzales, for bringing this forward, and I truly will support it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. I also wanted to acknowledge Heather in our city for working on many of these issues as well as Delores from the Disabled Resource Center. Thank you both for being here as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, thank you very much. We're going to have any public comment on this item. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're going to. Okay. You.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I am Francis. Emily Dyson Harris and I reside in District one. You have quite a bit of information that I have given to you, and I want to say thank you very much. Cast member Elian Gonzalez, Jenny Pierce and Stacey Monaco for, you know, bringing forth this agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My very God daughter Amaya are being taken to school one day in November 2009. Said, Grandma, it's not right. The Miss Frances can't get out of out like us. What a profound statement and compassion for Sister Chow, which was, unbeknownst to me, the beginning of a horrific, horrific, horrific nightmare.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I endured a non-operational elevator until January 29th, 2010. My goodness. 73 days. City Council members to have a power to flash a red light and stop such access, which may be considered a form of involuntary imprisonment. Similar incidents have been well documented on various news broadcasts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Every day is a process day and people have a right to lift it to the fullest. Days calm cannot be relent. Now please review attachment A as a notice of inspection by inspection, notice was served to the property where I lived at on the 16th of December 2009, and on the 23rd of December 29, I called the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'property manager. I mean, Ribo have her and he said, Francis, you're calling to tell me that you're out. So I'm going to tell you I'm not out. I've been in for my Thanksgiving, my birthday, Christmas and New Year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, I'm going to who knows when I'm going to get out of here. So he was livid. His time. I served them and can scare the heebie jeebies out of him. Well, you know, they still did absolutely nothing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'How sad that serious numerous violations would not adhere to until January 29, 2010. And then I have here about allowing a temporary interrupts a service, but I'm forced it has not clarified the number of days. What the problem is, is the federal regulations, which you have and I wrote a federal bill.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's kind of Washington. It came back. Congressman Albert has sent back to Washington. It has to be clarified the number of days when a temporary interruption services in town has defined no family status to the entity composed of fine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's been moved forward. But I just want to commend you for going ahead and putting this in place, because it's absolutely essential after two months of not having medical care, my condition just was just beyond words. Just and I had to find someone my friend found to carry me out of the building.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I pay the thousand, sometimes $80, for grass assistance to get out of the building twice. Thank you, Councilmember DeAngelis, for asking me in 2010 words you can. And I told you basically that I was trapped up in the building.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'When people are in a decimation of lives, surely a non-operational hour puts them on a detour. Okay. And so back in March after that and then I have, I believe, most frustration it's created and met expectations and this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr.. So thank you very much. And I have a poem that I have for you, our, our friend.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have, we have and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm going to give back to you as part of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have it already. The site. Thank you. Thank you so much. Make speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mayor, city council members and the community. My name is Karen Reified and I happen to live in one of those multi-story buildings. I actually live on the 17th floor. And during the power outage, the elevators became a major issue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to suggest a couple of things. There's the evacuation and it's actually done by the fire department. And you've never lived till you've seen the fire department have to evacuate a woman from 17 floors and carry her down the stairwell who is over 300.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We do have sleds in our buildings that they get removed and they don't get replaced. So that's another issue. Seven days is really too long for seniors to go without elevators. When the power outage hit, we discovered that we had an emergency generator, but it was not connected to operate the elevators.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we were without elevators for four days. I went personally up and down the stairs, 17 flights and I'm a mobile person. There are immobile people on my floor. Each floor has about 12 units. We had five people that had to sleep in the lobby on benches, hard benches, because they didn't weren't able to climb up the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'stairs to their third and second floor apartments. Elevators are absolutely critical for senior citizens. We also have issues not necessarily just for the repairs, but when they go down on the weekends. The moment this lasts Memorial Day weekend.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We only had one elevator working in a building with 800 people. That's very critical. The elevators were very slow to get in and out. If you have a critical situation, fire department has to climb up those stairs and evacuate those people.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this is great that this is coming forward. I would suggest some some more changes and maybe some special provisions for on the weekends, because there's not always someone on call to respond if there's an elevator down. And oftentimes, it's just that they need resetting.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the seniors are without elevators for the whole weekend. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Male mayor, council members and others in the auditorium. My name is Ben Rockwell. I would like to let you know, I have experienced over the last 35 years that I've been using a wheelchair. Many times when elevators have gone out.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sometimes I've gone out while I've been on the elevator waiting to get down. And has taken hours at times to get out of that stopped elevator. It's very frightening indeed. Of course I do get to sit down and relax, which is better than most of you would.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But even so, it's not very comfortable to be sitting there waiting for hours for the elevator. It would be nice if we had elevators that worked every time and were always doing what they're supposed to do. But we all know that isn't a good way to live in anticipation that that's going to always happen.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But we do need to plan for the future and plan to get these things taken care of properly. I would like to have each person consider what it would be like to have to be stuck in their apartment for more than 24 hours or 48 hours at one time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's not very much fun. But I will say we can get by with a little planning, planning for food as for any disaster, because elevators are a disaster, especially for those of us that do not have the ability to climb stairs.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I would like to suggest that we continue to work on having quicker aims rather than seven days to make it a three or four day stay. Because seven days is a long time to get stuck, especially when it's a day before you are planning on going out to buy some milk.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Rockwell. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and council members. My name is Dolores Cindy, and I'm the executive director at Disabled Resources Center in Long Beach. And I am here to support the Reliable Elevators ordinance. And it looks like all of you are, to which you're a great council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You really are. Since I have worked at DRC for the past 25 years, I know how important it is for people with disabilities to have the same freedom to live their lives independently like the rest of us do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have had the experience of knowing firsthand how tragic it is for someone to be trapped in their living space like Frances was for 73 days. During the time Francis was confined, she often called me and she would share with me what she was going through all season.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, Cindy Soto worked at DRC for many years, and I remember all too well when Cindy would not be able to come into work because her elevator wasn't working. It's just inexcusable for persons with disabilities or for anyone else to have to be trapped in their homes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You often hear the excuse. Oh, well, the elevator is old, and it's hard to get parts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, you need to install a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'New elevator, then.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's the bottom line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There should be no hardship for owners of these buildings. If they can afford to keep their elevators working, then they should own the building. They need to sell it to somebody else. You know, Francis is here tonight, and we need to put a face on people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'More than than just a broken elevator. It's a lifeline for people like this. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next week, Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening, Mayor. City Council members. My name is Richard Hernandez and I'm a system change advocate at.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Disabled Research Center.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are located.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'At 2758 Spring Street, Suite 100 and Long Beach, 90806. We represent the disabled community and seniors. And I'm also a commissioner for the Citizens Advisory Commission on Disabilities, Cape Cod.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm here in support of Lena.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Gonzalez's elevator ordinance. It is, which is long overdue. People with disabilities want to be independent. We want to go wherever. We want to go whenever we want to go. And when the elevator is down and we're stuck at home, we can't go nowhere.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We need to be dependent and we want to be dependent. We don't want to dependent friends or family members to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Buy groceries or buy food.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Or pick up our medicines. Not only is this not right, but it is dangerous because in an emergency, there's nowhere to go. I've heard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Stories of people.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Being stuck in elevators for weeks and months at a time. It's unacceptable. Broken elevators should be fixed within a reasonable amount of time. So I'm asking for you to do to do the right thing and support this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hello. Honorable Mayor and City Council people. My name is Mary Sandy. Have a seat. Okay. My name is Mary Sunday House and I work with Cal State Long Beach, and I'm also the executive director for Professional Abilities Association of America.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm also a first district member resident, I should say. I want to thank Councilwoman Nina Gonzalez, her staff, Corey and Corey Allen and Jennifer Miyama for working so hard with Heather from the city of Long Beach. And also Francis.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know that that I'm a firm believer in things happen for a reason. And I think that the reason this happened to Francis because she has a very strong voice and she was going to do something about it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm very proud of you, Francis, for bringing this forward and actually, you know, thinking of other people, because it's not only about Francis, it's about everybody else. So one of the things that's very important is that, you know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As a disabled person, we strive to be very independent. And when we get when we get stuck in a situation that prohibits us to be independent, we struggle and we struggle to ask for help because we're so used to being so independent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so, you know, even though this is a big step, I'm really happy. And that Long Beach City Council is actually looking at this ordinance and saying, you know, that something needs to be done because it really does need to be done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I see a community where, you know, we think of the people with disabilities, seniors as a before thought and not an afterthought. And and I really like that. And we need to continue doing that. I actually experienced both with you know, I experienced Frances being stuck in the elevator wondering when is she going to join us'",
        "'speaker_10': '? You know, I've also experienced Cindy Soto being stuck in her in her elevator. My worry was like, you know, as a professional, how is she going to get to work, you know, okay, maybe one or two days. But if you tell your boss, oh, again this week, my elevator still not broke.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I'm going to have to miss another week. But that week turns into like a month. And it's just not no, it's just, you know, something has to be done and it is very inhumane. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Long Beach City Council for considering this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Sun House. Appreciate it. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and councilman and also councilwoman. Thank you for being here and thank you for your service. I am here to tell you that I am 110% in support of the ordinance to regulate the elevator repairs related to the equipment failure.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We are asking for the required repairs to be completed within seven days in the commercial buildings, also in the residential buildings as well that serve seniors, elders, people with disabilities and any other health conditions that makes it difficult to navigate the stairwells.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Tenants pay rent for these services, so they should be able to request a reduction in rent if the elevators are not working. And that is just fair play for tenants and landlords. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. This is the last speaker. Mr. Goodhue, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's Larry Goodman. Obviously, it's a it's a much needed. Ordinates. I mean, it's just so obvious. It really doesn't need to be discussed. But one suggestion I would make is also reduce the time and the turnaround time. One day, one day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that the company is not in a position to do that yet another company, period. And it doesn't make any difference to the age of the group. Whether they're seniors, whether they're kids in high school. College. If they're stuck, they're stuck and they need to get out of there in one day period.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was a good point pointing out the job opportunities with the elevator repairs. But they should understand there's some ups and downs to those type of jobs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, Mr. Goodyear, that was pretty funny. That was good about that. That concludes public comment. Let me go back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Vice Mayor Richardson, thank you. I just want to chime in and obviously say good work to the council members who raise this issue. But what really prompted me to chime in and speak was sort of how enlightened I am now, just hearing the public comment, all of you come in here sharing the stories, helping us better understand'",
        "'speaker_12': 'there were a lot of people who were impacted. But you had a very specific impact, and it really impacts your ability to participate in society. Those are the kind of issues that we should take on to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So so I feel really good about supporting this item. So I want to thank everyone associated with this. And I hope we can we can do something here to, you know, improve, you know, your quality of life. So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just wanted to wrap up saying thank you again for for speaking. I appreciate each and every one of you and Mr. City attorney, if we can. I know things sometimes delay, but if we can get this back in 120 days, if not sooner.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And also listening to speakers, if we are able to look deeper into that seven day window and tightening that up a bit, that would be most appreciated. And thank you guys again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. We're going to do some of our public comment now before our to take a vote. So please, members, cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. I'm going to have our first three speakers of groupies by topic. There's a few folks here for the same topics Patrick Kelly, Duane Wilson and Dan Daniel. I think it says winner. I'm sorry for misspelled there at the.'"

    "Recommendations to Support Smaller Music Venues and Review Current Regulations.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment. We're now moving on to the rest of the agenda. We're going to hear items 27 and 28 next, which are the two entertainment items. And so, madam, we I'm assuming and as we do get ready for that, we have a deal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do have a report out of closed session.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Our work over the last several months shows the power of the community groups engaging with their electeds around issues that matter most, where you can see a difference. In April, we hosted a terrific event with the Music Council and the Arts Council to discuss ways that the city could better support our music community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With over a hundred people there was nicely packed in. One thing became really clear. We had a strong and vibrant music community and no shortage of talent here in Long Beach. What's also clear is that the music and arts and culture are huge local economic drivers for our city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In 2015, the Otis study found that a total economic output for the L.A. region creative industries is $176.9 billion and generated over $7.7 billion in tax revenue for L.A. County. That's huge. In Seattle and Austin, the music industry directly creates over 11,000 jobs and 18,000 jobs generated 90,000,040 million and local tax revenue, respectively.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Here in Long Beach, we have a higher portion of people employed within the arts and entertainment design and media industry, directly accounting for over 9000 jobs. That's from a Beacon report that the city commissioned last year. As a city, we're struggling to fully capitalize on the talent opportunity because of outdated or restrictive regulations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In December, we took an important step forward with the percent for the arts program. And now we must make sure that our tax dollars are paired with regulations that support and not hinder our arts community. We are in the process of many forward facing challenges here in Long Beach, whether it's our draft economic blueprint for our for'",
        "'speaker_9': 'our city or our 2040 general plan. These changes reflect a city that is setting a vision for its future. And tonight's proposals are no different. And we haven't updated our definition of entertainment activities since 1996. One of the defining factors in many large cities across the U.S. and the world is that they have a vibrant arts community'",
        "'speaker_9': '. This isn't by accident. It's by design, by policies and frameworks that cities have laid out over time, which don't just tolerate the arts but cultivate them, welcome them, and embrace them in an internationally recognized report. Making Music Making a Music City.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They laid out five essential components to a successful music city. These are the presence of arts and musicians, which we know we have a thriving music scene, which we also have available space and places for music which we're trying to grow in a receptive and engaged audience, which I've definitely seen a record labels and other music related'",
        "'speaker_9': 'businesses, which we know that, you know, places like or organizations like Front Porch Records started in the second District, which I'm proud of. Of the seven strategies listed, number one is creating music friendly and musician friendly policies. Tonight, we're taking an important step forward as a city to support the arts in all its forms, acknowledge music both'",
        "'speaker_9': 'as a cultural and economic driver, and ensure economic growth in years to come. So we've got two items on the agenda, and I'm just going to briefly go over the first one and then we can have our colleagues have a discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember We're going to do because I know we have the same folks want to speak for both is I mean, have you read both items and that way we understand what both items are and with the public comment for both items, I like it and we go from there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sounds good, mayor. Okay. The first item is about having our regulations, Max, to match the reality of a wide range of music venues we have here in Long Beach. The problem right now is that the code which defines entertainment activity as whenever amplified or more than two people, uses a lowest common denominator approach to regulating and puts'",
        "'speaker_9': 'almost all venues in the exact same category. As a council letter says, this means that a jazz trio in a small coffee shop is subject to the same rules and regulations as a rock club that serves alcohol to 100 people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The average cost of an entertainment permit is 1700 dollars, and this number is higher in denser areas like our downtown. The other option is where to get occasional event permits. Each time may be less expensive on a one time basis, but ends up treating casual live music as a special one time event.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as we also know, many places that would fall into this category actually don't end up pulling their permits at all. And so it makes it difficult for us to say as a city how much music and entertainment we actually have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we again, we want to make this easier. In both cases, the existing regulations discourage business owners from hosting live music, provide less options for musicians, and ultimately lead to less music and potential economic activity in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our goal is for the staff to study the issue from all angles. Review current definition of an entertainment activity. Consider factors such as decibel levels, crowd size, and determining whether a business has to apply for the cost of the application.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For example, some cities exempt business. Says that don't serve alcohol or have an admission charge from having to even apply for the entertainment permit. We're not here to say that there should be no oversight, but that the oversight and the process should match the impact they have, not hold them to the same standards as a result will'",
        "'speaker_9': 'increase our number and consistency of live music throughout the city. So that's number 27. Okay. I am going to very quickly try to get to number two. It's much shorter, don't worry. So our second item is let me just skip over that part.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The second item is making sure that we have music at cafes and street performing. That is directly connected to economic activity by attracting people to areas where there are businesses and enhancing the character of everyday experience. So this is the idea around busking and live entertainment on our sidewalks and in our downtown corridors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you've ever visited a first Fridays in Bixby Knowles or newly installed fourth Fridays on Retro Row, you'll see the way the street performing can bring street to life. Something as simple as waiting for the for the walk light can turn into a memorable experience.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we want to make sure that street performing is not commonly looked down upon and that it's done in areas where we can make sure that we're doing some great placement making, often due to confusion both within the code and inconsistent enforcement and misunderstandings between businesses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These opportunities are shined away from, for example, Title 14 says a permit is required to perform in the public right away, but no permit exist. So our goal is to have the city sit down with business associations, performers and definitely residents to understand where we're at, how to encourage this, and how to balance the type of entertainment'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that will bring life to our corridors. So I respectfully ask for our council support on both of these items. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Councilman Gonzalez. And then we'll go to public comment for both the items.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sure. Thank you. I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this forward. I think we are exactly everything that she mentioned. We are absolutely a music city, an arts and culture city. But certainly with music, I don't think we give us give ourselves enough credit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think these two items will kind of make things start and initiate that credit that we deserve as a city that has really enabled so much talent to get even more popular. As I was saying outside, we can even name a multitude of of artists that have made it big just from this city alone.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And in addition to that, the locally, organically grown artists that are here that will make it big one day. I would hope that we make it a lot easier. It's been a struggle for musicians to just play at a coffee shop.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have North Pine residents, business owners, in fact, who want to start a Twilight walk again every Thursday. And all they want to do is have a jazz band out front of their cafe. And to do that is so cumbersome.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To do that is such a hassle. And so I really thank you for digging into these details to make sure that we get it right. And I also see down the down the line that we look at this a little bit more comprehensively as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's a lot more that we can do here in terms of music. And I look forward to all of our ideas and making sure that we make it happen here in Long Beach. So thanks again and I look forward to public comment as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. If there's no objection, we've got a public comment. Okay. So why don't we go in here for the public on these two items? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council members. My name is George McCaleb. I'm a resident at Lena Gonzalez's first district. I'm a musician. And I also host a weekly open mic here in Long Beach. I am continually amazed at not only the level of talent here, but the variety.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The diversity that I see is astounding. I don't know why it should surprise me. Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Has a history.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of great music in a variety.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of areas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Charles Mingus. With Birdland. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band came of Long Beach folk music. The Carpenters. Popular music. Sublime Rock Music. Snoop Dogg rap. You name it. We've done it here and we've done it well. And I'm proud to be part of that community and that legend.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When I was looking for a place to host my open mic, I found a venue that would have been excellent. Management was on board. The owners were interested in doing it. Till they ask the question, What kind of permit do we need?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I did some homework. I found out it would cost over 1500 dollars, actually over 1550 just to apply and have the inspections done. That's nonrefundable money. That would get them in front of the council where they could ask you for a permit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you said, yes, that's another thousand dollars per year. This to host a one night a week open mike and a pizza parlor. They were willing to make the room available as a service to the community. They were not willing, and very understandably so, to spend over $2,600 just to get the first act in their.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Long Beach has a great tradition of music. It has great potential for music. Like I said that the talent here is phenomenal. Variety is amazing. You can't find another city this size that has that kind of. Variety and that level of talent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm very happy to be here. I just wish the city would make it easier for small venues to get a license to do this and do it within the law instead of doing it kind of on the quiet, like a lot of things are happening right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I thank Councilwoman Pierce for doing this. I want to acknowledge my councilwoman. I want to acknowledge the other people that have signed on with this. And for those of you who haven't. I hope I've been able to educate you a little as to what it's going to take to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. My name is Tim Donovan. I've been playing on the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Street in Long Beach Music for over 25 years. Is this thing. Can you hear me? Okay? Just talk. Okay. Over 25 years. All right? I'm a one man band called Testament. Some of you may see me for different events.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've worked with several.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City organizations over that time, over the 25 years, as well as small businesses, members of the art community who have hired me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For street events. I've done private parties. I played the farmer's market every Sunday.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For a long.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Time, these farmers market sometimes downtown.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been involved with the Armature Business Association, Public Corporation for the Arts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'East Village Arts District, which we know is Business Improvement Association. Long Beach City Nursing School has hired me. Fourth Street Rose Park Organization has hired me. I also have been instructor at kids camps and poets. Word is as well as afterschool.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Programs for Drumline. I played on the street in many locations. I try to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Always choose them carefully and ask those local businesses, like in the case of Shoreline Village, there's a bunch of kiosks and I talked to them and I said, you know, they get to know me and they say.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure, come on. You know? And then it would be every Saturday was okay, somehow that's been ruined. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why it doesn't they won't allow me to go on down there anymore, but I feel that some of these groups are misrepresenting me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's been advertising on the Internet and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maps to inform people of the places and locations that I've researched for years and in basically been my whole life is just plain.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Going and doing. My one man band and playing all the items for my one man band are found objects from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long Beach, from the city, from going around on my bike and finding things. And that's how it started, you know, and it's been 25 years into it and now I see it in the paper and I get a couple of days ago that this is going on and no one's asked me and no one's bothered me at'",
        "'speaker_6': 'all. So I feel pretty left out and I feel like I'm being misrepresented in this case. I like some of the ideas that I've seen, you know, finally this evening seeing what's going on here. But I feel it's kind of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vague, a lot of it. And I want to be involved with with any major decisions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Going on with this, you know, and I'll be I'll be, I hope, speaking and meeting with the council members soon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I thank you for your time. Thank you. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next week.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Karen Retherford, a resident of the First District. I'm going to talk about this from a couple of perspectives. I ran the Cultural Alliance of Long Beach for three years on Pine Avenue. When we started. Kalb There was nothing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We had all four spaces in the bungalow buildings. I thought artists that we were just initially going to be a gallery, but the requests from the community were for music, music, music. So we were one of those unpermitted places that treated the concern of the artists and musicians basically just want to play for an audience.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we let musicians play whether they had an audience of three, and our largest puts about 150 people. We hosted bands and that just wanted to play who then went on national tours. We hosted some really large groups.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We hosted Grammy Award winning artists in our gallery. That was very, very secret. I can attest that the cost of permits we did a jazz event over at the Mad House. The cost of permits makes it really difficult for musicians to perform in our professional capacity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I also want to mention I love the fact that these ordinance suits are coming forward. Music is a great activator and the arts are a huge economic engine for our community. In my work with the Boys and Girls Clubs, I could see the differences that access to music and music instruction made in the lives of at risk'",
        "'speaker_10': 'kids. The kids need more places to stay, to play, to present themselves to the community. One of the groups that we. The only time we got a police car was from a neighbor across the street because we hosted a birthday party for a group of teens who brought in local teen musicians.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And my first encounter with social media and the power of the message. And we had over 300 kids, you know, they were very well-behaved. But the neighbor, because I was trying to do crowd control and limit the attendance, the police made me cram everybody into the building.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So because the neighbors were complaining, but we still didn't have any incidents. I can't stress to you how important it is that we create more opportunities for artists and musicians and performers to have places that are affordable and accessible and available, available equitably.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I also want us to look at when we bring concerts and events to our community. How many local artists do we feature as opening acts? Where do we give our artists opportunities to perform? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Give an honor to Jesus. This is a this could be good, but then it could be a bad, too. Because if you're talking about all these regulations on sound and everything, I don't like it. I went to the Long Beach Jazz Festival over a decade ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'James Brown is on the stage. He's just getting down. 10:00 comes Long Beach. Police say turn it down. How are you going to turn James Brown down? That's that's number one. I mean that was bad you had mostly white crowd Newcastle the police out themselves you know and that was back when I was a Democrat you know'",
        "'speaker_8': '. But check this out. Hey, so you know, all that regulation now this is cool for the music, but not the regulations. I mean, you got to let the music grow, you know, all that, you know. So that's what I think about that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm too much on that. So good for the music. But regulations easy up you know you can't have a a rock band be the same as Mingus would eat I mean jazz is different. You got to let a rock rock be rock.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, jazz isn't how are you going to have them regulated same levels. You can't do that. So, you know that's all I've got to say on that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I am mayor and council. My name's Liana Cobb, and I'm the owner of Hard Knock Life Entertainment. I'm a music manager, actually. Entertainment Management industry. I also became a member of the Grammys in 2016. I'm very involved in the entertainment industry firsthand by experience.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Knowledge is power, so you can definitely research a lot of information. But for me, I need it. I need to partner that out with experience. I'm also in charge of entertainment for Jacqui, a boxing gym here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We are having an event July 15. So my first question to the owner was, is there going to be live music all day? He said, Yes. I said, okay, we need a permit. At first he was like, Wait, wait.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I said, We need a permit. Now the app, which is an occasional entertainment permit at this time, is only $100. Like I explained to my venue, if you can't afford $200 for that permit, there's much bigger issues than entertainment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now with the OSP, you can only have two events per month, up to 24 events per year, which is understandable because you are in a non zoned entertainment community. If me myself, if I purchased a home in a community not by clubs, I want to be able to have some peace and quiet while your business is turning'",
        "'speaker_10': 'up. And then you go home and wherever you live and I have to sit up when insomnia or insomnia, try to recover from your business just turned up and it's not fair. So we want to make sure that we are looking at all aspects.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do have some questions with regards to some of the things that are being proposed with regards to the venues. Are the venues or where are the different licenses such as city licenses and BMI and Mascot? I know what the difference is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Someone in someone that's in the music community would say there's a difference. Yeah, I know that. But people who are not business inclined may not know that. So we need to make sure that they understand that if the city says you don't need a license or a permit for this, then being might ask as soon something.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They don't like what the city just said. We have to make sure that we understand all the information that's being provided. Has special events been engaged with regards to the consideration of changing the permits? Does the venues understand why this submission has so many restrictions in the community?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What measures will be put in place so that a coffeehouse doesn't turn into a full time music venue? Our chance of being made to these other locations and see how they're doing with these venues be allowed to serve alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sometimes we will say business is technical. Oh, you're being too technical. Business is technical and everything is all fun and games. Until something happens. You can have ten great unpermitted events are permanent events, but you have that one permanent event.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Then it becomes a problem. So let's just make sure that we have all of the information. Again, I think I'm a resident and second District. I work in sixth District. We have such a great support from both district, especially from Councilman Eddie Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So again, let's just make sure that we have all the information. The entertaining license does not come into play unless you want to do more than two events per month. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Honorable Mayor. Council Members. City Manager. My name is Mark Judah and I'm the one who is managing the second Saturday artworks in downtown Long Beach for 20 years now. And as you know, half of what we do during the art works is music, and we do have a permit for that purpose, although the permit that we hold'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is only for so-called background music to only 50 decibels per performer. And it's it's just about equal to two people talking on the sidewalk, you know, and a little louder. So it's impractical on top of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because we are a public event on the public street. We facing other challenges. And I wanted to address a couple of those before I go to the event that we host for every month, for 20 years, is free to the public for the public from any charges or any submission fees, and it's accessible to everyone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this event was is hosted since 1997. What we are struggling with is, is the surprising fact that the organizers, me and the non-for-profit that organizes the event, pays a repetitive fee to the city of Long Beach, to the special event office every six months for the same exact permit for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is, as I mentioned, it is free to the public. So we kind of struggle with the fact that we actually have to pay for it as a non-for-profit organization providing service to the city residents. And also on top of that, the special event officer requires us after 20 years to sign signatures from residents and business owners'",
        "'speaker_6': 'every month in a number of 80% to approve the street closure, which, you know, in fact, is practically a solid part of the East Village reality. And we would feel that it shouldn't be even necessary. So what we believe is necessary at this point, as it made it three points we would like ask you to help us'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with grandfathering in this public event into the East Village structure and calendar and waive all the survey signatures, also waive all the city fees. And most of all, we would like to ask you to help us to dedicate a budget that would come from 1% for the arts for Long Beach to our non-for-profit organizations so we can'",
        "'speaker_6': 'continue running the second Saturday artwalk for the future generations. So with that, my might ask, what should we do at this point? What will be the next step? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. Mayor and council members. Thank you for for allowing us to speak tonight. I am standing with a member of the fifth District. I live in the fifth District. I also am the Minister of Music at Grace First Presbyterian Church, also in the fifth District.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I am also a member of the Long Beach Music Council, which is the organization that helped bring this along with the Arts Council. To your attention, today's matter of fact, I brought my sign to prove it. So that's my son.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are very excited about the chance to bring these things to you. And I wanted you to just.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Address.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This from a slightly different angle as my role as Minister of Music. We have music camps through the summer. Starting next week. We have a school of rock camp for high school children. And one of the things that I know that one of the reasons I joined the Music Council was because I wanted to do things to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'support musicians and to support the music culture in the city and to grow it. And these proposals are designed specifically to do that, to give musicians a chance to make a living and to stay here and want to help make Long Beach grow.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And what that does one of the things that does that I've seen with the kids that I work with, they get a chance to work with people like Coon, who's going to be closing our concert, our camp next.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Week, and Sarah Green of Spare Parts for Broken Hearts, both of whom are being in one was in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Music taste good festival last year and one is going to be in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It this year. And to have these local musicians be able to grow up and do these amazing things, and then to be able to watch that spill over into the education of the kids they get to touch with.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The things you're considering to do today will not just help these particular things. These are helping to grow Long Beach as a as a music city and to make music an economic driver in the city. And that will have spillover effect in many, many ways, particularly for our kids and our youth.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I thank you for taking this on today. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. I close at speakers list. So. So, Mr. Cogen and then Mr. Goodhew. I'm sure he'll be the last speaker. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Much. My name is John Serge. I'm in the fifth district as well as Stan. And I am a musician. I have a band, John, Serge and the Haymakers playing at the Shoreline Summer Fest, August 18th. Got to promote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we're here. I'm with the Long Beach Music Council, which I think just a quick introduction to what we do. We we're here to. We're a volunteer group. We have absolutely zero budget. You see our signs up. There are people who become together in work, been working.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The group has been working for about four years now. And I think it's really cool. It's a it's kind of the power of of a volunteer group of people getting together with passion for something that they think can make change in our great city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I think a common bond is we all love the city and we've come together. And frankly, you know, a lot of the folks here, you've been open to us bringing our issues to you. And we thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, it's really been kind of an open or an eye opening experience. Like, wow, maybe we could get some change, maybe we could make some difference. And I feel like this is a first step. We feel like and the idea is, hey, Austin, New Orleans, Seattle, we can be as good as them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's nothing stopping us except. We don't have the energy, the momentum, the passion. And we want this to happen because we can build a lot of build big buildings, we can build all this other stuff. But people go to Austin for music.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, their their slogan is a trip to Austin is not complete without live music. So that's what we're doing. We're kind of setting up. This is a first step. Come on. Small venues, two people in a corner playing acoustic guitar and singing harmony.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. Street performers on a beautiful day. Colors of sound and in colorful clothing and people out and not asking permission from business owners. Really, we want to be respectful, but we also have to realize the musicians have their place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is just a start and we hope to take this as far as making Long Beach a music city. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Hi there. Hi. Members of the council. Mayor. My name is Connor Locke. I'm a resident now of the third district, formerly of the fourth, and before that the third. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a community that valued music education, teaching kids to follow their dreams and their passions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I got to travel to San Diego, to Florida, to Walt Disney World, and to Hawaii as a member of a jazz band, and then the vice president of that jazz band and as the member of the marching band.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I learned to love music. Seeing my friends from that time in those bands try to make it in music in areas like Long Beach, like Northridge, in parts of Los Angeles and areas as far away as Berkley as Austin and Seattle, some previously mentioned cities.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They're struggling really hard to get venue space, to afford to play.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To find places to do what they were told they'd be able to do by following their passions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The opportunity. I know it's only a study at this point, but the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Opportunity to figure out ways that we can encourage our young people.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think I'm the youngest person to talk tonight on this one. To follow their dreams, too. To bring art into our lives and to make that the soul of the community is something that you don't often get to do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I don't want to use too much of your time, but please vote in favor of this. Please support young people following those passions and bringing our city a happier environment, whether it's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tourism or not, although I'm sure it would be, is not the most important issue here. It's that we teach these kids and we invest in them as students from elementary school through high school to college here in Long Beach, and especially with the college promise that they're going to be able to make a living and do what'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they love. And we should really stand up to that and keep it going as they transition into adulthood. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. Suarez, the director of the arts council for long beach. Thank you. Mayor garcia, vice mayor richard, sitting council members for hearing this item tonight. Thank you to Councilmember Pierce. You know, it's been a great pleasure to work with your office and also with the Long Beach Music Council on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm so glad to be here tonight. We're glad that we are helping to amplify the voice of the arts here in Long Beach. As you know, we support our artists and musicians, and there are many a handful tonight that actually have received neighborhood micro grants to do their performances.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the musicians and performers of Long Beach are a vibrant sector of our arts. Ecology and music can transcend language and barriers and in many ways brings people together. So beyond the cultural benefits, music here in Long Beach also has an economic impact.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As you know, customers come to businesses to listen to music. Tourists come to the city to listen to music, making Long Beach a place where people want to live, work and play. Recently, the Arts Council participated in a national study.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Arts and Economic Prosperity Index. And through that, our national study and the data that we've collected of our grantees throughout the years, we learned that the average person spends $31 on top of the admissions to a music or performance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that means that dollars are coming into our city and that our musicians and performers are part of that. We also are known as a Long Beach Unified School District. We are known to be an amazing music education district.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so in making this item, bringing this city forward, we're actually helping not only build audience, but also build spaces, places and venues and business owners interested in employing our young musicians as they grow into their art form.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have made many strides in support of the arts and here tonight I think the music community and the performers are going to be part of those strides. Adapting our policies. Some that are as old as 20 years is a way to ensure the future growth of the arts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you for bringing this to council tonight. And we encourage you to make Long Beach a destination for arts and culture and especially music. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Members of the council staff. My name is Tasha Hunter, and I'm here on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Behalf of the Uptown Business Improvement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'District. And I want to say thank you to Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pierce for bringing this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Study or this item to the agenda for allowing. Ah, the music. Music is an important part of, of our lives. And, and as far as the Uptown Business Improvement District, we do support this in our local venues as well as our street vendors.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's an economic driver. And with along with Long Beach, solidifying its reputation as a destination place, our street performances will create that positive impact that we love to see. I love walking somewhere. And like someone said ahead of me, when you hear those music performances, when you are allowed to have bands perform inside, it will not only'",
        "'speaker_10': 'draw people from within the city, it'll draw people from outside of our city continuing to make Long Beach a destination place. And we already know when they come to hear the music, they're going to want that slice of pizza, that ice cream cone, that jacket, when it gets chilly, which are all parts of it, could be an'",
        "'speaker_10': 'economic driver. And the more people on the streets means economic vibrancy. This will give us the proper ammunition, especially as we in Uptown Business Improvement District bring in additional businesses and help support the current businesses that are there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's something special about other cities that we've seen and we know of Santa monica of Venice Beach that recognize street performances and music in our coffee shops and venues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As public.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Amenities, as long as it takes place in a reasonable place and at reasonable times. So there's still many questions that we have and we look forward to working with the city and COBA, the Music Council and residents to take a peek at this study and just answer a lot of the questions that we still have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And also, I must say, as the current president of the Arts Council, Long Beach, and a Long Beach resident, I personally know that Long Beach is home to so many musicians. And it would be a very nice gesture to be able to allow musicians not only to go outside of the city to practice their art, but to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'allow their neighbors and community to appreciate what it is that they have in their own city. So thank you. And we look forward to helping in supporting any way we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Greetings, honorable mayor and Honorable City Council. First of all, my name is ah, Netta Maslow and I am the ambassador for Make Music Long Beach. First of all, I'd like to thank the Arts Council, Long Beach. The Long Beach Symphony.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'City of Long Beach. Honorable Councilwoman Janine Pierson. Her office. Long Beach Public Library and downtown. Long Beach Alliance. Because tomorrow, June 21st is the first day of summer solstice and Long Beach is going to be lit. And what I mean by that is that the city is going to be lit up orange in honor of summer solstice'",
        "'speaker_10': '. And the first time that Lone Beach is being part of this global event, which includes 800 cities across the United States and 120 countries globally. What I found in organizing this event is so many people, organizations within our community wanted to participate, even nurseries, youth organizations, but they were concerned about permits.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so many people declined because of that. And we've got to change that. There are so many opportunities and so many creative people here within our city. It's just amazing and it's also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So very beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So tomorrow what I'd like for you to do is come out and support over in the fourth District, also on First Street, on fourth Street. There's going to be it's going to be lit up orange at the arts building, the arts theater.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The fountains here in Long Beach are going to be lit up, orange, Queensbridge and another other installations. And you can check that out and make music wellbeing. And next year, we'd like to have this event just be something phenomenal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This was put together rather quickly as I was brought in at the last minute, and I was thinking, Oh, okay, yeah, we'll do this. We'll have it ready for 2018. They said, No, we want it this June 21st.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the outpouring of love in this city and just the outpouring of just participation just warmed my heart and just elevated me. And to remove these constrictions, these financial constrictions on these smaller businesses that can benefit from this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It'll just be phenomenal and even better next year. So I thank you. And anyone who wants to participate, you can contact us at Make Music, L.B. and you can find us on Facebook and on Twitter as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Now, I had Mr. Good. Who can you come down? I had to close the speakers list, sir, but I will let you stay in line. It's okay. But these are the last three speakers, Mr. Cogen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council, Craig coaching with the downtown Long Beach Alliance. Our organization has been producing events in our downtown for many, many years. We would never consider having an event without entertainment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not only.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because of the value that it brings to the artists and to the community, but also to the economic benefit that it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Derives from creating events with.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'With the entertainment. Our downtown has a dining and entertainment district ordinance. We've had that for many, many years. And so it's I would be very interested in seeing how this materializes. This conversation continues to materialize relative to what we already have in place.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm very supportive of the idea of having a 120 day period to study both of these agenda items. It certainly gives us the council offices, the Council of Business Association and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All the neighborhoods that are impacted with improvement districts, as well as those neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Outside the improvement districts.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To have that discussion, to have that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Open public display.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of transparency and understanding really what we're getting ourselves into.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is something that I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Think is long overdue to look at these policies and reevaluate these.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Policies. Thank you, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pierce and those other council members that signed on to these two agenda items to be able to bring this forward. And we look forward to this ongoing conversation. Thanks very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'First of all, thanks for having me. I was actually handling some other stuff for another music event that's going to be happening. I just moved here in January. I lived in Austin, Texas, for 12 years. I could really see when I moved here, I I'm constantly, you know, in any city I go to, I've traveled all over'",
        "'speaker_12': 'the country and United States have been very fortunate and almost been to all 50 states. And every place I go, I have my ear to the ground looking for what sound is going to lead me. You know, in here it's been quite interesting trying to find that because it you know, we do have Alex's bar.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We do have we do have places that have live music. But it's it's just so separated that it it's it's saddening to see because I know that this is going to be symbiotic for the for the city and for the musician.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Obviously, there's a lot of loopholes and a lot of things that you have to make type before. And but it really looks like this is this is something that we've a lot of people have been waiting much longer than I have.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But as soon as I got here, I realized that, you know, it's kind of it definitely is an issue. You know, there's there's that's the culture of the city is when you hear the sounds and I know that's it sounds redundant because I know everyone's been saying that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But, you know, with anything you have, there's a song that that kind of puts you in that same place. And I hope the song that that we will all be singing this time next year will be out there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And if somebody moves to the city from outside, they can they can actually find their way faster and enjoy the the culture that Long Beach has. The thing that I the reason one of the reasons why I moved from Austin to Long Beach in particular is because of the diversity, you know, in in Texas, there's there's not'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that diversity. And I'm really interested to see what what does Long Beach Street sound like? Thank you for your time. And I hope this all works out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speaker is Mr. Goodhue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You do the address on file? I'm a strong supporter of music, as you'll recall. I had suggested that we play opera in this chamber, soothing opera from 430 to 5 until the beginning of the meeting. But it was our mayor that said, no, that couldn't be done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Period. The key to having music in a neighborhood is to make sure that is appropriately located, period. There are many areas in our city where such as Second Street and on Broadway are. Music is very problematic in many times.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that is key to what's going to any growth of music is to make sure you have the right place. And the right neighborhood. And when I say right neighborhood, it doesn't make any difference what neighbor or who you're in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Probably 95% of the people do not want to hear when they go in their house at 10:00 at night. Music pounding for two, three, 4 hours. Coming floating from a block away or even two blocks away. So having it appropriately located.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is absolutely key to that period. Thank you. And I would urge the mayor again to consider soothing opera music from 430 when the chamber opens to 5:00. It will it can have a very soothing effect on those people that are sometimes rather riled up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Riled up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. Which are back to the council councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I appreciate the feedback from all of the groups here. This is an important item. I especially want to take the time to think. Councilmember Pearce for being really inclusive in her item. I know oftentimes we get an item and we ask colleagues to sign on and one of the things that I thought was really important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'about this item was being really collaborative and I thought that she was really collaborative. And not only did she make necessary or recommended edits, but multiple edits. And I think that that was reflective of a really collaborative approach that she has taken all the way through on this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's the only way an item like this will ever be successful. With that, I want to say that I hear from the community that there are current abilities to have some permits that are limited to a month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think a lot of the discussion also is about the seasonality of music. And I think that in discussing the potentials, perhaps certain businesses don't want music during certain months, but they want to aggregate all of their permits every Friday in the summer or different types of aggregation like that that make it really neat.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for that, I want to continue to support it and explore this opportunity to have a study come back and see what we really can do to make it a worthwhile opportunity. I can't tell you how many times when my husband and I are choosing where to go to dinner, we might say, Oh, doesn't so-and-so play on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wednesday nights at restaurant A or B? Do we want to go by this place because it has like a nice background? Or maybe we want to go hear what these people who are in from out of town because it's more than just great, great food, but it's also great music.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think those are really great components of some of my favorite places like Forbidden City and others that have music and while you eat and or drink coffee or any of those things. So I'm really excited about this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank everyone who's done the work. I think it's important that we continue to maintain input not only from the music community but from the business community and from the residents, because all three need to work in harmony for any of this to be successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to just you know, I've collected some thoughts through this whole conversation. So I want to start with thanking Councilwoman Pierce for reaching out and asking me to be a part of this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think music is is sometimes coolest words, most unexpected. It's been really core to what, you know, a lot of the changes we've seen take place in North Palm Beach. You know, when I first started working up here, it wasn't a place where you think of as a center for music.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But nowhere else in the city have been able to get on the stage with Talib Kweli or the Far Side or D.W. Three, even Ozomatli this Saturday. You know, I've seen more elected officials come to North Lambie's for music than any other purpose.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And, you know, when Beach Streets kicked off in North Lawn Beach or activate uptown, people didn't come North Lambie's for mobility improvements. They came because the music was the attraction. And and, you know, as retail continues to struggle with, you know, increasing demand of the on demand economy, you know, people are looking for more of an experience'",
        "'speaker_12': '. And so we don't need to look at maybe the corridors and things have been successful in the past. We have to sometimes take a leap of faith and think about what could what experiences could be successful in the future.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And music and art is core to that experience. We have to be more flexible in terms of how we how we regulate and allow music. Well, a couple other thoughts. You know, I noticed I was taking a like an executive leadership class at USC.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It was. And they were looking at different models for civic engagement. And there was an example, a case study on a program called There's a Festival for that in Decatur, Georgia. And it focused on one area, one particular corridor that, you know, had some violence issues.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the way that the city and that district sort of resolved it was those violence prevention issues was by relaxing not just the entertainment permit, but also, you know, some of the special event permits. And essentially the rule was you come to this one corridor, you can you know, if you come, this one corridor will relax our'",
        "'speaker_12': 'festival permit. As long as you don't conflict dates with anyone else. Well, limit our will limit are no permit fees. You can only use local vendors, only use local artists. This area had two restaurants in a period of four years that had over 20 restaurants in that same little corridor, despite relaxing and creating a different culture.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I also think we have to think about right now, California is paying attention to this and establishing new cultural arts districts, a process by, you know, to be designated for certain areas to be designated as cultural arts districts.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think this is a huge opportunity for us to think about how our policies align with that process and how we can help facilitate that some. Because if you notice a lot of the corridors that have violence issues or a history of violence, a lot of times are the same corridors that have a rich cultural history and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'diverse, diverse make up in those neighborhoods. Maybe if we look at some of, you know, some of the strengths in the area and then communicate with the people through music and art and culture and reflect and see it as a way to be a way to highlight that corridor.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then perhaps we can also mitigate some of the violence, violence, you know, use as a violence prevention tool. Another thing is, I think we should be I think we should maintain our flexibility and keep the the tools to protect the quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Last thing I want to do is take away a tool that our planners, our code enforcement officers have to crack down on a, you know, a dove bar. That's really been a nuisance. And so I do want to make sure that we do have the flexibility when appropriate to go in and say, look, you know, you don't'",
        "'speaker_12': 'get to play because you're not playing nice and you're doing these illegal activities here. And I think we should also be I don't think every neighborhood in town is going to be the same. So we should maintain some level of flexibility and tight things, the corridor to certain corridors.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I hope that we can work together with our community, with our business districts and with city council offices to determine where we think less restriction would be more palatable than other other areas. So that's something I think is really important.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So those are some of the thoughts that I have here. And, you know, I'm going to go ahead and give a plug. Saturday sixth Annual Uptown Jazz Festival, Ozomatli DWI three partnered with my buddy Roberto Durango and a number of others to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I hope you join us there. And Thursday, we have Pop Up Town, a pop up music event at the Michelle Obama Library. Nobody thinks about library and music at the same time, but I hope to see you all there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thanks. And you have my support, Jeanine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Grace.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I, too, want to echo my support for this item. I everything that the speaker said in terms of the. Benefits of music. I agree with my family and I all enjoy live music very much where frequent concert attendance and we often choose places to eat based on whether they have live music or not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I am a big supporter of that. I do agree with Mr. Goodhew. So his his batting a lot of successes tonight and Vice Mayor Richardson, in regards to us having the flexibility and hopefully this report including the flexibility for us to be able to, you know, tailor any sort of ordinances or changes to particular neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I can tell you in neighborhoods that have a business corridor that has close proximity to residences, this type of ordinance are relaxing the standards for music and talking about music. Music levels is a subject of major sensitivity. We often have our city crews out there with a noise meter trying to determine what the level of the noise'",
        "'speaker_11': 'reading is from a particular restaurant or bar and so on. In Belmont SHAW For example, a noise is a is a major quality of life issue for the residents, as one of our speakers talked about. And it's certainly something that is above all else a major priority for me, respecting the quality of life of the residents there'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and ensuring that they have the opportunity to sleep and have their kids sleep is really important. You know, this year we had a fantastic pride celebration, but that night at the Pride Festival, something went wrong with the music and we could hear it in East Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In my own home, the windows were rattling. My kids were not able to sleep. It was a school day the next day and we were the next door decomposed, were going off the charts in regards to people not being able to sleep because of the music.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Obviously that's an unusual situation because you rarely would you be hearing music in East Long Beach from downtown. But the point to be made is that if you're not partaking in the music and you're just trying to live your own life and do whatever it is you're doing, hearing music may be a nuisance to you, even though'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the music may be beautiful and maybe, maybe the music is enjoyable to you. If you're not participating in the music, it may not be the time and place for it. So we want to just make sure that the music doesn't travel to the residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I can tell you there's a lot of businesses in Belmont Shore who would love to have an entertainment permit to play amplified music. But that's just that's something that we're like I said, we're very sensitive to and very carefully monitor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this item, it's a fantastic item. It was on the supplemental agenda. So we have not had the opportunity to do the outreach with our community. So we're grateful that this is a report and allows for us to have the time or have the staff go out and do the necessary outreach and determine what's possible and feasible'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to Mr. Good. He was point again in the city of Sacramento. They actually pipe classical music through the downtown. I don't know if anyone's walked there recently. And there's data that shows they have a reduction in crimes in the downtown area, a reduction in transient activity because not everybody wants to listen to classical music all the time'",
        "'speaker_11': '. So it may not be a place where they perch. I probably would.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Choose to perch there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because of that, but some are not. And so there definitely is a lot of data that suggests behavior is associated with music and the type of music. The other thing is that I'm hoping that the report also considers if there are any legal issues, this is more to the busking item, whether there are any legal issues regarding'",
        "'speaker_11': 'regulating content or regulating that type of content or anything like that. I know that's a discussion we've had in the past. So if we've got statutes that prohibit some content but not others, I just don't know what legal issues, if any.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There may not be any, but I would hope that the report would also include that because those definitely raise some flags for me. Other than that, I think Councilmember Pearce and the folks who were asked by her to sign on to the item should be commended.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think it's a fantastic item and I think from what I'm hearing, everyone on the council really enjoys live music and we want to do whatever we can to encourage its growth in our city. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you so much. I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this item forward and allowing me to to sign on. I know she has been researching and our staff's been working on this for many, many months. So it's good to see it finally come forward, obviously, to the Music Council and Arts Council for providing your support'",

And I think this is what the new economy we have to take creative approaches to to to to creating jobs and economic opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These both of these items will will create income for artists throughout our city, which I think is very, very important. It was mentioned regarding quality of life. Just yesterday, I live around the corner from Schiller Park and it was live music emanating from the park as the Be Safe Long Beach program kicked off.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And to me, that was a quality of life moment because it was good to hear live music coming from the park. It was great to hear the laughter of many kids and families enjoying our public park as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The obviously it's been mentioned there'll be many economic potential economic benefits from from these items. It's an opportunity to build community and hence our overall experience, particularly on our commercial and business corridors. I tell you, every first Fridays, Atlantic Avenue comes to life in a way that that is unique to to the Bixby Knolls experience.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'They are household names in throughout the city of Long Beach. They would not have that opportunity to be known throughout the city, would not be able to share their art if we weren't for us being amendable and open to to them sharing that particularly through our with our business improvement district in Bixby Knolls and the businesses that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that invite them to perform. I think I'm going to obviously support this. I'm not too convinced that Long Beach isn't the best city in the country when it comes to music and the talent. I'm convinced that we are certainly headed toward that path with these agenda items.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, again, I want to thank you, Councilmember Pearce, for for bringing these items forward. I want to thank the many artists who who came out to speak in support. And, you know, let's do it. And I do want to say to one point that in terms of how we go about doing this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One size does not fit all. It does not have to be a blanket approach. We have to understand that we have we are a city of very unique neighborhoods and very different experiences throughout this city. And I think we need to appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, classical music can be playing on one corner, rock and roll the next. Reggae music, hip hop music. We we we have every genre represented here in this city. And when I look out in a crowd here tonight, we have every genre represented as well.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Donohue, I mean, good. You I tell you, guy, you are on to something. But when I hear my young brother, he is talking about James Brown and no, how can you have any kind of anger in your heart when you listen to James Brown and a little opera at the same time?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is no harm in any of that. So I think we are on the right track. Long Beach is music. You talk about it. So all you look at all your great ideas that came out of you. So I think everyone should have a chance to be able to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we talk about the Bears ordinance that we have to have. We need music, you guys in really special in order to get it. We're going to have to really do those corners so people can get a chance to be able to express their opportunities.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I brought it. We bring some chamber music to welcome people to the council meetings at around 5:00.

        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. I'm going to Kasra Pearce is going to close with a couple final comments. I want to make some comments as well and a couple requests of staff. Want to thank Councilman Pearce. I think this is really a great discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that her office has been working also with my office and particularly Mark Taylor, who has a little bit of a music nut to talk about some of these issues with the Music Council. And so I want to thank the Music Council for their really hard work on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This would have happened without you guys. You guys have led the way on this issue. So a couple of points to reinforce which I think are really, really important. One is the issue of flexibility. I want to reiterate what Councilwoman Price said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guarantee you that the you know, the the reaction from Belmont Shore and the businesses community there would be dramatically different than an appropriately different than perhaps in the downtown or in other places. And so there is obviously it's not really a one size fits all approach, I think, with the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm just I'm just hopeful that that that message is heard. I also want when we when we're reviewing our new rules, I just am hopeful that we also take a look at some of the best kind of live music locations in the country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we had someone from Austin here. We obviously should be looking at what Austin has for their some of their rules in their entertainment zone and other cities like Austin. And I will say my personal opinion and I've shared this with Councilman Pierce is I think that the downtown entertainment district needs to be looked at extensively.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think personally that it's overly restrictive in the downtown. I also believe that the boundaries are currently of the of the downtown entertainment district are no longer necessarily should be the boundaries considering that the downtown has grown. And so those boundaries were drawn and written at a time where you had nothing going on above third street in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the in the downtown. And so the downtown now is stretched all across the first District. And so I think the boundaries have to be looked at within the downtown entertainment district. I think we often have more restrictive rules in the downtown entertainment district than we do in other places in the downtown, which to me is crazy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm really hopeful that you guys take a good look. Obviously, we need to work with the Dolby and the board there and neighborhood groups, but that is something that for me my main request is out of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a strong and hard look at the D, at the downtown entertainment district, the zone, the rules and being much less restrictive than we currently are, in my personal opinion. And the last thing is, please also look at rules regarding these kind of pop up music parklets that are happening on the backs of trucks and busking'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is happening. So I mean, I'm at the Socialists and I might be having like a burger and a beer and this truck pulls up and is just playing music. And I love that. And we're and I, you know, it pains me when sometimes our folks are going by and shut these guys down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's to me, it's it's adds to the community. And so I'm not sure if the rules, whether it's amplification on the sidewalk and inside of venue and then these pop up music. Parklets, I just want to add that we're including that in the discussion, so I don't know if that counts as a street music or not'",
        "'speaker_0': '. It's busking, I know, but can we please look at that as well? So very supportive. I'm looking forward to getting this done. And and and again, I think the message is the flexibility to really in hopefully some areas, particularly the downtown is dramatically reduce restrictions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, you stole all my talking points. I'm kidding. I want a just one last time. Thank everybody. And also, it was mentioned a little bit about who we be working with. So I wanted to clarify for folks that we have made sure that we'll have financial management and special events working collaboratively together through the process as we'",
        "'speaker_9': 'engage other stakeholders in this and made sure that we did this in much partnership with them. And the items changed a lot over the last couple of months by us working with city staff. So I want to thank Julia for doing that and also thank my staff for working closely with Mark Taylor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One other thing I wanted to say is, is the clarity on the flexibility. What we have on the item is that we want to see if it's legal to allow bids to make decisions on what those regulations are, how they would apply the policies that we have in place that way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In Belmont Shores, you might not have busking, but on Fourth Street where we love busking, you would be able to have that. And I had those guys serenade me many a times, and so I just wanted to clarify that for folks watching at home.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I also wanted to just ask if we could also include looking at other cities and if they've done anything to lower permit cost for possibly like youth programs like the vice mayor was mentioning. As we I know there are a lot of groups in the city that do open mics for youth, particularly those that are.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In difficult situations. And so if there's anything that we can do to encourage more youth programing around music and entertainment, I would like to see that included in the report. So thank you, guys, everybody. And again, this is just the beginning.'",

The criminal penalties we believe, were already in place. And so this ordinance at this time does not impose additional or further criminal penalties.'",

There's the opportunity to get involved with the operation of of utilities at the site, which will hopefully discourage illegal operators. In short, I think that the statute covers all the different aspects that were raised and all the areas of concern.'",

It's a great, solid piece of legislation that provides clear guidelines and explicit consequences for those who are choosing to operate illegally within the city.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Christopher Ingraham from The Washington Post recently wrote an article detailing some pretty good information that's been gleaned from police, from national police statistics showing that these so-called kinetic or militaristic raids using the law, using the police departments in general raises the specter for violent incidents to occur during where essentially now completely civil and administrative procedures.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's both a waste here locally. The use of police during these administrative inspections essentially is a waste of resources and largely unnecessary, unless there's a specified and articulated reason to believe that the operator, the illegal operators there would be armed and dangerous.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I say that being entirely conscientious, that the Code Enforcement Department suffered a murder believe within the last decade of an inspector by mistaken about that. I'm sorry, but I believe I remember that happening. So obviously there is a concern for inspectors out in the field and we and that is to be respected and that has to be'",
        "'speaker_5': 'upheld. But again, without a specified reason for believing that this could be the case, most of these illegal operators I mean, I'm sure all of the people here would be shocked to believe this actually don't know that they're operating legally.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Many of them have just decided it will decide to just start putting plants on the ground without ever consulting an attorney or reading the municipal code. Hopefully, this particular instance provides them the notice that's necessary so we don't have that happening again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it is. Two other quick comments, too. SB 94 has been recently just was signed, I think today by the governor. So unfortunately, Charlie, the wonderful regulatory packages of the AMA and the NCR say that your office has been working with for the last couple of months, there have now been more or less erased and they're being'",
        "'speaker_5': 'combined into one particular bill, which means that we might have an entirely new comment period to three starting soon with all new regulations from the state level. In terms of in addition to this, the only this particular ordinance, I would recommend highly that the code that the code enforcement or whoever has the jurisdiction over this particular issue'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Those streets go between a high of 60, 65 to 40, and those receive an overlay or just a recoding of the top layer of the pavement, which typically costs roughly around $10 a square foot. And the red layer in the bottom shown there are poor or failed streets.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'for the lowest possible price. The next few slides are going to show conditions are typical. Streets that fall within the condition ranges we just talked about on this slide shows poor streets those are poor and failed are in the PCI range of 0 to 40 and those are streets that have an excessive amount of failures throughout the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'pavements. They have uneven surfaces and we receive a lot of complaints about those streets. Next categories fair. Those are the streets with between 40 and 65. These streets still have a lot of failures, but not not extensively as much as the completely filled streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These streets can be overlaid. So the repair costs, it's effective to catch these before they fall into the failed category for repair. Streets there in this slide showed streets are in the good condition. These streets can receive preventative maintenance like slurry seal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we were able to do every street, hill, street in the city in the first part of measure, the majority being this year, which really got a lot of the streets and kept them in this range for a very cost effective price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And finally, excellent streets. These are the top of the range, the 80 to 100 that were shown at the top of that previous slide. These streets don't require any maintenance initially. Like it's likely that the first three seal will be roughly around seven years after they're built.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So street inventory. There's a lot of streets within the city of Long Beach and people don't realize how extensive the Street network is. The value of the street now is over $1 billion, and the total length is just short of 800 miles, 786 miles.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's enough to build one street from here all the way to the city of San Francisco and back. That's a lot of streets. So conditions. The condition of the PCI within the city in 2015 was an average of 60 and that number has gone up to 62 in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there's been an increase or an improvement in the city. Arterial streets have increased from 63 to 68 and residential streets have gone from 56 to 59. That increase in residential streets is largely due to the slurry seal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Streets that happen for measuring the amount of poor streets in the city also increased and that increase has a large impact on how much funding is needed to maintain and repair our entire network.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before you move on to go back real quick. So just just to for clarification, so can I add, this is this is a number. No, go back to the slide, please. Watch this on the screen. This one. No, the one in front of me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I don't mind looking at myself, but.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The one with the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's okay. I'll just look behind me. The one that was up on the screen before. That's okay. Yeah. Can we get to the PowerPoint? There we go. Thank you. So I just want to stop here for a sec, because I know this is this is the main number that we look at when we're looking and grading'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our streets and kind of what will be greater between street and other streets. Overall, just regardless of the fact that with the very poor streets, that slight 2% overall, the pimp from 215 and two in 2017 has gone up, correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr.. Mr.. WEST Well, I'm sorry. Mr.. BECK Yes, it has. Okay. So so our streets are in better shape today in 2017 than they were in 2015, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. And and to two points is a large increase in just two years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. And and so one, I want us to say a few things. One is many cities right now there are going down. And so you're seeing that in a lot of places. And I talked to mayors that are, you know, obviously obsess about these these scores.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to just thank staff before we move on that the fact that we increase that pump up over those points just in the last two years, I think is a huge accomplishment for the city, is we're going in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The change is the right direction. And did we were we able I know to ask you this question, were we able to capture all the year one measure, eight streets in the 2017 number or. I don't believe we've captured all of them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We were able to get all of the slurry seal streets that were done this year within the. We did. We did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But not so weak. So all all year one. I don't think that's true. Are you sure that's true? So just for clarification, Mayor, as you know, we're actively involved in slurry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sealing streets and all of the streets that are that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Under Measure eight, we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will accomplish roughly.'",
        "'speaker_5': '95% of those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Streets in what we're calling year one, which is fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_5': '17. The remaining 5% will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be picked up in year two, which is fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_5': '18. And so I think your question really.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Relates to when we look at this PCI number and we're value evaluating our street conditions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When we went through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And did that analysis, were all the slurry seal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Streets done? And the answer is they were not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So while we did have a majority of them as part of that evaluation, we did not we were not able to capture all.'",
        "'speaker_5': '95%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of the streets that will be done in fiscal year 17. A-Train. Okay. That's what I thought. And why I think that's, you know, additional good news is because while we've had the the improvement in our streets that didn't even capture the complete measure a year one street network that we're working on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that number will hopefully even increase once that full complement of the measure, eight year one streets are actually completed. And so again, this is great news for the city and happy to see that the PCI went up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know moving even one or two points is very difficult, so thank you for coming. I would just add to that, Mayor, if I can, that we we do fully expect with the continued investment that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council has supported moving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Forward, that we will see.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Street average improve again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When we do this in 2019, 2020.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I love it. I'll keep you on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So comparison with some surrounding streets and other agencies is shown on this slide. The state of California average pieces 65 Orange County, L.A. County and San Diego are above that. And we fall just just right under that average.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So progress there's been this slide shows the summary of what's happened since the last PCI as our last payment management has been done two years ago. In summary, the the pieces have increased $70 million, over $70 million have been invested in our city streets, in large part due to measure that $70 million investment this year included 35'",
        "'speaker_6': 'miles of roadway slurry sealed with measure eight, with another five miles of that remaining portion. That will be done next year. So to address all the needed improvements, the PMP recommended $420 million in investments in 2015. That's a $42 million investment over ten years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would take the average PCI from its current level to a PCI of 80. The current PMP. That same need increased to a total of 510 million. That increase in costs is due to streets that have fallen from fair the fare category down to our poor condition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That cost is called the backlog of the PMP and is shown at the bottom of this slide has having gone up from two or 5 million to 309 million.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So before Sean goes on, I just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Want to make a point on this. I think it's important to articulate why we are seeing some of our very poor streets increasing. That was a conscious.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That we made as staff in council that we wanted to stop any further decay of streets that were in the fair and good range. And so we focused our investment in those categories. So I think the expectation is that we would see some of this growth down here in our worst streets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But at the same time, we were able to improve our PCI overall and make that investment to save those streets and extend the life of those streets where we could.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For less investment, if you will. If you remember the earlier slide, it's much cheaper to do an overlay than it is to do a full reconstruction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there are investment opportunities for investment in the future. There's three new funding opportunities that are coming up that everybody's talking about. Measure em is half cent sales tax increase. County of Los Angeles. SB one is a statewide gas tax increase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And of course, the measure that we've been talking about for City of Long Beach that's gone into effect. So Alice, just a few slides on Alice this year. The city's measure funded the first alley management plan. Many of the transportation funding sources that we have are not eligible to be spent on ALS.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's the real reason why we haven't had one to this point. The measure does provide $5 million total identified for Alice. So condition of the. There's over there's 220 miles of alleys throughout the city. 80% of them are concrete, which are in generally in general in good condition.'",
        "'speaker_6': '15% of those alleys are asphalt and those alleys are not quite in as good a condition as the concrete. With an average PCI of 36, there are 5% of the Alice 11 miles that are gravel. Those have a PCI of zero and they have a replacement cost or a construction cost of $5 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Add all those up. We have a total in needs for Alice. Just a shade under $100 million. So next steps, detailed funding options will be coming forward with the budget in July. This will also include an update to infrastructure needs and technology needs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That concludes the presentation. Available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if I may go to Councilman Mungo here in just a second. Actually, Councilman Austin is the maker of the motion. Is there a second on there? Okay, Councilman Mango, one thing I want to add for the council beginning presentation, it's my understanding that in the next few months you're going to come back to council with more'",
        "'speaker_0': 'specifics about the sources of funds and then and how much we expect will actually be put into the budgets for additional street repair on top of what we've discussed with Measure. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Mr. Mayor, that's correct. Tonight, you're really seeing two of our components, which is streets and alleys. There's a lot of other infrastructure, too. So we want to be able to come back to you with more of an assessment of the other infrastructure needs, which includes sidewalks, includes facilities, includes technology, and then match that up with the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'revenue sources that are coming in and and make some recommendations on where some of those investments could best be best be made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm going to turn this over to Councilman Austin making the motion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank our public works director and Mr. Crumby for their their very, very thorough report. I know we entered into the payment management plan process a few years ago, and we've been anxious to get these results back.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so this is, you know, very, very informative and sobering, so to speak. But I will say that that, you know, I think I'm encouraged a lot more today than I was three years ago because, you know, at this point, we have at least four different funding sources to work from.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Whereas three years ago we only had one funding source and that was Measure R for arterial streets. Today we have, as a result of voters here in Long Beach, measure a L.A. County, measure M, as well as the most recently passed legislation, SB one.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think items that we all or measures that we all support it. Here are the Council recognizing the important need to invest in our streets and infrastructure here in the city of Long Beach. So I'm encouraged where we're going and it's good to see that the pavement management plan is actually moving up in a positive direction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, what I don't see here on the street conditions is a category four alleys. I know they're not streets, but the alleys is a the number there is very low and very concerning for me as well. And I know we get weekly calls from residents regarding the poor conditions of alleys in my district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, we are at a loss for options oftentimes to to provide them in terms of funding to fix those alleys. And so I'm really looking forward to this this matter coming back in the future with and hopefully staff can have some some recommendations and plans to to address those needs as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I guess a couple of quick questions. Regarding where we're going. And perhaps you discussed it and that was part of the slides. I may have missed it, but where do we expect our PMP to be in the next five years based on the funding that we have, the options that we have today and the current plans that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we are moving forward with?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Customer Austin As I mentioned earlier, we believe with the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Money that's available in the new transportation funding that was recently passed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By by not only voters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In Long Beach, but of L.A. County and the gas tax that was increased at the state that we see that there's an.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Opportunity to actually increase the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amount of investment we're.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Making in our infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as a result, we would expect that the PCI.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Would would increase rapidly. So while we do have good news this evening and are able to point to a 2% increase overall excuse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me, a two point increase overall.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That there that will likely be greater if we stay the course in the coming years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I like the likely grader, but it would make us and I think our residents feel a lot better if there was some sort of forecast. And that actually brings me to my next question, because it took us quite a while to to get and it was a significant investment to even get the pavement management plan done'",
        "'speaker_8': '. What is the the methodology utilized to to actually project or so increases that we've had over the last couple of years? Since 2015. How do we measure that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we hire an independent third party expert that does pavement management plans for cities and organizations across the country. They have a scoring methodology that's been adopted throughout the nation in which they drive automated vehicles over every single street and alley throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's three criteria that go into developing the score. One is a structural criteria where they drop 11,000 on the street and measure the structural integrity of the street. There's also a lighter. It's like a radar that measures the surface friction or the surface of the street and all the cracks and potholes and all of those sorts of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'things. And all that data is used to come up with the the high score that you see on the screen that helps to develop the repair strategies and costs that go into forecasting for the report.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So actually getting that data requires some some investment in itself, right? Absolutely. So what does it cost to do a PMP for the city of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this PMP update, it was about 200 to $250000.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so we do a PMP in 2015 and in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the the updates, once the system is up and running, the updates are significantly cheaper than the original.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you very much. And like I said, I look forward to having this discussion ongoing. Obviously, this is this is one that is very, very important to to our residents. It's encouraging. I'm really encouraged, particularly as to where our arterial streets are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It looks like we're going to be in in a good status fairly soon. And obviously, residential investment, we can't do enough of it. And that's it for now. Keep up the great work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Mango, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I want to thank the public works staff and I want to thank them so genuinely, because it's been a tough two years in the fifth District. When I was elected, we had. $40.6 million of residential street need, and the next closest district was the seventh with 23 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the only reason the seventh District was even close is because they have so many concrete streets that have a need and a cost that's higher than an asphalt street. And to that, I'd like to say that that is if you were to say that each part of the city is a ninth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had double of a night. They had point 22% versus the point 11%. And so one of the challenges that I see is that all of these numbers are so big and overwhelming that we don't really get our arms around it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would love to see a council that makes a commitment not only to the 45 million now 510 I'm sorry, 51 million a year that we're going to need to get to the 510 in ten years. But I want to work towards being a council that says I'm replacing my roof today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It costs me $20,000 to replace my roof. My roof is good for 20 years, and therefore we should be putting aside $1,000 a year so that when it's time to buy a new roof, we have the $20,000 in the bank that we can loan out to ourselves and borrow from ourselves throughout that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But so that we have the money in the bank to be fiscally prudent and pay for the streets that our residents are entitled to. So I appreciate both of you for coming to so many community meetings and explaining the challenges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I recognize that we really need to be patient because the amount of work we're asking of public works at this time is an insurmountable amount of work and the number of streets that we're planning for and the complexity of our streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that the second PMI study was needed because we had some challenges with the first one, and I think that that revision was important to make sure that everything was in that network. But I also think that in the future this street inventory needs to be talked about in things that are more digestible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So when we talk about 609 miles of roadway, I think we in the city of Long Beach need to determine what we believe an average street is. So let's say the 3400 block of shade way or an average street in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we need to take that 609 miles and say that is 6000 streets or it's 12,000 streets or whatever it is. So people recognize how many streets are in that process. So when we as a council say we're going to slurry, seal 92 streets or pave 600 streets or whatever we're going to do, it's equitable and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'understandable to people because Miles don't mean anything to a resident. And so what I hope we'll have when it comes back with the budget is how many streets or street equivalents we have in the city and then how many of our streets are in each category, and then how we put that out over time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How long will it be before we start being able to do the real work on the very poor streets and the poor streets, and then to the good work of the council that we've done on the alleys, how many street equivalents do we have in alleys and what does that look like?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because an average alley might not be the same. And so we're able to start saying, okay, with this money million, we can do this many equivalent streets in those categories because the numbers are there, the $10 per square, the 11, the four, the two, all of those are usable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if you don't know what an average street looks like and you're not able to save shade, why is 1.5 of an average street or point seven of an average street? That discussion with the people who elected us to be here, the taxpayers that deserve good streets is just not equitable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm looking forward to an aggressive budget where we plan out our infrastructure for enough time where an average resident can say, My street is getting paved in and you should know that year it might not be 2018, it might not be 2021, but we should have a date and time where we've made a commitment to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'residents of when their street is going to be paved. And then I really appreciate the additional considerations that public works have made. I know that some of our streets are less safe to walk on than others because our residents don't have sidewalks in certain parts of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I appreciate that in those parts of the town where we're talking about the mobility of our community, walking in the edge way of our streets, that those streets are considered of a little bit differently than the rest of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I appreciate the hard work to date and I say we have a lot more work to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Andrews. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. I really especially most of the things that you just spoke about the same I'm I'm hearing the same thing in my district, especially with the alleys and everyone just what they want to know, win. And like I said, I can't give them a definite date on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'm asking, you know, I what works? Do we have some dates on some of those when we talk about our alleys? Because most of alleys in certain district, they're just they're just all dirt. And if I could be able to tell some of my constituents, you know, this is a date that we will be working with'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Usually I would feel very comfortable and I know they would be too. I just can't say, Well, it's on the list. And that's what I'd like to kind of hear from you guys. When can we give these people some definite days that possibly, you know, we and I know you're going to go to the city and find'",
        "'speaker_3': 'out some of the. I'm assuming that you're going to find out some of the worst allies or do we do that and let you know and then you would take it from there? That's kind of where I am because I'm getting a lot of feedback from my constituents about their allies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Andrews I think what I would would respond.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With is we are at the beginning of the budget process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we fully plan on bringing forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Information that will allow this Council to make decisions and allow this Council to be more informed about where those investments will be. And so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where we sit here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the edge of July and typically council goes through a lot of budget deliberations in July, August and September.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And my feeling is by the end of that budget timeline, you'll have a good feel for when and what type of investment will be making in both streets and alleys.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I appreciate that because I think since the measure has been passed, they think this will just start tomorrow. It's not going to be like that. So I'm sure now that our constituents have a better understanding that there it is on the list and it will be taken care of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you very much for give me that information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, I want to I also think everybody for their work and I guess echo what everybody else is saying, that alleyways are the things that we get the most concerns about. And definitely in my district where we have so many apartments where people use alleyways.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think one of the things that we've noticed is it's not just the cement, but it's just drainage overall. So I was wondering, is there are there other measures going to be taken besides going flat with it?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or there are areas where we know we need to look at our drainage system before we go in and repave our alleyways. It's trying to understand the how.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Big it is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because, remember, Piers, maybe I can respond to that by saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That when we would go in, let's take an unpaved alley as an example. So we know we have a number of dirt alleys across the city, pretty much in every council district, at least one or two. If we were going to go in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Part of that project would include not only paving, but flattening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any rough edges, doing the appropriate grading so the slopes are appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then when we put an alley in, you would typically put in a concrete what's called a concrete ribbon. So that drain down the middle of an alley would be concrete. And then the side dry, miles, would be asphalt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would be the type of investment that we would recommend to this council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As opposed to, say, doing an all concrete alley, which would be much more expensive. So would be a way for us to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Stretch our dollars and get those alleys improved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Thank you for that. And then just wanted to say that, you know, I know that as we move forward, measuring dollars, fixing our alleyways and addressing some of the illegal dumping and potholes is something that I know we're looking at overall.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But really just thinking about our alleyways is not holistic. It's a whole other system that operates very differently from our streets and our sidewalks and everything from lighting to where our trash bins are. And if there's designated areas that we can make sure we're trying to manage that going forward, I think the whole city can really benefit'",
        "'speaker_9': 'from that. So thank you guys so much for the work. I look forward to the follow up report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Thank you both for your great work in this. I think this is definitely what we need to accomplish here, and I think this is a great plan. I will also reiterate the back alleys, of course, and will more courts in ways many people have identified them not as allies, but as courts in ways as they are'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And so a lot of our historic districts will identify them that way. And looking at that, I know that we've already talked about dirt alleys. I know that that is definitely a major priority. I've even talked to Craig directly about that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I had a question, though, as to some low hanging fruit that I think has been done before that we could possibly work on. And that would be like our urban greening grant, for instance. Lorraine Away, that was completely repaved and we added benches, we added some landscaping.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I believe that was a state grant that we received for that particular location. Did that state grant include the repaving or was it just the landscaping? I don't know if we have an answer to that, but.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that that was a that had a lot of features within that that grant and it did include the resurfacing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. It did. I would say that many of our historic districts, particularly Willmore and Craftsman Village in their courts and ways and alleys, will be I know that they would be yearning for that type of project and another urban greening grant, maybe that is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's also opportunities through Southern California Association of Governments in that respect. So I think aside from what we're doing and just repaving them, perhaps there's an additional avenue we can take that would not really take away from this pot of money, but perhaps a state funding.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then the difference between the slurry and full cement. I know that some of our courts and ways may just need a slurry coat. So I think that was identified. But is that going to be in the the report coming back as well?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So part of the presentation that will come back would be a recommendation and how to invest the dollars that that we have available and what those strategies would look like.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I just wanted to make sure that. Great. Well, thank you very much for the plan. This looks great. I look forward to more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Rinker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. This is a obviously a very important discussion for us up here because obviously when we run for reelection, we will run for election period. Streets and alleys and sidewalks are the most important and most common questions we get asked.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, when are you going to fix my street? What are you going to do about my alley? That's I mean, that's a common question every time and every time that we get that that question as elected officials, we look back at staff and we say, well, well know, what's the answer there, staff?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we have a timeframe? Do we have a timeline when these alleys, streets and sidewalks are going to be addressed? And usually it's like, I don't know, there's no plan. So I'm glad that this is coming forward for us to review especially.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've seen that we had some great progress with our with our residential streets. But I'm also interested in what's going on with our alley management plan. I'm glad to see that you have one here and that that's going to be addressed, because if there's any one topic that always bends my ear and I'm always being chastised for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is that you're not thik you're my alley. And for some folks, especially those in apartment buildings, the alley is very important to them. It's their only access to their to their homes, to their garage, or to their to put put in their trash cans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There has been some discussion about from residents who said, well, if I can't use my alley because it's so bad, can I put my trash cans on the front? And the answer inevitably is know that that's where the trash trucks go.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They go through the alley to pick up the trash cans and however in disrepair it may be. So I'm looking forward to to see what the alley management plan looks like. I would especially like to know if and when we could get those grading points so that we can look at the priorities for some of those alleys'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Because, again, I say that those alleys are a lot of a lot of residents depend on them for to get into their garages or to get into their homes. And I think it's very important that alleys become a priority in this management plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also, we there's a mention here about the 11, 11 miles of dirt and gravel alleys, and that will cost about $5 million, according to the study that you have right here preliminarily anyway. And I would like to see those dirt and gravel alleys paved right away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But then again, you know, a lot of them are concrete, which is more expensive, which is probably probably if there is a plan out there, probably take a little more years and then we would like to have them take.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's something that we need to to plan on. And I think that if there's anything that we can do as elected officials and we're we're approached by our residents about what are you going to do about my alley, that we can at least give them a plan, that we can at least give them a date or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we can give them a cycle of where we're at with our allies. And I think that that's going to go a long ways in helping our residents not only have access to their homes and their garages, but also making making our streets a lot better and our alleys a lot safer as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No question. Just come.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. Really open up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. I'll turn some of that commentary into questions. The first one. Well, first of all, let me let me second what Councilmember Grainger said about the alleys. I think a lot of folks who haven't experienced this would be shocked that we still have dirt alleys in Long Beach, but we do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You haven't separated out the dirt from the gravel? I don't think it's one category for public works at this point. To the point that Councilwoman Mongeau made, I think everyone understands that the idea of doing the slurry sale on the good streets, that you're going to get more mileage out of that because there I guess we could'",
        "'speaker_12': 'call that the low hanging fruit. What is the plan moving forward to to continue that completely before we get to the poor streets?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Suber, not again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When we come back with the second phase of this presentation, the staff will be providing options to counsel in our recommendation. I think the good news to share.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that we will hear shortly through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The measure of funding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be be completely up to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Date.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With all of our slurry program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's not to say that we won't have a street or two out there that may fall into a slurry category. But again, at the time when we did our last payment management plan, we identified all those streets that were eligible for slurry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are prioritizing measure $8 to fund those streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as I mentioned earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will get through roughly 95% of that list by the end of this fiscal year and the rest of them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Early in fiscal year 18.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. So I think your point is we're going to get to the end of it either way, whether that's our plan or not. Okay. The other question I have is. What I guess is asking you to do. Can we have dates when these things are going to be done?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think that might be doable on the very good quality streets. Now, when you get into poor quality, I think our gap analysis has more of a function that is what are if you want to define gap analysis, be my guess, but it's what you envision is going to happen versus actual performance.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And when you get into a bad street or a bad alley, it can eat up dollars and time and lots of other things. So it'd be very tough for you guys to come up with dates when this street or this Al is going to be done.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Would you like to comment on that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure, Councilman. I think generally our goal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is to provide a three year snapshot that we believe that that with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some certainty, we can achieve a certain number of streets each year over the next three years with some.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Confidence about the funding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Levels. And that's likely what we would be able to bring to this council for for as staff's recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, again, there's.'",
        "'speaker_5': '$300 million of needs in very poor streets over three years. We're not going to be able.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To address all $300 million of that need. So there is going to have to be some prioritization that is made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What we will be bringing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Forward is the pavement management plan. Again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a robust plan. There's a lot of information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And data that is part of the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we can look at the available dollars and that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pavement management system, if you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will. The program itself will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Help prioritize what street it recommends.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, the system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would recommend be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Prioritized first. So as your staff, we take that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Information into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Along with those priorities that we've heard from, from individual.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we've that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Into our recommendations that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We bring forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. So it sounds like you're confident that you can make a pretty good guesstimate as to where we're going and we won't deviate too far from that. The last question is, I don't want to go beyond the scope of what we're discussing here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So involving other departments are coming up with efficiencies, with other departments that are involved. When you do a street repave like utilities and not necessarily city departments like Edison and whatnot. Is that not part of this discussion tonight?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think the way to answer that is that this council has asked staff to look at a dig once policy, and we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are moving forward with that to the point where we're hopeful that within the next 30 to.'",
        "'speaker_0': '45 days, we'll be bringing an item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Forward to council to request authorization to implement a software program that would allow for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Coordination between all of the utilities and our city paving program. So if we know we're going to be paving Anaheim Street as an example in a year and a half, we would align that with any.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Water piping that needs to be done or sewer work that needs to be done or gas worked and needs to be done. We also are meeting with Edison on a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Regular basis to engage them as well as other public utilities, just so we can ensure that we're doing our very best to coordinate that work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then additionally, I think this council has strongly defended our five year moratorium, and I think that that's an important thing to bring up when we pay the street. We cannot allow another utility to go in and cut that street up for five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Years without coming to this council and getting support to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think that you've defended that very well and that ensures that our investment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is being maximized as best as it can.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all I have. Great job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. I just wanted to get a couple of things clear. And again, I want to thank you for the great presentation. You know, to our public works director, Mr. Craig Beck, you have a huge job, huge responsibility. But as was mentioned earlier, we have, I think, provided our city manager's office and public works department with a great'",
        "'speaker_8': 'deal of resources to get the job done. Resources that we couldn't have imagined having just a few short years ago. So again, I'll say it once. I'll say it again. Too much is given. Much is expected. We we we are expecting results that what was presented here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't want to I want to be clear, it wasn't a pavement management plan. This was more of it. And I'm glad you use the word outlining the system more of a pavement management analysis or assessment. We we are really looking forward to the phase two or the next conversation where we can get into the details.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I actually have a plan, a forecast and talk about what our deliverables will be to the taxpayers of Long Beach. And so, again, great presentation, big responsibility. And I have full confidence that we're going to be successful.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Last comment. I just want to follow up on something, Councilman Super. And I said and I mentioned this I think many times. I know Mr.. Mr. Beck and we talked about it recently, but the, the issue around utilities is so important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I feel like the, you know, it's taken a long time to get this policy in place, but we cannot continue to rip up streets. And because gas or water is doing a project and leave it in the conditions that we're doing, I mean, drive it down Atlantic, which used to look like a great street through parts'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the sixth District and going south and it just now has this Ms. colored. Formal water pipe looking, covering all up and down the street. And that's we're doing this all across the city. And I feel like there is not enough attention being paid to the fact that when a utility is going to be disrupt street a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'street project, it has to be repaved corner to corner the entire street and at a minimum, a slurry so that there isn't the discovering of pavements that happened. The other thing I hope you look at when we do this is when we redo streets and we've done this sometimes when when we even even when we redo a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'crosswalk at a four way intersection, we leave, you know, will darken that part of the street so that it's it's like a slurry just over the crosswalk and it's completely discolored to the rest of the street. And so we need to figure out a way of creating a clean palette of the streets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When something is when we're repaving a crosswalk, even a crosswalk or a corner, we're oftentimes fixing a four way stop. We're fixing a corner. And they were repaving like six feet away from the corner into the corner of the street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So now you have this dark piece that really throws off the entire look of the of the four way stop. So I just when we when this comes back, we're going to address the Street plan. But I also want to make sure that we've addressed the corner to corner we've pavement plan that we're not just paving over'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a small strip and then leaving the street discolored and that we're just doing a better job of making sure that visually we're leaving a good looking street and good looking just infrastructure wherever we go. Thank you, Councilman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To piggyback on what the mayor said, I think that there's also, at least from my talks with certain community members, whether it's true or perceived truth, we need to educate people at those seams is where we get potholes at those themes and where they start to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Deteriorate is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Often where water gets in and then the road starts to deteriorate. And we've pave over, over and over and over and over again. So. To another point about utilities. Perhaps it could if you want to bring back. Or we can discuss an item where if Southern California Edison is not ready to get their stuff done, too bad'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we're going to move forward. And then when they need to come back, they'll pay for the whole street to be paved again. Because I have recently undergone a process with Southern California Edison to get some things installed at the county.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the process has been us dragging them to water to get them to meet deadlines and things like that. And I don't want our residents to have to suffer and wait for their street to be delayed because the the agency hasn't met the requirements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if we need to create a city policy or ordinance that says we give them notification, and if they are not responsive within a reasonable period of time, that they will be fiscally responsible to repave that street again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then I'm open to doing something along that line, something that would motivate them to prioritize our residents in our projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I could not agree more with the mayor on the issue of when we have utilities that are worked on and how that impacts the streets. We actually have some beautiful streets in in my neighborhood that really didn't need any work until the utilities were worked on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And now they look awful because the street is multiple colors and it just I'm sure on the pavement management index, it would rate really well because the street was fine before they ripped it up. But it just looks it just it just happened recently on Sixth and Santiago.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If you guys want to drive and look at it, first of all, we had to drive over the utilities that had not been refilled for days. And so everybody's cars were you know, the neighbors who lived on the corner were getting the noise.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's just took three or four or five days for them to get filled. But it's a shame when that happens because it degrades the quality of the street and it degrades the quality of the neighborhood. So to the extent that we could be mindful of that, where we have control, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The other question that I had is how often do we do we have any system in place for refreshing paint? Like stop, you know, the stop painted stop signs, crosswalks? I mean, is that is that done as reported or do we have a system that's similar to Pavement Management Index that requires you to go out and assess'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Price. We do have some small.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amount of street maintenance dollars available.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wouldn't call it a program where we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Systematically go throughout the city and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Repaint everything. We tend to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Address it on a case by case basis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Generally through either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember offices or complaints that we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Receive from the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, I think that's something we want to take a look at, because even the pavement management index may say that a particular street is not in poor condition, but if the paint is completely worn out or the the signs on the street are cracked, then it appears as though the condition of the street is not very good'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And I think just a fresh coat of paint at the crosswalks at stop signs makes a world of difference. And there have been times that I've called myself or John Go Long Beach app for it and I didn't realize that the funding was so scarce for that because to me it seems like that's a really great way'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to refresh the look of a street at a much lower cost than than repaving or doing a slurry. So I think that's something we need to think about because I think degraded paint just just does not look makes the street just look much worse than it really is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I want to thank you guys for the work that you put into tonight's presentation. And I'm mindful that there's a lot more to come as we go into budget season. So thank you for taking a look at this from a broader view and helping us assess priorities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think I think Councilmember Mongeau made a statement a few minutes ago that is really accurate and that is as as it relates to many of these things, there are public perceptions and we have to do a better job of educating on the costs and the processes associated with streets and sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think that's a question. That's an area where we get asked a lot of questions, as Councilman Urunga mentioned. And so the more you can educate us, the better we'll do at representing the priorities that we set as a council and the justification for that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And to ask thanks. And I have to add these in here. So when it's important and I know it'll save me the multiple conversations we always have about these things. The other thing I want us to look at when this when I hope this policy comes back and I'm not sure if the the dig one's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'policy is coming back, but I'd like actually to see what are what the actual policy is. I think we I want to know exactly, you know, what exactly our policy is when it comes to how we repave streets for utilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to know what the timing issues are. I still I will often drive over a street and it will be like six weeks of markings on the street that the utility has come by and done. And a project won't start for a month after the markings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so do we require or do we have rules about when utilities can actually make markings? I mean, I kind of feel like those markings should be made like a week before the project, not a month before the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the markings will stay after this. You know, oftentimes on the sidewalk weeks and weeks after the actual street project is done, and those really, in my opinion, become blight and are almost like tags on the street that we end up leaving there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when we when we come back, we need to look at, you know, how we're how we're repaving the streets, how we're what is our policy and when it comes to markings. And so that we should, I think, be tougher on both our local and also the outside utilities to ensure that we're not we know that we're'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we understand what the rules are and that we know whether we can keep hold people accountable to making the streets look good. Also, just Mr. Beck, I there's a couple questions about the alleys and just my impression that we actually are repaving all of our dirt alleys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Isn't that part of measure? I think. Right. Mayor. Honestly, we have a $5 million commitment in measure for alleys and it will be up to this council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To adopt how that money gets prioritized. I think as staff, even though we're really not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fully prepared to share that with you this evening, certainly we believe that dirt alleys would be a priority because I was under the impression that when we discussed the Alice that the priorities were going to be the, you know, five or six dirt alleys that are remain in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those would be the first Alice fixed. That was my impression from, I think, Mr. Modica and Mr. West when we had the discussion a while back. Those were the target. The alleys that are currently dirt alleys would be the first Alice fix regardless of their location.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So part of what we wanted to do was do the data and take a look at the pavement management plan. And we had set aside $5 million in measure. And the data that you saw tonight shows that there is $5 million in dirt alleys.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Coincidentally, those numbers line up. So I think, as you heard Mr. Beck say, those were, we believed, would be a very good investment. And that does line up with the dollars and we'll be looking further at that recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. Any public comment on this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Before I start, I'd like to tell Miss Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She's spot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I wish I'd represent approximately 175 people in North Long Beach. We've been inflicted with this new so-called bicycle lane that you're putting in through here. We do not understand why the money is being wasted on this and why it is being put in when the money could be more used for the street maintenance, the repairing of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the alleys and other things. We've seen the disaster that it is up on Artesia Boulevard. I have talked with virtually every owner of businesses along through there and every one of them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do not like them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The young lady over here, she went through and in less than two days got 175 signatures. And I am sure that if I finish up going along the street and this is only on three blocks and Mr. Austin, these are going to you because these are all people in your district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a chance of getting people killed. I have seen what happens when you interact cars, people trying to get in and out, especially handicapped people or people in wheelchairs like my son in law. I cannot imagine you wanting to move my parking spot out into the middle of the street where it will be in conflict with'",
        "'speaker_8': 'busses and cars going through on Orange Avenue. The speed limit for you there is 35 miles an hour, and I'd be willing to bet that the average speed down that street is 50 miles an hour. Can you imagine a mother trying to get her child into the back seat, into a child seat?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And someone told me, well, why doesn't she just go in through the passenger side where she has two children? What about someone in a wheelchair trying to get in and out of a out of a vehicle? I think that this is a hazardous thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have photos to kind of give you an idea of what it looks like. It's dirty. There's no place to put trash cans out onto the street. I understand we want to become more friendly as far as bicycles are like that, but I don't think this is an appropriate project for North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it's money that has been wasted. We could have what it cost to do what they're doing. And if they put those black rubber things that they have on on Artesia Boulevard, along through that street, that's going to cost another $100,000.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I don't know how far $100,000 would go towards fixing an alley, but I'm sure that that would be a far better thing to do with our money. This particular rise in the sidewalk and all that, you see this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My daughter, when she was six years old, fell and broke her arm. She's 38 years old now and this has been there that long. And this is their answer to fixing this pouring asphalt. There's another picture of these things and I've got pictures of unsafe cars parked and what it looks like with trash cans out there and'",

        "'speaker_0': 'If we could read him.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. So as as most everyone here knows, bike theft is a continual problem throughout the city, but not just for our city, for for many cities in the region and throughout the nation. The problem that we see with bike thefts is that, unfortunately, they are underreported.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the data that is maintained by our police department and many other police departments doesn't accurately reflect the the magnitude of the problem in Long Beach. We have 30 to 40 reported bikes, reported stolen bikes every month. And many of the reported many of the bikes are not even reported stolen.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Bikes are the only item of personal property that we have that we actually leave outside in public for extended periods of time. And we have, generally speaking, no documentation of ownership. People don't report their bikes missing when they're stolen, so the data doesn't show the full story.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And when they do report it, they often don't have a serial number, make or model or any photos they can provide to the police department to get the bike returned to them. There are currently opportunities for residents to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Register their.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Bikes through a few different companies, but the data is not connected to the Long Beach Police Department, making it impossible for the police department to access those databases and get stolen bikes returned to their owners. This item came about in order for the city to get more proactive and take an active role in confronting this growing problem'",
        "'speaker_11': '. It's important that the public be a part of the solution, so making registration easy for individuals is essential. And why a program like this needs to be free to encourage people to sign up and voluntarily ensure that such a program is not punitive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We see cities up and down the state dealing with this problem, and if we're to claim we are a bike friendly city, we need to find ways to reduce bike thefts occurring citywide. Bike theft and any theft should not become so normal that we accept it as a part of urban life or a cost of living in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a coastal community like Long Beach. Craigslist and eBay, for example, have made it even easier for bike thieves to sell bikes or bike parts. We see bike thefts, funding, additional criminal activity, as we have seen nationally, bike thefts being used as a currency for possession, for purchasing controlled substances, for petty theft and property crime, because bikes are'",
        "'speaker_11': 'vulnerable and can be stolen relatively easily. We can't expect the residents to fight this problem alone. So the city getting involved by providing an easy way for individuals to register their bikes and have their bikes returned to them if they're found is, in my opinion, a common sensical approach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This item requests a report back from our hopefully our multiple departments working together to determine whether or not we can create an app based program that allows residents to register their bikes with the police department so that the bikes can be better tracked and returned to their owners if in fact, they are retrieved at a particular location'",
        "'speaker_11': '. I asked my council colleagues for their support in moving this item forward so that we can determine from the city what is feasible with the resources that we currently have in place, so that we can be a little bit more proactive with tracking bikes and allowing bike owners to have a vested interest in the investigation and the'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And and they give you a little sticker and a number, and your bike was registered and protected. And I'm surprised, actually, that that we got away from that. I think we need to go back to that. Unfortunately, in this day and age of of bigger and better bikes and more expensive bikes, especially, this type of program is'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You know, being in the age of information, we have easy access to right on our fingertips. But, you know, bike registration apps would improve the line of communications between our department and residents and would also reduce the storage of unregistered and recovered bikes and decrease the number of bikes registered as theft and loss.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, thank you. I want to thank my colleague for bringing this item forward and reaching out to the second district on it. Obviously, in our district we have chop shops and alleyways behind my house that we continually to go back and try to catch the guys, also our parks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I personally have had three bikes stolen in our city, so I feel the pain. So I think this is a great idea, making it be something that's accessible to everybody that that we can. So I just really hope that we come back with some exciting new opportunity that we can broadcast and use widely.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to praise the councilwoman for her commitment to bikes and bikes after I know that in the fifth District, what we're trying to do is get people to keep track of the information that Councilman Price talks about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what I definitely want us to also explore as a part of this is there are already bike registries and within the last several months, different bike registries have started to merge to make a national bike registry. And so I think that it is important for people to take the time to register their bikes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that what we really need to look at is some kind of partnership with the organizations that sell bikes. I know that it is challenging that not all places that sell bikes take as much ownership as, say, a bicycle shop like a performance bikes or a jacks bikes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of places when you buy a bicycle at a generic big box store, they don't give you any encouragement or information along with the registration of that bike. And so how to register that bike. And so what I know is challenging is that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The culture in which we owned bikes has changed. And you don't just go down to the fire station anymore and register your bike. But the fire service is also changed and our calls for service are up and the number of calls are up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I don't want the city to take on a responsibility if we can also, as a part of this item, explore the options that are available for partnership and to potentially find perhaps a partnership program with the bike shops in the city to take the ownership.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because what is challenging for me to say once again is we already have apps in the city that need significant time and effort. And I'm still frustrated that our Go Long Beach app is still not at top shape.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's marginal at best at this point. And so what I don't want to do is create more apps are online data portal is still not to where it should be. And so while I support the general idea of this, I just don't see that our departments have made the strides that we need to in technology to open'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up another platform. And so I'll be supportive of the study, but I really hope that in it we bring back alternatives where we don't have to take the ownership of another app, where where the world is changing and the platforms are changing and the city is not yet at the speed we need to be to keep pace'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you, Councilmember Supernanny.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. I was happy to sign on to this item. The one thing I did request is that the app would work with fares that we might have on the weekend, so that it's an easy app application that if we had a bike fare or something, we could have a canopy set up to registered bikes at our'",
        "'speaker_12': 'various events. We have also. Not only do I support Councilmember Price's idea that it should be cheap or free. I think we have to look at incentives. And an example I'll give you is 20 years ago, Cal State, Long Beach had a real bad bike theft problem.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So they came up with a plan where if you registered your bike, you got a you lock for $5 and it was a $30. You like I'm not saying we can put something that robust together, but let's look at those opportunities, too, as we move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I agree. I think there might be some grant opportunities available since we're encouraging more bike ridership that we can explore. Just a couple of quick points that I wanted to make. The Councilwoman Mongo is correct there. There has been for many years a national bike registry and it recently merged with I think it's the company I forgot'",
        "'speaker_11': 'project 5 to 9. And the problem is that, yeah, that's wonderful for residents to register with the national registry, but Long Beach PD is not connected to it. So so we used to be, but we no longer are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So obviously that's something that we will also consider. But in regards to the app base, that was just a suggestion because obviously the way people would register would be through the Internet and sometimes that's a little bit more cumbersome.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it would be.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Using technology that already exists or that is being used in other cities for us to be able to make it easy for people to register, which is the whole point of it. And I think on moving forward, we have a lot of emphasis on bikes in the city and if we're going to do that, we may want'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to. And I thought I talked about this with Craig Beck. We may want to think about an app that is kind of a bike friendly app so that even the bike rentals that we have, the bike share program, you can keep everything in one place almost like a bike wallet, where all the information that you need in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'regards to getting around town, whether it's maps, whether it's the bike share card code that you need, all of that could be through one particular app with so many different apps in the city of Long Beach, we just recently looked at the newsletter that the Go Long Beach newsletter that we have, and it had featured the go'",
        "'speaker_11': 'along beach apps that we have, that we have some police department specific ones, we have some public works specific ones. I know there's someone here from our I.T. department. We're doing a lot of great things with allowing residents to report things and file things more readily through an app or through the Internet.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if we can do that with bikes, I think we'll be in great shape. So I look forward to seeing the report, too, and excellent comments by my colleagues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any public comment on the registry? Mr.. GOOD. You.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's certainly a good idea. And I think we should also consider given the impact. Do run the numbers and. Get a firm figure, a firm handle on the benefit of getting people out of cars onto a bike. Whenever they can.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then. Figure out its aggregate benefit in terms of reduction of smog, traffic and all the nine yards that are connected with going someplace. And then increase the fine, which is deadly, and make it a 3 to 5 year prison sentence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In addition to that. I think we're. I'm not a techie guy and my Homer Simpson isn't around tonight, so I can't ask him. But it seems to me that one of the things we could do is develop same type of devices that can be in cars that when they manufacture or you get it from the dealer, they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'can weld into the frame of the bike, a tracking device. And I don't know how long the battery would last like that, but it would certainly, I think if the volume is there, that would drive that down and so you'd be able to track it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think going back to the original penalty, I think it should make it to find some people in Sacramento. That understand the import of it and pass a law that it would be. Put them away for 3 to 5 years period.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And increase the increase in the penalty that would bring it down dramatically. Couple that with the tracking device and I think probably 95% of the problem would go away. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Mayor, council members, we have a presentation by our finance department, our deputy director of Finance, Leah Erikson, as well as our purchasing manager, Sandy Sung Palmer. So I'm going to turn this over to Leah to walk over how we can do a good job, what we do with getting local folk in our procurement process, what we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'do good and what we can do better. Leah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm actually going to turn it over to Sandy Sang Palmer, who will be taking us through the presentation for you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the City Council. At its meeting on August 9th, 2016, the City Council asked the city manager to create a comprehensive plan to recruit and include Long Beach businesses in all city of Long Beach purchasing opportunities, as communicated in a memo to the Mayor and City Council dated April 13, 2017.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff has conducted a review of the city's current efforts, completed a benchmarking survey looking at the efforts of other agencies, and identified a plan to further strengthen our existing program. And this presentation will give you an overview of staff's findings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Overall, what we have found is that Long Beach efforts are among the best of the agencies surveyed. We have a number of activities that are of direct or indirect benefit to our local business community, which I will outline in later slides.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that said, Council asked us to take a look for opportunities for improvement, and we did find some areas where improvements can be made, both from our own review and by looking at those other agencies. And those opportunities will also be discussed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First, it's important to note that all of the city's practices related to procurement are reflective of and coordinated with our specific regulatory environment. In addition to our own charter, there are state contracting code requirements that allow cities to advertise and do some local preference, but still require us to go with low bid and do not allow us'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to only use local businesses. Also, we have funding sources or certain types and scopes of work that may require contractors to comply with additional requirements. And some of those requirements may benefit local businesses and employees. And also, California law prohibits both discrimination and preferential treatment on the basis of race and gender.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's sort of the foundation for some of our policies and programs here in Long Beach. The slide presents some high level information from the benchmarking conducted by staff, which included agencies identified by the City Council, along with others identified by staff's research.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the major components we looked at was local preference. Under California law, local preferences intended to offset price disadvantages for local businesses when there is a higher cost of living and operating locally. The local agency, which is in this case the city, treats bids from local businesses as discounted by a set percentage for comparative purposes when'",
        "'speaker_2': 'determining the lowest responsible bidder. And as you can see from the chart, our local preference is the second highest percentage of all agencies surveyed. The acronyms in the last column, which are defined at the bottom of the slide, indicate that some agencies limit the reach of their local preference programs to certain sizes or types of business enterprises'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And Long Beach offers a more broad based local preference that is a separate tool from our Small Business Enterprise program. Among broad based local preference programs, we have the highest local preference percentage. We looked at outreach activities of the agencies shown, and there was a wide range of outreach activities and levels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Long Beach has a strong outreach foundation that uses multiple avenues to reach local businesses. However, one aspect we saw through the benchmarking was that some agencies had branded their programs for better marketing of the services they provide, and this is an area that we think we can improve upon, and this will be discussed later on in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'staff report. So regarding our existing program, we currently spend $88 million annually with local businesses. We do offer that 10% preference for local businesses that was outlined on the prior slide. We have an SBA program where we set contract goals to encourage small and local business participation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also have a small business incentive program that provides credits towards business license, tax bills to encourage small businesses to start, expand and relocate in the city. And we have an online bitters tool that we use to we recruit local businesses to register in it, and then they receive electronic notifications for procurements that are relevant to them'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We do targeted advertising to local businesses. This is through the Long Beach Business Journal and as well as to community based organizations via email blasts. And we make some special efforts for outreach at local events, including matchmaking sessions, where we meet with local businesses and help them identify procurements that are appropriate for them and help get them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'registered in our bidders database. We also conduct email and phone outreach to prospective vendors. We compile a list of prospective vendors based on the particular procurement, and that is out of our database as well as research specific to that procurement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do direct outreach to vendors who have, after that point, access to our online documents to encourage them to follow through with a bid. We have developed written instructions and phone support that is targeting small and local vendors to help them navigate the procurement system and upload process that they might not be as familiar with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we also have online resources that are targeting small and local businesses to help them meet the procurement requirements, such as help with insurance opportunities and that sort of thing to meet our regulatory requirements. And we also conduct PRE-BID conferences for complex projects to help vendors understand the specifications and the compliance requirements that apply to those particular'",
        "'speaker_2': 'procurements. Many of these efforts that were described as beneficial to local businesses also help support small businesses, minority owned businesses and women owned businesses. We specifically target these particular business types by doing targeted email blasts to a number of community based agencies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've listed a few examples on the slide. The top two that are listed alone have a combined circulation of over 12,000. We also when we do these blasts, we explicitly state our commitment to providing maximum opportunities for these types of businesses, and we encourage them to register in our bidder's database so that they can become aware of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our procurements, which are then provided on a weekly basis. We also, once we have businesses registered in our Bittar database, they identify as belonging to the various categories. And then when we come back to Council on particular Procurements, we then report back to show the effectiveness of that outreach for those particular procurements in the body of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'council letters. So I would like to walk through an example procurement to demonstrate how some of these efforts come together. For a recent procurement that came to council, which was a vehicle purchase for multi-year, we would have previously already recruited businesses to register and planet bids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would have taken a moment to see if there were any other businesses we could identify that we should also reach out to to get them registered in our database. We would then use that database and that research to develop a prospective bidder list that would include local vendors as they were available to provide the goods or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'services. And then we would conduct outreach prior to the PRE-BID meeting to inform them of the opportunity and to provide them any additional information or encouragement to compete. And then we would do additional follow up at the close of the bid window to encourage vendors to submit those responses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this, we believe, is of particular benefit to local businesses to provide a bridge to help them get engaged in our procurements. And so I've shown some statistics here on that particular procurement. I'd like to note that I have a correction to the table on the downloaded bid row.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I apologize that last second the last column should say nine, not 11, and then the percentage would be 27%. But what this is showing is the fact that we have reached out on a number of outreach calls and tried to encourage and engage those local SB and B and WB, which is minority and women business enterprises to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'get engaged in the process and be competitive in our procurements. And so what I show here to demonstrate the benefit of some of those phone calls, this slide is showing the real life examples of our outreach calls from that particular procurement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These outreach calls range from encouraging participation in the procurement to providing technical assistance to the vendors, to providing clarification on the procurement itself. And again, that's that bridge to help local businesses or who tend to be small businesses participate in our procurements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So as I mentioned in the beginning, we were looking for areas for improvement and we did find that there are opportunities and wanted to start with the fact that, as mentioned, some of the other programs that we saw had significant marketing efforts that ensured that local businesses were more aware of the resources available to them through the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city. While we do outreach, we believe that creating more of a branding and marketing effort of our opportunities to make it more recognizable to the business community could provide additional benefits to ensure that those local businesses are aware of those opportunities, and that would help us reach more of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we'd also like to look at opportunities to coordinate with other city programs and resources in order to again continue to expand on how many businesses we are able to reach with our given resources. And both of these planned improvements align very well with the economic development blueprint and financial management has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have connected with the Department of Economic and Property Development and will be looking to coordinate our efforts with them. And for example, we may be able to use Billboard as an opportunity to get out some additional information about our procurement process and get people more involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also are looking for ways to create more and better opportunities for local business participation, and we believe there's some potential to do that. A couple of ways that we think we can do so is to use our bidders database to help provide a source for our informal, quote, process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So our bidder database is primarily driven towards our formal procurements. But departments are engaging in a lot of informal procurements, and getting them our bitter database as a tool will help them reach more local businesses. And we also want to evaluate transitioning to a more detailed commodity and service type code, because the way that we match our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'vendors in our database currently with our procurement opportunities is that they self-identify with the types of procurements that they're interested in. And right now, those categories are probably a little more broad than they need to be. And there's an opportunity to go to more detailed commodity codes to better make those matches.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And both of these improvements are integrated into our ERP project known as LP Coast ERP being the replacement of our financial and H.R systems. So these these are things we'll be looking at and have begun looking at already.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're also looking for opportunities to we believe that there might be opportunities to simplify our documents and requirements to make participation for local businesses easier. And some of that might be to review our bid and RFP documents to identify ways to simplify, modernize them and make them more approachable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also to evaluate whether or not we're using the appropriate requirements based on the risk level of the procurement. So essentially to look at possibly creating a sliding scale of requirements and where feasible to improve vendor education regarding some of our requirements that we have on our procurements related to state, local and federal regulations such as labor compliance'",
        "'speaker_2': 'requirements, so that they can better navigate that regulatory environment. We also believe that we can continue to support and strengthen local businesses ability to compete and succeed on our PS we. Many of the planned improvements that I just described are equally applicable to our PS as to bids and so they will directly benefit local businesses ability to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'compete on those RF PS as well as the bids. And while there are some legal hurdles to overcome, we will also be continuing to work with City Attorney to explore whether there are any additional ways to apply some form of local preference to RFP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in summary, we have a lot of great efforts to support local businesses participation in our procurements, but we do believe that they can be improved and we have some work to do and we've already started making some of those first steps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that, I will conclude my staff report and I'm available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And now we're moving on to Councilwoman Pryor. I'm sorry. Go back to Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Thank you, Sandy, for the report. This was a great report. When I first initiated the item back in August, I wanted to make sure that we were creating a definitely highlighting what we have existing, but also adding a bit more and making that more robust.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it seems that we're headed in the right direction. And so I thank you and the team for your work, Leah, as well. Thank you very much. So a few things, a couple questions. And I also have some suggestions just looking over a few of the of our adjacent cities and what they've done as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think we certainly can do more specifically the marketing as we talked about. I do feel that we need a name to this plan. Pasadena has a buy local plan. Whittier, I think Whittier is Whittier first something of that regard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this could be anything I mean, Long Beach business is first. I don't know what that will look like, but I definitely envision a, you know, a marketing strategy in that sense to be able to allow people to know that this is a place that they can invest, but also that will be given preference.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I think we're headed in that direction. In addition, there's a few other points encouraging city department heads to purchase local as well. Do we have that in our plan? It seems to be informal, but it would be nice to have that included as well, creating more of a culture of local procurement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then, as we mentioned, it seems that we are doing quite a bit of business community outreach. Of course, our business improvement district districts, regional Hispanic Chamber does a great job of letting the general public know about the local opportunities available.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'However, I think we can push it a bit further. Are we offering this information in various languages? Not at this time, no. Okay. I would suggest that we do that through our language access policy, because I believe that this the Spanish speaking community, the Cambodian community, they only they feel more comfortable reading in their native language.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think it's another opportunity and avenue for us to market to these businesses in that sense. I personally have a lot of Latino owned businesses. Many of them I can speak to in the language. But I think that they would appreciate having that information, especially because it could be so technical in a different language and then'",
        "'speaker_11': 'promoting the benefits of our successes. So do we have I see that we have a table here with our information. You know, the WHO has registered in Planet Bids, downloaded, submitted bids. And then do we have a comprehensive information as to how many have been awarded overall and over a certain period of time, are we capturing that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'data to know how many minority owned businesses, women owned businesses that we currently that currently exist and that are working with the city? Do we have that information?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have it available for procurements that we are conducting centrally. Currently, we do not have that information available at the department level for underneath the central purchasing threshold. And that is something that I believe we will explore whether there are opportunities to do so under lbe coast as we're looking for what abilities we have there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not something we've gotten into that level of detail on. So I, I'm not sure if it's there, but it may be and it's something that we'll look to do if it is okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would suggest that and I know other cities have a vendor list that they keep that is just ongoing, you know, based on the various opportunities available. But it would be good to have that information so we can quantify that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And as we're promoting to to be able to let the general public know that this is, you know, we have X amount of women business owners that are working with the city. I think that would be a great point for us to talk about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then I know we're encouraging current suppliers to subcontract as well with local suppliers, so I'm happy to see that talked about the business strategy. In addition, I know there have been some other cities that have fared well with a vendor fair of sorts, whether that's held at City Hall or any general location.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think it would be good to have some sort of event of of sorts that invites local businesses so they can understand face to face with some of our city employees as to what the process is and how they can be a part of the opportunities available.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In addition, as far as our website, where does this currently exist? Because I tried looking myself and it was a bit cumbersome to find where you would even find the process to look for opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman. I agree. When we were looking at our own resources, we found some immediate opportunities to realign the access online to our information. Specifically, there's some really great resources that are set up through economic and property development where they're they've consolidated the information available to businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And currently, our information is on the financial management page, which is not quite as intuitive to businesses that are coming on to our website. And that is something that through the branding and marketing improvements, we would like to look to consolidate and make more visible.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, great. That would be wonderful because it right. It's not very intuitive. You would often think maybe it's under economic development or some other place. So great. I also think there's an opportunity at our development services desk as people are coming in, applying for business licenses or they're asking about expanding their business, what have you, that perhaps'",
        "'speaker_11': 'brochures could be made that highlights this opportunity. So I think any touchpoint that we have here at City Hall to provide additional marketing, that would be great. And then lastly, the ways that we can work to incorporate local procurement preferences for RF piece.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know that we are working on that, but it would be good to get additional information from our city attorney as to what could be done in that respect. I know that there are legal challenges and hurdles that we need to, you know, work with, but any way possible that we can provide additional opportunities, that would be'",
        "'speaker_11': 'wonderful. Now, all of that said, you know, I don't I guess the intention of this item was not to make you know, to put it out there and not have anything happen. I would like actually for us to report back again on additional I know I don't want to continue prolonging this, but I think it's important that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we report back with the implementation of all of these items. I think a lot of the business individuals that I've been talking to really want to see something that works for them. And it would be great to find out, you know, how we're going to market, who we're going to market to and including all of these recommendations'",
        "'speaker_11': ', creating how are we going to create, encourage a better culture with encouraging city department heads, how are we going to promote benefits and data? So it would be great to come back to council. I don't I know this item took a while.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, I would say 30 days, but that might be too tight. So what would be I'm going to leave it open. I'm completely open to this. I know that it's not crucial, but I want to leave it open for a good time to come back.'",
        "'speaker_11': '120 days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Go ahead. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Leah or Sandy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that we can come back in 120 days and give you an update. Some of the items identified for improvement may extend beyond that time frame, but we could certainly update you on our progress on where we are on those items.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, great. That would be wonderful. And if it could be reported back here to the council, the full council, that would be great. And we can then go on to next steps and if you need to, I can also send additional recommendations in writing as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or did the recommendations that I included. I'm sorry. Thank you very much for the work, though. I appreciate it. I think our city is headed in the right direction. As I mentioned with this program in the beginning, it says a good program made better.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'd like to see this be a great program made better so I know that we'll get there. And I thank you both for your work in this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price, let me go to Councilmember Wingard, who is the second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. Very thorough. Councilmember Gonzalez, you've addressed a lot of the issues that I had. And I want to ask specifically, when you're talking about maybe women's small business, enterprise, women, own breed appraisers, minority owned enterprises skills are that's not reported here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I didn't see any kind of strategy actually in how to address that need for representation and diversity in our procurement process. So you addressed that very well, and I will glad you did, because it's important to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have to know that. We have to let people know businesses that we are accepting of all applications that in fact we do not have. You know, that we have a nondiscrimination policy when it comes to procurement, regardless of race or gender.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that and I'm glad that that will be addressed. The other point that I wanted to to ask about was when we look at the types of outreach that is done out there, you named a few here in terms of the regional Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Black Business Association and other local maybe WEAVES and other organizations'",
        "'speaker_6': 'like that. Are you concentrating those in the Long Beach area or are you looking at it regionally? Because I think that would be important as well when we we're doing that kind of outreach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member the majority of the community based organizations that are on our distribution list are local, a few are regional, and we are looking for opportunities to expand that list.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, because I think talking about if we're going to be making an impact and having more diversity in our vendors, we need to look beyond just Long Beach. I mean, there's a regional organizations that we can look at to help with in their recruitment and the procurement process as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would want to see outreach in these areas, especially because, you know, when you look at when you really consider it, while Long Beach might be a large, considered a large city, some of these are procurement opportunities, are very specialized in nature.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you're not going to get that specialized vendor that is a a small a women owned or minority owned business or you stay within Long Beach, you have to go outside of that. So I want to see some outreach opportunities to go into those other other areas as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm speaking generally in terms of a regional effort. Tara, you made a great, excellent point in terms of, you know, getting a brochure ready. And a lot of times it's education. I mean, a lot of vendors are really aware of what our process is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I've had a lot of and I'm sure, as all of us have, I'm on the city council. We get people, make appointments with us to talk about, to sell, to sell their business to us. And we always ask them, are you on our vendors list or have you talked to our.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Managers have regarding getting on the list and what the process is in doing that. And I as I refer them over there and and I really don't know at this point if they actually contacted you or not and what the follow up was, if any at all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would like to see some feedback on that when I'm able to refer somebody to you a little note saying, I met with so-and-so, who whom you refer to us can, you know, we're looking at their application or we've we've guided them through the process, giving them some information just so that it could close the loop'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in terms of when I meet with with potential people who are going to who want to do business with us and knowing that they got they got served. Because there have been a couple of occasions where I've had small business people come back to me and says, you know, I tried to contact your people, but they never'",
        "'speaker_6': 'got back to me. So I would like to to have an opportunity to close those loops and perhaps we can have some kind of a report or at least a feedback in terms of who you talked to when he talked to them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just to close the loop for for my benefit so that I know that they've already been they've been helped or assisted. And on page 11, 11 and 12, page 12, you have there your first bullets continue to support and strengthen local businesses ability to compete in success on RFPs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How do you what surprises you do that? How do you support and how do you strengthen their abilities? I mean, is there a is there a plan? Do you have a plan? Is there an effort that you're doing in terms of educating these potential contractors with the city in regards to the process?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is there are there workshops that you put together on a yearly, monthly, quarterly basis that would invite people to come in, learn about the procurement process of doing business with Long Beach? Do you have one now? You have a plan or can you explain that item for me a little bit?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember your target currently we go out to a lot of community events that are local events to educate vendors on how to do business with the city. We speak at local vendor fairs and do outreach at various trade events, and that is part of what we do at those events.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do that equally for bids as well as for RFP, as a lot of our outreach strategies are dedicated towards both bids and RFP. And so we're capturing RFP in our outreach efforts. So we have not we have been engaging with the business community at those community events and through our phone and Internet outreach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I so if I understand you correctly, then a lot of that is done through the RFP, RFQ process. Is there a you say a general is talking about the website? I would I would guess I didn't I haven't done it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I would guess that if you go to Long Beach dot gov, there's going to be a link that would provide people with information on the types of procurement opportunities that are there with the city or RFP that are currently active or those types of those that type of information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. If once on our website, you're able to navigate to our portal for procurements where you can go in with inquiry access to see a listing of the current procurements, vendors can then register to see the details of those procurements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, and they would be also receiving information as to how to submit an application on our RFP, RFQ.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. Yeah. Those are my only comments at this point. I think that Councilmember Gonzalez had a very thorough presentation on this. It's her item. And right now I'm very, very, very confident that hopefully this this will I'm very confident that hopefully now I am confident they were going to come out with something that's going to be possible'",
        "'speaker_6': 'positive for our vendors and lobby. I'm especially and my city manager West knows that many times when we've come up with the awards of contracts that I'm always bringing up, how many minority and women owned businesses applied? Because that's very important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to we need to show that we are a business friendly city and that we do offer a lot of opportunities for people who are interested in applying with us that we are that we are looking at their application seriously.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I want to thank my colleagues for their comments on this topic. Very, very good discussion. The one question I have is if we adopt a policy at council, is every city department bound by it, including harbor or harbor department, gas department, water department, or does that have to be presented to them separately?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Harbor and water department will be separate their separate jurisdiction under the charter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And do we know I know for actor we do have a small business incentive and recruitment program and policy. Do we know if the harbor department has a similar policy?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe and I'll have to double check, but I believe they do have a policy. There is an issue with the harbor department and to a lesser extent with the water department on the restriction of those funds, the being tidelands funds in the harbor department, they would be prohibited from having a local preference.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great. Thank you. I have nothing further.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, first of all, I want to thank the financial management department for a very comprehensive presentation. I think most of my questions have been answered. My colleagues have asked excellent questions. This price you just saw, Councilmember Price, you just asked the question that I had in terms of enterprise funds and if they applied.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think the 10% local benchmark is something that we should be proud of. But, you know, I would just tell staff that we should be striving for continuous improvement. It's it's good to be good, but let's strive to be better and even the best.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The L.A. County, the 15%, I think, you know, that might be a benchmark for us to to look to to get to in terms of local procurement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm next, but we don't have an AMC if you're taking over NBC.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Mondale, you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. A couple of quick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Things so related to the other departments that are not bound. I completely agree with Councilman Price. Councilman Gonzales and I wrote a letter to another commission to discuss potential options. Are we able to refer to other commissions or recommend consideration or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, what is that process by which we can recommend that they consider local preference or let them know of our desire for them to to at least take a moment and consider it?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. That's been done in the past and certainly possible to do if it's a decision of the body to recommend to those commissions to consider a certain policy or direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'd like to add that to this motion. And then additionally with language, I do believe we need to do a better job of identifying specifically within the city of Long Beach. And when you look at the language access numbers, the two categories that were utilized were our Cambodian.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Access and our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hispanic population and Spanish speaking. And so potentially we should target the businesses in those particular corridors and categories. In L.A. County and East L.A., they did a walking outreach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Where they took.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some of our Spanish speaking staff members and did the outreach as a walk campaign where they let the community know in advance so that the store owners or the procurement managers would be there on a certain day. And then they walked that corridor and provided them the information they wanted in small groups where they felt really comfortable'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And then with relation to the local preference, currently at 10%. L.A. County has not yet had 15% for even a year yet. And so we don't know the implications or turnout of that percentage yet, but I think that we should keep an eye on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also related to our $88 million in annual spending, I think that's great. One of the other exercises that L.A. County did as a part of the budget process was they asked each budget manager before they after their ninth month budget status report to take all of the expenditures in their department and say, so take your household budget'",
        "'speaker_2': ', for example. If your household budget is, let's say, $1,000 a month and you already know you're going to spend X amount on your mortgage and X amount on this, that or the other, you know, those are set aside because you're committed for multiple years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But then they found out what percentage of their budget was discretionary and available for purchases on an annual basis in the S.A. categories, certain things obviously aren't available. For instance, you pay your utilities as a department and so on and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But outside of that, they said, here's how much could be spent on small businesses. And then they said what percentage they currently meet. And then they use that as an annual benchmark in their open data portal of where they show their budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think this is just another opportunity to talk about the open data portal and why it's so important. And then to loop in Councilmember your anchor's comments to the intention of the item as originally brought forth by Councilman Gonzales and myself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that we really want it to be focused on local and from the regional standpoint. One of the things I think we could work on is phase two. Of what I think Gina and I have talked a lot about is employ Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Employ Long Beach would be the next phase of a of a a buy local program. So we as the city of Long Beach need to buy from businesses within our boundaries. However, there are businesses that are outside of our boundaries where a majority of their employees.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Long Beach residents. And so that's that regional perspective that we could build that actually still benefits Long Beach and Long Beach residents. And so I know that within our statistics as a city, we currently ask every business owner, how many employees do you have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We could start asking that of our.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Contractors and ask them of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your total employee count. How many of them are Long Beach residents? And that will help us. Many of you read today that we're at a historic low with our unemployment rate of 4.4%. But if you're a business and you're willing to go out of your way to hire Long Beach residents or you're currently a Long Beach vendor'",
        "'speaker_2': ', you should be hiring Long Beach residents even if you're outside the city borders of Long Beach. And so I know we're not there yet, but just something to keep in mind. I appreciate everyone's feedback and comments and I look forward to a report back in 120 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'll accept those friendlies, by the way. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. You guys have said a lot. So I will say I agree. And I also want to echo the need to have it in multiple languages. We have a lot of business corridors, whether it's off of Anaheim or in other areas, that we just need to make sure that we include everybody that can be a part'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of it. So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You want to? Yeah, I just I just want to make a brief clarification on gun control bongo's referral to regional businesses versus local. I meant that obviously for minority owned businesses and women owned businesses, because I know that we're not going to have the high number of of those kinds of businesses in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it would it would be it would behoove us to go outside of Long Beach and recruit individuals from those from those communities to to encourage them to apply for opportunities here in Long Beach as well. So I'm looking at regionally for those those where we will find them here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's extend the application process a little longer so that we could do an additional recruitment or effort to advertise to ensure that we have a good, diverse applicant pool when we're looking at these various procurements. And the other question I wanted to ask also was, does this outreach and data, does it include like consultants?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know a lot of we talk about procurement. We're talking about maybe cards or or tree trimming or, you know, paving or whatever. But we don't talk about much about consulting services or or legal services. Are we looking at that as well?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Yes. When we're doing formal procurements through central purchasing, we are doing outreach on on services as well as as goods and contracts. And that includes professional services, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I just wanted to clarify my comments earlier. I know I compared Long Beach to L.A. County. L.A. County is a huge behemoth county with a large, very large scope. And so I know that's a that's a big number to get to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I recognize that I like to go public. Comment Now, is there any public comment on this item? Okay. It's been moved and seconded. Members, please cast your votes.'",
