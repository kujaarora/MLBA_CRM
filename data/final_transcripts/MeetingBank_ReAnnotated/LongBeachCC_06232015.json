    "Creation of Queen Mary Land Development Task Force.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication from Mayor Garcia and Vice Mayor Lowenthal, recommendation to request the city manager to convene a 12 member Queen Mary Land Development Task Force.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'll go ahead and just begin. I think there's there's no question that one of our city's greatest assets is the Queen Mary. It's been a classic icon of our skyline. It's something that we know a lot around the world.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're known for, certainly as we travel and we hear people's love of the ship. We also know the ship is going right now through a massive renovation, historical renovation, which we're also very, very proud of. We have an opportunity, as we all know, that surrounding the Queen Mary is about a little over 40 acres of land that's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'adjacent that can be developed. It is a land that is in a in a in a development partnership currently with Garrison Investments, which has been a great partner with the city. They own that. They control the land lease on the land.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But like a lot of great public projects, we I know myself and Vice Mayor Lowenthal, who represents that part of the of the city, believe it's now time to move forward, to really develop and think about what we build around the Queen Mary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have this huge project with the Civic Center that we've that this council has been involved with. We have other great projects happening across the city, whether it's the pool or others that are happening in other parts of town.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's time to put together a community group to really advise development services and our city management team on this as we begin this process. The reason this is coming forward now is because Garrison Investments, which holds the lease on the ship in the land, has begun really intense conversations with the city over the last few'",
        "'speaker_0': 'months about their willingness to now move forward. They're ready to move forward, to develop, and the city needs to have a robust community outreach process, part of which will be this 12 member development task force. And so I want to particularly thank Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She's been working on this for a very long time. And as we all know, it's an important piece of of her district. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and I appreciate the mayor's partnership, as well as his leadership on this particular issue, which didn't start just from the time he became mayor, but from the time that he was on the council. Many of you know, I've had a love affair with the Queen Mary since coming to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is an amazing asset that we should all be proud of. I'm proud of the fact that in the last eight years, the city's performed a comprehensive survey of the ship and its assets and developed a conservation management plan to ensure that the restoration and preservation follows best practices.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many of you that are here today or watching from home or will be reading about this tomorrow, will have been part of the community that's asked why has it taken so long? And I have to assure you that the first and foremost task before us, when the Queen Mary's history was turning a corner, was to be sure'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we preserved her as an asset. We preserved the historic aspects of the ship. And I am confident that that is the approach that was the right approach to take and one that we did take. And I know that the city and its residents are committed to maintaining this international icon and city landmark in the best possible'",
        "'speaker_6': 'shape for future generations to enjoy. That's something that I think a lot of us share in common. We want that because she has an incredible story to tell that spans multiple generations and cultures. And I hope that narrative continues for multiple generations into the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Beyond the welfare of the ship itself. One of the best ways to encourage more tourists and residents to visit her and learn her story is to invest in the property around her. We have over 40 acres that surround the queen that can be invested in and I think we should.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor Garcia and I have been discussing these development plans with Garrison Investments, which is the ship's operator at this time. And we're very motivated to see this property reach its potential. It's a critical place. It's a critical piece in our efforts to attract even more tourists, investment and businesses to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is a good time and project for residents and experts in related fields to help the developer and the city reach its full investment potential. This certainly reminds me of our volunteer committees for the Downtown Visioning Team.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know several of you have participated in that effort and subsequent downtown plan as well as the Queensway Bay Development and Project. If we think about the narrative that's gone on in the downtown, starting from the downtown visioning plan, this is the next chapter in that long narrative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is something that began a very long time ago before all of us here was were seated at our at the dais. But it's certainly one that we have a true role in ensuring what the future of the Queen Mary can be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With all the changes coming to the pike. Many of these changes have come up recently. Good changes, Shoreline Village and the Downtown. I'm very excited about the prospect of this property improving as well and very excited about the opportunity for the community to continue to provide feedback for what the vision of this area should be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Next up, Councilmember Andrus.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, I think I like to think the mayor and the vice mayor, because I want to thank for putting this item on the agenda tonight. You know, the queen mayor is one of our icon features in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the idea of the task force is a great indication that we will continue to move in the right direction to highlight our city's access. You know, since this community asset, I think it's a very important to have local community members on this task.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm very glad that you guys decided to look into this and make this one of our, you know, important items on the axis tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, too, want to thank each of you for bringing this item forward. I know it's been a long time in the making and we've been talking about it and it's finally here. So I'm glad we're moving forward with this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just had a quick question about the selection process for the committee. I understand it will be 12 members appointed by you, Mayor. There's a few different, I guess, pots of expertize that will be selected as well. Tourism, hospitality, design, will there be will the members be part of those different or how will that be selected exactly'",
        "'speaker_0': '? Well, I mean, I think the item is written down so that it were not too specific. We want to bring in people that have a variety of talents. But certainly I think the key component, of course, is residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they'll be downtown residents that actually are live with the impacts of any additional traffic or any issues there. But beyond that, we want to make sure that they're experts in a variety of fields and those are limited, but not to include but are not limited, of course, to hospitality and tourism and and other relevant architecture that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I too, want to speak on behalf of support of this item. I think that it's it's the right time. It's the right leadership of this city. And I know that the east side is looking forward to more. Types of events and things that we can come downtown and enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The civic center down by the water that we're all going to embrace together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I, too, want to support this item and thank you and the vice mayor for bringing it forward. I agree that in terms of the economic development and the discussions that we've had as a council, there are specific categories of economic development opportunities that we need to target as a city, including retail sales and residential housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm hopeful that this space could be utilized to stimulate further economic growth and development. I do want to say, I think it's very timely that I'm really impressed with where the pike is headed. And I think Vice Mayor Lowenthal and the mayor and others who have helped bring the development of that project into fruition, because it's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'really coming together nicely. And again, it's targeting our chief economic development goal, which is to increase our revenue and specifically our sales tax revenue. So I think this is just going to add to the progress. And it is this is something that residents ask about all the time throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm glad that we have something to report in terms of movement forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Turanga.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mayor. I, too, want to lend my voice to supporting this issue. The only thing I have to say is what took you so long? I know that we've had a lot of important issues before us in the last year, and this is one of those situations that I'm very proud to lend my support to, and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm looking forward to what arises out of the the task force, the recommendation they're going to make, because it's going to be going to complete the whole renaissance that we're going to be going through with downtown, with the pike, with the new civic center, and now including the Queen Mary.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm really looking forward to it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. And just to reiterate something the vice mayor said, because the leaseholder, of course, is gears is is a private firm, Garrison Investments. We're working on a on a timeline that works for both parties. And so we're both at the point now where it's time to move forward and and put a project together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I will support this. And because I think it is it's great to to build the task force. It's great to pursue economic development with input from our residents. I just want to remind you, you mentioned that stakeholders in the downtown will be included in this this task force.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would just not. Exclude anyone else from from the process, because we have this is a citywide resource. It isn't a six on the second district. But like our ranchos, they have board members and people engaged from all over the city like our our airport as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this is a citywide resource and I would just encourage that you look beyond the downtown for for qualified talent to be on this task force. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's actually part of the plan. So I encourage everyone to if there's fantastic people that please let me know, because we definitely want to do that. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to congratulate and applaud Vice Mayor Lowenthal and her leadership on this and you as well. Mayor Garcia, I think it's important, you know, the entire city seeing a renaissance, this important development happening in East Long Beach, in North Long Beach, in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I'm reminded of just this past week, I was in San Francisco on the waterfront and hanging out in a wind, checked out Ripley's Believe It or Not. And I went and visited an old ship that they had.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I was looking at a lot of the similarities that Long Beach has there. And and I was actually thinking about the opportunities on the other side of our waterfront. So I think it's really timely and I look forward to what comes out of this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Hopefully more fun. More fun downtown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q Councilmember Superdome.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to reiterate Councilman Austin's words that while we have downtown stakeholders, let's not neglect the etc's, too. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. Thank you. Any public comment on the item has come forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very good you. I fully support this. I think it's absolutely essential. I think the Queen Mary is an icon. It's one of the reasons why a year ago I suggested when they were going through wasting the money and renaming the the downtown transit mall station, that it should have been the Queen Mary station.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's an icon name, iconic name that would be recognized around the world. Downtown Long Beach doesn't ring any bells. One of the things that we should also consider is adopting a paradigm not unlike Disneyland. Because one of the problems I discovered and I discovered this a couple of years ago, about 14 months ago when I was talking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to a couple on the on going down to Del Mar or on the bus. And I said, Had you been to the Queen Mary? And they said, Well, we were going to go, but it was going to cost us $46.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then I got inside of that issue. And what had happened is because of the heathens, come down and get on there free. They destroyed millions of dollars. They incurred they destroyed and damaged millions of dollars worth of property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they have to they had to recapture that. So now they have a program, what you pay to get on, you can deduct from what you buy. So I'm suggesting one of the things we do is we just like if you're going to board a cruise ship, an airline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You get fingerprinted. You get a little passport for the day or the period of time, and that will scare away the element that we don't want. Nobody should object to paying those dollars. And I think we should be able to get the cost of a photo and a badge down to a negligible amount.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the people to keep it as a souvenir. That then will offset the cost of that, because I think it's absolutely essential to build up that iconic symbol of this city. And it's just sitting there and it just needs good management.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only thing I'm concerned about is that we get people on there, that committee that have zero experience in business and they're only experience is spending government money. So I would want to make sure that we have people that have operated and been responsible for PNL operations on a successful ongoing basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any of the public comment on this item? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I heard on a Unsolved Mysteries that the ship is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Haunted as one of you guys going to get Ghostbusters out there. Just a little joke there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, sir. Okay, let's see. Is there a more public comment on this Queen Mary issue? Just come forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. I do like the idea of a fingerprint. I think we should. We work with the police department to run a criminal background check to see if anybody going on the Queen Mary is committing any acts of, for example, shoplifting or any other.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because we don't need a bunch of criminals on the Queen Mary. So I do. The thumbprint criminal background check. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. So with that, everyone. So with that, we're going to go ahead and go and please cast your votes. And if obviously, if anyone is interested that watching from the public, please contact my office or we're making the appointment soon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please cast your vote on item number 11.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries nine zero.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Clerk. We're moving on to number 12.'"

    "Ordinance to Amend Title 6 of the Municipal Code on Urban Agriculture.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication from Vice Mayor Lowenthal, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Council Councilmember Superman and Councilman Andrews. Recommendation to request the city attorney to bring an ordinance within 30 days to amend Title six of the city's municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm going to turn this over first to up to Vice Mayor Lowenthal, and there may be some staff comments as well. So Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank everyone that has provided comment and sent in emails. I'm curious, Mr. Mayor, do you want to do our comments first or public comment? What do you think?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you wanted to yell, if you wanted to, at least make your motion. Make the motion, and then we can. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let me go ahead and make the motion first to go ahead and approve staff recommendation. And we have a second. So I do want to thank everyone that's provided their emails. I've received comments from friends in the animal care community who are passionate about the humane treatment of animals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've also received concerns from residents worried about the impact of these animals upon their neighbors and the burden of enforcement. And of course, we've received support from residents who already own or wish they could own these animals for a variety of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe that everyone's hearts are in the right place about animals. There are a number of reasons why my colleagues and I wish to reconsider this issue. And when I say reconsider, we have taken this up. I don't know how many years ago, but certainly it's been several years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have brought this forward for several reasons. Two, for reconsideration. One, it fits into our healthy and sustainable lifestyle city goals. It's a social justice issue, which I know Councilmember Gonzalez will touch upon. There's great interest from residents wishing to be closer to their food source.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When we look at the trends across not just our country, but if we just focus on our country, we are less and less trusting of of where our food is sourced. And so to provide residents an opportunity to source their own foods is something that's also very fitting in with our culture here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And frankly, I don't see any major difference in the responsibility from that we currently expect from our domestic animals, such as dogs and cats. And we have an expectation of those owners that we will continue to have in our series of expectations from owners of any other type of animal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is worth reminding everyone that our municipal code allows residents to own up to four large breed dogs in any size lot with no setbacks. We expect owners to clean up after their cats and dogs whose waste is arguably more impactful than chickens and goats.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we will have that same expectation. We expect owners to feed and maintain their animals. That's not just the Long Beach way. That's just the humane way when we enter into pet ownership. And why should owning chickens or goats be any different?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And these are questions that we're getting from residents challenging, adding these animals to our ordinance. And I think what we'd like us to all consider is why would it be any different? We already have enforcement codes in place for irresponsible animal owners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You'll hear from our staff later this evening to share with you the intense level of research and work they've done on this issue. Looking at what other cities are doing, not just in in Southern California, but across the country.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We should expect the same type of responsibility from owners of any pets, whether they be dogs, cats, chickens, goats, be owners. And if they don't, they should be reported to animal care services for enforcement. And I think you see that our animal care services staff is very responsive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've also heard that because there are bad dog owners or bad cat owners out there, we shouldn't allow residents to own chickens, goats and bees. And I think that's a very unfair, broad brush that we cast across across the canvas and one that I think we should be careful not to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's those two can be mutually exclusive. The attached ordinance reflects best practices that protect neighbors, animals and personal property, while providing residents with appropriate sized properties and facilities. The opportunity to pursue a particular lifestyle. A lifestyle that's in keeping with our city's efforts to encourage healthier eating, active living and sustainable practices.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think if you look at all of the progress we've made in our city over the last decade, one thing that we can all say that is a theme about the efforts that we've made is one toward healthier eating, active living and sustainable practices.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I have a few slides that I'd like to share with you on what the proposed changes are for each animal. The first one is the slide on the current what we have currently for chickens. And as you can see with the current ordinance, you can have up to 20, up to 20, maybe kept at least 50'",
        "'speaker_6': 'feet away, 50 feet from one in two family residences or 100 feet from multi-family residences, which are with three or more or hotels. One chicken may be kept as a pet at least 20 feet from any dwelling, and there's no permit or inspection required.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we advance to the next slide, you'll see what's being current, what's being proposed in this ordinance. So the proposal is that up to four, maybe kept ten feet from neighboring residents. No inspection or permit required five to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And maybe kept at least 35 feet from neighboring residents requiring permit and pre inspection. 11 to 20 may be kept at least 50 feet from neighboring residents residences, requiring permit and pre inspection and a proposed permit fee of $20.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One time pre inspection cost would be approximately $63, and that's one hour worth of an officer's time. The chicken shall be adequately fenced within an outdoor enclosure to contain the chickens on the property to prevent, escape and provided with a shelter to protect from weather and predators.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Outdoor enclosure must be a minimum of ten square feet of permeable land per chicken. For goats. If we see what the current is, we do allow one. No more than one may be kept at least 100 feet from neighboring residences.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They may not be kept south of Anaheim Street. And no permits required. With the proposal, what we have is that you may have to only may be kept ten feet from neighboring residences. Must be permitted annually by annual animal care services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And must be microchipped. Food products are for personal consumption only. Male goats must be neutered. Decent. Scented. And enclosure must be a minimum size of 250 square feet of permeable land for two miniature goats or 500 square feet of permeable land for any other combination of miniature and non miniature goats.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Adequate shelter must be provided within the enclosure to protect the goats from predators and the elements. And then we would be removing the location restrictions. We'd be removing the restriction that we currently have. Which states? South of Anaheim Street only.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And here's how the setbacks for the dwellings would look. And Mr. City Manager Which staff member do you have? Pat Westwood Staff Member Do you have that might address any of the questions?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have Ted Stevens and George Chapman could address anything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I just wanted them to be seated in case there were any questions either from us or for the public. So when you look at the dwellings, you can see where the clearance from the adjacent dwellings must be and where the boundaries are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When we look at the allowances for up to four chickens or goats, which is ten feet, 5 to 10 chickens, 35 feet, and then 11 to 20, and that's 50 feet. For bees. What we have currently is that hives must be kept at least a hundred feet from neighboring residences and public ways, streets and alleys.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they must be kept ten feet above the ground. Under the proposed ordinance. What we have is of up to four hives may be capped at least ten feet from the property line. There'll be no city permit requirements, however.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Any person desiring to keep bees must provide the city's Animal Care Services Bureau with proof of their registration with the County of Los Angeles and the hive entrances need to face away from or parallel to the nearest property line, and hives must be either screened so that the bees must fly over a six feet barrier, which may'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be vegetative before leaving the property or be placed at least eight feet above the adjacent ground level. And a water source for bees shall be provided at all times on the property where the bees are kept to discourage bee visitation at swimming pools, hose bibs and other water sources on adjacent public property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Public or private property. And before I close, I wanted to I'd like to ask my co-sponsors to add two friendly amendments. One is to remove the D horning requirement from the goat section and add the food products or for personal consumption only to the chicken section as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with that, Mr. Mayer, those are my comments for right now, and I thank my colleagues for their consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal and Councilmember Darrell now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And we accept those. All right. Accept those amendments. And what I'd like to do is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Just defer to my other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Colleagues. I originally brought this proposal forward as a member of the Sustainable City Commission, and I think the year was 2011. But in those days, our job was to advise the Environmental Committee.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now they advised directly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To city council. So I don't think there's anyone who's heard more testimony on this than myself, possibly Vice Mayor Lowenthal. So I'm well versed on on the topic, but I'd like to hear.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'From the other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council colleagues at this time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And actually, the council member, you actually probably want anybody here has more more experience and have heard testimony on this issue. As chair of the Sustainability Commission before coming to the council. So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilwoman Munger.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I have really enjoyed getting to hear some of the stories from our neighbors in the fifth District who currently host chickens, and then also working with the members of our community garden and others who have neighborhood gardens who really understand the need for more bees in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've been really impressed with the beekeepers of Long Beach during my time here as a council member and previously as a neighborhood leader. And the strong work that you've done to preserve the beehives that are available because the extermination of bees has been very difficult.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So very difficult on our environment and very difficult on our agriculture as a state. And so I look forward to moving the city forward in a direction of urban agriculture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. First of all, I'd like to thank the vice mayor for asking me to sign on to this item. You know, I think that this is a small number of people that have actually got the idea of the urban farm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And these individuals have been very responsible. You know, on the social, economic standpoint, you know, it's really hard for you know, it's really hard for families to even keep food, you know, on their tables, in their opportunity for this family to have fresh and affordable food.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think an item like this could really help all of us if you really choose to get behind it and see what we're trying to do. Because fresh food, you're talking about your health, you're talking about everything and what would be better way to do it than grow it yourself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I really want to thank you, Vice Mayor, for allowing me to sign on with this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mayor. Originally, I had a whole ton of concerns about this item here because there were a lot of questions I had regarding licensing and and the number of animals that could be kept in one location. And those have been those are being addressed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm glad to see that. But I still have a few, if you don't mind my asking, in regards to those that require inspections or inspections, I know they're going to be inspections in terms of the facilities where they're being kept.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But are there going to be inspections regarding public health issues, such as checking that the animals that are there aren't carrying some kind of disease or other kinds of airborne pathogens that might infect other animals? And then we have a crisis in our hands.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So is there a a an item in there that addresses the public health concerns that that this is this may arise?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor, did you want to add to that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I wanted to I wanted to thank the councilmember for raising that issue. I failed to make in my remarks when discussing staff and and their enforcement that public health aspect, just as we would with whether it's a dog owner or a cat owner, that is part of the inspection.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have Mr. Nelson Cur here, city manager, is that correct, as well as Ted Stevens?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To answer the specifics of that question and Mr. Mayor, if I may also add one more thing, which there is the setback slide. If staff could also address after answering Councilmember your longest question, which I think also speaks to your earlier comment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This looks like it's easy to accomplish in terms of setbacks. And if you could articulate how very difficult it is to find many, many properties that would actually qualify under certain setbacks, 35 feet doesn't sound like a lot, or 50 feet doesn't sound like a lot, but it really is when we're talking about setbacks from other properties'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and if staff could work that into their response, I'd appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, it's like I said, they're airborne pathogens. They're going to it's going to happen or they do happen. I agree with the setbacks. I mean, I have no issue with that. I the the the threshold for people to meet these requirements is is very high.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can see that still, there's the concerns about noise due to concerns about the the the possibilities of one or two animals getting contracted to something and then taking it elsewhere. And then might while we wait for staff or staff's going to respond to it, you know, there's waste that comes with this and there's a concern, you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know, there's there's there there might be some biohazards as a result of having these animals. I mean, there's waste that's created from that. Is there a disposal concern there in terms of how we get rid of goat waste and chicken waste and those types of other ways that that would be caused by having, you know, animals or'",
        "'speaker_9': 'these kinds of farm animals in in neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can I can go ahead and answer part of that mentioned the silver to answer the the larger part of the question. Maybe our animal care team can can weigh in just to address one piece of that. I think that from the it's my understanding that there this would work very there'd be very similar inspection process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In fact, I think more stringent in this case as to how the animals would be permitted, particularly if you have larger amounts for they would go through an inspection process. The county does that with there's a process for bees in the county of Los Angeles, and we would have something similar here for whether it was goats or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'whether it was chickens. It's my understanding, too, that from a waste perspective, these animals actually produce usually less, less toxic and less damaging waste than would in our dogs and cats that we have. And certainly from a. And so certainly I think from a waste perspective, I think that's also that could be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But those are about very valid concerns. I want to make sure that staff answers the councilmembers larger question about that, things about inspections and waste and. Theft.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Who wants to go first?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, for as far as the animal care services, the health aspect of it would really wouldn't be something that we would enforce on our own. We would be more concerned about the setbacks. And I think the way we did the setbacks were the more animals you had, the more potential impact.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's why we increased the setbacks, especially for, like, the chickens. And so if you just wanted to have a handful of chickens, we wanted to make it easy for people to have a small number of chickens, assuming with the assumption that there'd be less impact, less issues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then if you wanted to have larger numbers of chickens, we would require the inspection. And during our inspection we would be checking mostly the shelter, making sure that the shelters adequate, making sure that the enclosure is adequate, making sure that there's enough land, permeable land and enough setback.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've Nelson can talk about the health issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's there's basic sanitation issues that are in the ordinance. If they if they comply with the ordinance, I think we're going to avoid most of the problems. Having said that, your health department routinely tracks on any types of diseases that may be impacting food or may be impacting animals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the health officer has broad authority under state law to address those issues. So if we need to address those issues, we could address those. But we have not seen that issue here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you for that response. Also, there was an item in there saying that it's for personal use. Is there something that you know, in case there we have these owners that want to sell their product or want to share their product with neighbors or anyone else and perhaps taking their products to a farmer's market, for example'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Is there any item in there enforcement about that appearance of taking their products to market? We were sharing it in a restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. The the ordinance that was proposed did have a requirement that the goat's milk or anything produced from the goats was for personal consumption only. But that was limited to the goat section. There was there was no restriction on the honey or the eggs from the chickens.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And I have one more one more item that I want to add. You know, just like we have with rabbits, you know, all the time around Easter, we have a of an overflow of rabbits that people take home to the kids.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They find out they're are too expensive to to support. And then they end up being abandoned, i.e. Lonely City College with their rabbit rabbits. Or they they take them back to the to the animal shelter. Is there going to be an additional cost or additional cages that might be needed to to support the influx of, let's say'",
        "'speaker_9': ', an overpopulation of goats where a an owner might have over bred goats or chickens or whatever other animal that might be out there. Are we prepared? Do we have a plan?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What? We. We haven't had any issues with any goats coming in. Not. Not yet. We do have resources. We do have some rescues that we work with now. We do get we get a handful of chickens and roosters every year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Not a lot. It's it's around in like the thirties or forties a year now. And we have no trouble getting those replaced in in farms, in areas out in the Inland Empire and areas like that. So we have resources for what we have coming in now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I imagine if we had some goats come in, we could probably call on those resources for that as well. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's all ahead. Mary, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Oh, council member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Urunga. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make clear regarding the goats and the products from the goats, the milk and the cheese is strictly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Prohibited from being distributed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Outside of the home or outside of the personal use. They are it's clear that they are not to distribute that, whether giving it away, selling.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It at a farmers market.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or any of the above. So that's that was our concern and that's in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I believe that one of the amendments by the vice mayor added that chicken products would be prohibited except for personal consumption. So the way I understand that amendment, it would read similar to the amendment for the gold products that you would not be allowed to sell it, donated or otherwise distributed to any other person'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I have a few questions as well to staff or is somebody able to provide any sort of background on the historical justification that was provided for the north of Anaheim language? How did that come to be?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Council councilman super not is willing to offer a historical perspective if staff isn't prepared for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure, Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Larry Rich will be here for that one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By the way, when you get called to do a historical perspective, it doesn't mean you're old and knowledgeable.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Mayor Members of the City Council. I was actually we were all very curious about that Anaheim boundary, and I did some research on it and found that that boundary changed over time. About 100 years ago, it was actually at Fourth Street, and then it went to Seventh Street and then to Anaheim.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And this is for different animals, but chickens. The the boundary dropped, but for goats it was retained. So we think that it was a means of estimating the more urbanized areas of the city. So it's kind of an old figure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I guess that's what I'm curious about. Is there something about goats that are unique to this? Urban agriculture that makes that would justify. Some sort of separate treatment based on geographic location. Is it a noise issue? Is it a waste issue?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is what what what would it be about goats?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I feel like in the past it was considered more of a straight farm type animal and needed to be outside of the more urbanized areas. But that perception has changed, particularly with the keeping a miniature goats, which you know are the size of a small dog.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so I think miniature goats didn't really exist in the city 50 or 100 years ago when when, you know, those perceptions were dominant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In regards to the to the setbacks. I know Vice Mayor Lowenthal touched on that briefly, and I think staff was attempting to are there different areas of the city where we think the setback, limitation or regulation would make it difficult for folks to engage in urban agriculture?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For example, in some parts of the city, it's very densely populated, like in Belmont Shore. I can't imagine that we would have a property. It would be very rare to see a property that would have the sufficient setback because it's from the coop to the residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The adjacent residents, correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. Or the actual enclosure, the. And the coop.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And so have you done any sort of analysis to see whether or not there are parts of the city that lend themselves more to the space that would be required to have urban agriculture with these setbacks in mind?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So Councilmember, I did that sort of research using the city's G.I.s early on in this process. And it's true, and it's what you would expect that, you know, small areas of the city with smaller lot sizes, for example, Belmont Shore and Naples are much, much in larger built out houses, leave much less area remaining on that lot'",
        "'speaker_14': 'to make these situations allowable. So in truth, there will still be cities where it'll be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the distance requirements. But I think the feeling was the 50 foot distance for chickens across the board that exists makes it difficult to keep chickens almost anywhere in the city except for where there are larger lots'",
        "'speaker_14': '. So we were trying to level that a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there any sort of analysis that's been done in regards to the range of property that an individual would have to have in order to allow the operation of either the goats or the chickens with the setback requirements like the number of square feet that would be required as far as yard space.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Sure. The the minimum requirement for an for the enclosure of ten feet per ten square feet per chicken. That's an easy calculation to make then. So, you know, for to keep four chickens, you would need 40 square feet of enclosure.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So, you know, whatever those dimensions are, they may or may not fit in your yard within those setback areas. And so obviously a larger number of chickens, in addition to the required setbacks, also require a larger enclosure area.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so, you know, there's a balance in there that needs to be met.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the setback requirement changes based on the number of the animal. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Correct. So there's a three set back distances based on the three, you know, 1 to 4 or 5 to 10 or 11 to 20. Okay. But then there's an additional sort of floating calculation based on the maximum number of chickens you could keep in your enclosure based on that ten square feet per chicken.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. In regards to the question that Councilman Urunga raised, which I think is a really good one, do we have any sort of legal definition for personal consumption? And you know what? What are our concerns, if any, that, for example, if one were to consume it in the home and offer it to a guest, let's say, and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it was contaminated or something was wrong with it. What what sort of safeguards do we have? I mean, is the legislative intent behind this that personal consumption is limited to the owner of the animal and or his his or her immediate family members.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or vice mayor members of the council. The the current prohibition allows for food product produced by live goats shall be for personal consumption only by members of the Permittees household. So if you had guests that's clearly covered under this it's it's meant to prohibit distribution of the product in this case from the goats and or now the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'chickens to you can't sell it. You can't give it away, you can't donate it or any other use for it except at home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's no proposed change to that. Then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As the only proposed changes, the addition of chickens to the prohibition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I want to talk about bees. Again, I'm sure staff has done the research and you're the experts on this. This is really unchartered territory for me. So I'm looking for some education here. The the biggest. One of the biggest.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Set of emails or email categories that our office has received over the last week has been a fear of bee stings. Can you talk to that at all in regards to a hive being in an adjacent property? I'm sure there's all sorts of research and and data that talks about bee patterns and their flight patterns and such'",
        "'speaker_14': '. Councilmember. So I looked into this quite a bit early on as well. And so the first thing to understand is that the bees are already out there, meaning our city is full of both wild hives and domestic hives.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And bees visit any property that has flowers where, you know, so whether or not your neighbor has a bee hive, if you've got things the bees went, they'll be on your property. So having a bee hive next door doesn't necessarily increase the chance of a negative interaction with bees, particularly if you're following the guidelines that are set'",
        "'speaker_14': 'as part of the ordinance language that directs their flight away from the nearest property line.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. In terms of the can you explain to me the justification for the height requirement of the bee hives? What's the scientific purpose for that? Do they not fly down or.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Well, so the original the existing ordinance that talks about beehives needing to be ten feet above the ground. That was initially a little bit of a mystery about why that would be the case. But we think that it was because since bees have a pretty lengthy range for the size of insect that they are, they can go'",
        "'speaker_14': '2 to 3 miles away from their hive to to get what they need in terms of forage. They fly up and fly a far distance at a higher altitude. So the idea is to get them to, immediately upon leaving the hive, fly at least six feet above ground, and then they don't come back down again until they're'",
        "'speaker_14': 'at the place where they want to forage. So that keeps, you know, bee interactions with people at a minimum because they're, you know, start off at a higher altitude, if that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in some ways that would provide a safeguard to the adjacent property because they're probably not going to exit the hive and take a nosedive down.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What other cities are you aware of in the region that have this type of ordinance? And are any of the ordinances in nearby cities comparable to ours in terms of setbacks and number of animals, etc.?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So we did a lot of that research, too, although it's a couple of years old at this point. There's a little bit of everything out there. There's very permissive cities. There's very restrictive cities. Long Beach kind of fell even with its existing rules kind of in the middle.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But some recent some examples that immediately come to mind is the city of Los Angeles actually allows a number, unlimited number of chickens with only a 20 foot setback from the neighboring home, which was really surprising and even to the point that Los Angeles, the city of Los Angeles, by right, allows one rooster per lot, which is'",
        "'speaker_14': 'not even part of our roosters, are prohibited in Long Beach now and would continue to be so. So that's an example of a nearby city, a very large city that has very, you know, relaxed chicken keeping rules, you know, and it varies from these different three animals are in the bees where, you know, many cities just outright'",
        "'speaker_14': 'prohibit. Bees are silent on them. There's been some recent efforts by other neighboring cities, Santa monica being one of them. And actually the city of Los Angeles just recently has legalized bees, if you will, or that's going through that process.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So at various cities, at various points in the last four years, a lot of relaxations of these rules have occurred. One of the ones that we looked at most closely and was most recent was the City of San Diego.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That actually a lot of our proposed ordinance language is drawn from what happened, what was enacted in the city of San Diego in 2012. And I recently checked in with them just to see if they made any changes to it, what they'd enacted based on issues.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And they said they hadn't, that things are pretty quiet out there in terms of there being problems or enforcement problems.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In regards to the costs associated with enforcement, if any, to staff, feel pretty confident that given the amount that is going to be charged for registration of the animals, that staff can recover whatever enforcement costs that it would need in order to enforce any against any complaints or allegations of of misuse of this ordinance by a neighbor'",
        "'speaker_5': 'against another neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. I mean, we we currently and have always got in a very, very, very small percentage of calls for complaints for chickens, roosters, not very small. Number four, goats, two or three and very even less for bees. And most of those complaints are related to roosters which are illegal and will continue to be illegal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't I don't foresee, you know, our complaints rising to a significant level that would impact our operations significantly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And just out of curiosity, if if you do get a call from a complaining party regarding a rooster, what would you do if you went to the location and found a rooster?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, what we do now is we will make contact with the animal owner, let them know that it's illegal, and then we generally give them a set amount of time to rehome the rooster, or if they need assistance, we can assist them with that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But generally they got it from somewhere or they have somewhere to take it. We haven't had any issues with having to impound a bunch of these roosters generally that people are able to find a new home for it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then just going back to the north of Anaheim. Language that we it seems a little bit mysterious, a distaff feel that there's any. Based on the research that you've done, any sort of justification that would warrant maintaining that limitation to north of Anaheim?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In terms of goats specifically.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I didn't see when it was kind of a broad brush way of, just like I said, thinking that this portion of the city was a more urban area where farming activities was no longer appropriate. And we felt that it was arbitrary and that the more specific distance requirements covered the the true variety of different lot sizes and'",
        "'speaker_14': 'levels of urbanization that actually do exist south of Anaheim. So, you know, it's not as urban and homogeneous as, you know, it's completely apartment buildings. There's a lot of variation. So places that can meet the distance requirements that are south of Anaheim should be allowed to keep those animals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now into another complaint or concern that we've received from residents and again, it's I worked at Isabel Patterson Child Development Center. I was a preschool teacher there back in the day, and we had goats. And I don't recall specifically other than the fact that they would eat our clothes while we were standing there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't recall anything specific regarding the waste or the the sounds that the goats made. But some of the concerns that we've gotten from residents over the last few days has been the concern that goats are louder than chickens, for example, or that their waste is potentially harmful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Know.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'My understanding of goat waste is that it is less likely to have odor since goats are vegetarians, you know, they eat everything, but they are not likely to eat meat. And so and their waste is directly able to be used as fertilizer.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Same thing with chickens, you know, you put it in the compost. And so it's not something that needs to be thrown away. That could be an odor issue as long as it's not piling up and staying in one spot, which is something that good animal keeping practices would would prevent and address in terms of goats being louder'",
        "'speaker_14': 'than other animals. You know, I just want to share something from personal experience, which is in the neighborhood that I moved into in Los Altos. I would hear a sound at night that I wondered if it was a goat.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I tracked it down over the course of weeks. And it was turned out it was someone's cockatoo in a house for houses down. And it was making this very sort of goat like sound. And so, I don't know, that was an accepted thing in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I don't think that goats are any louder than that, which is something that apparently is allowed and it was actually in someone's home as opposed to, you know, in their yard. So, you know, there's videos that are out there about screaming goats and all this sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I don't think that a pair of goats, which is very intentional in these rules. And we drew this from the city of San Diego. Goats are social animals, so they they want to have a buddy with them. And that helps calm them and keeping, you know, keeps them from needing to to make noise.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I don't believe that they're any louder than a dog barking would be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that might just be a myth. Regarding I mean.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The myth that that goats are louder. I believe so, yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In regards to can you explain to me a little bit and I think the vice mayor made a friendly that involved the horning or de horning. Could you explain that a little bit to me and educate me a little bit on what that is and what does that do to the goat?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Meaning the previous requirement to de horn?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I think that that was a pretty common goat keeping practice, particularly when you have more than one goat or you have goat interactions with other animals or kids, that goat horns can be potentially dangerous if they bite you with their horns.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so but there's a other side of that story, which is that Dee Horning is inhumane to the animal and unnecessary. And so, you know, while it had been a common practice in the past, it's, I think felt now that it's less necessary and it puts supposedly the owner of the goat at a little bit of risk'",
        "'speaker_14': 'that some injury could occur. And it puts more onus on them to keep careful track of their goats and what they're doing and who they might be butting. But again, it's a personal responsibility thing and it doesn't prohibit people from Dee Horning at their option.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It just doesn't require them to do so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so the amendment is to not require. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, Councilmember Price, I would like to just point out that this ordinance doesn't necessarily cancel out the noise ordinance, which the health department we administer that that program, and we would respond to any.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Excessive noise complaints and do an analysis on that and address those complaints still.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And you do a fantastic job of that in all other areas. So I appreciate that. I know our district calls upon you often. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I'm just I'm a bit biased on this particular item for a number of reasons. I spent a number of years in my childhood in Alabama, and it was either adjacent to a farm or on a farm.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I remember spending time clearing fields for uncles or or helping to tend to cattle. And I can tell you there are tremendous educational benefits from living with nontraditional animals in the urban area. You can learn about, you know, how a egg turns into a chicken or so on and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There are. But at the same time, I've also lived in sort of urban areas that it may be untraditional to have a garden. But I got to tell you, many people in apartment complexes, they wish they could they'd have the availability to actually have a garden.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We've always found areas to plant something, whether it's a windowsill or a front yard patch, a patch of a lawn. We just figured out how to do it. So for me, this issue, it's about health and equity. I think all citizens deserve the right to choose what they want to eat and to develop that food themselves.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I asked I asked my mom about this issue. And the first thing she said, I said, How do you think I should vote on this? So I supported issue, oppose it. She said, Well, what we buy in the stores is killing us.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So you need to support.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It as it was pretty.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Pretty, pretty straightforward. But that doesn't that doesn't particularly mean there aren't there aren't like legitimate concerns. Like when my neighbor complains to me that my dogs barking too much, I take steps to make sure that my dog is more quiet.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If I know that a car driving down the alley disturbs my dog, I bring my dog in at night so they don't disturb neighbors. That's my personal responsibility. And I can tell you, I've you know, my family's had chickens, aunts, grandmothers have ate chickens.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I can tell you, they're no louder than a dog, a chicken. Roosters. However, in North Long Beach, we do have our roosters. And we call we call noise abatement and code enforcement. We make and we we handle that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I don't think that that issue is going to go away. Roosters in the community, we know how to address it. There are properties that are former ranch properties in the area that still have horses and we've learned how to adapt and how to address it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There is there are a couple of questions that I might have. So I know that last time this came up, there were significant questions and concerns that the council expressed and they weren't able to find consensus and move forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I want to I want to know, like, has staff addressed those major concerns that the council brought up the last time this brought forward? Or are we simply because I wasn't on the council last time I was a staff person, but I don't quite know if we what measures we intentionally had taken to to improve those issues'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that were were addressed in terms of like noise abatement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, Councilmember Richardson. I think both all three staff members can address that. The concerns that were raised are ones that we're discussing right now. And I think what we have been able to do is through the staff's research and also commitment to code enforcement and reinforcement of existing municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've done a better job of instilling confidence in why this is the right evolution of this ordinance for our city today, which I don't know that we did such a great job in 2011. And then certainly when Council member Supernova was on on the on the Sustainability Commission, we learn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think what through Larry and Ted and Nelson's efforts, we were able to provide the assurance, as I said, that this because this is no different from any other animal that we would allow residents to have. Our enforcement would be no different in our expectations would be the same.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And some of the other issues that came up were more fear based. And I think we've we've discussed that today. Larry, Mr. Rich pointed to the fact that whether there's a beehive next door or not, there are bees abundant in in our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thankfully so. Thankfully so. And that's why we have such an amazing landscape of flora and fauna. And and so I think we're doing a better job at sharing with the reality of life in our urban center is and it does include all of these amazing animals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if if Mr. Rich would like to address that as well, if there's anything specific that came up or even the city attorney that we may have adjusted with this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I would just say I would agree that raising perception levels and putting more information out there was helpful because, you know, as staff people deeply researching this item, we felt like we were coming up with good policy that balanced everything.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But upon hearing this stuff for the first time, you don't. It takes you a while to get there. So just having more opportunity to consider this and hear from constituents that are knowledgeable on these topics, I think helps.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. That makes me a lot more comfortable supporting this. On another issue that that I'd like to just get some clarity on. So there's a story in my family about the pig pit, pig, blueberry and blueberry. My mom and her her brother would play with blueberry.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And in one one, one day they came home and blueberry was for dinner. So. So. So my question is, what is our process for consuming our backyard animals, the chickens and particularly the goats? What is our specific steps that are in this ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Mayor, may I not and I'm so sorry for its loss, but that can be very traumatic. And so what I wanted to ask the city attorney, which I didn't during my comments and Mr. Mayor, if you'll allow me, can we as we do in other ordinances, we refer to existing code that we have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So can we refer it within our ordinance, make a reference to backyard slaughtering and all those things that we have in place today. We have those things in place today. And a new ordinance is. There's nothing wrong with reminding us of that within this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that true, Mr. City Attorney That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The problem becomes then if you change in one section and you miss it in the other, you create some confusion and the municipal code goes out of date. But as you stated, currently backyard slaughtering is prohibited except in areas where it's properly zoned and that's under 8.28.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And roosters are prohibited in a different section in municipal code 6.20.050.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it's prohibited no backyard slot. Just to be clear, there's no backyard slaughtering. And then my final question is when if we were to adopt this tonight, when with this go into effect?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff. The mayor members of council councilmen Richard. And the the motion tonight is to request the city attorney to come back within 30 days with an ordinance. So then you would come back, you'd have a first reading, a second reading, and then 31 days after it's signed by the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The ordinance would go into effect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next, we have Councilor Austin.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. And I'm really looking forward to hearing from the public to. We were and thank thank you all for answering most of my questions that I have or asking them. I want to thank most of the urban ag advocates who are here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, the the the council did not agree two years ago when this came before before us. I raise a lot of significant concerns, a lot of significant concerns that were or they have been addressed here today. And I asked the urban ag advocates, I said.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The issue wasn't necessarily convincing the council at the time. It was convincing your neighbors and to to the beekeepers out there to Long Beach Fresh. To my good friend Kelly Johnson in the urban farm stand. I want to thank you all, because you have actually I've seen it over the last couple of years have been extremely active'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and engaged in at our Carlitos Green growing experience and First Fridays and many other events. You've been out there talking to the public, educating the public, and I can honestly say that the the response that I received prior to this issue coming before this council tonight has been mostly positive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I credit the ah advocates who are out here today. So thank you. I'm inclined to support this. I do still have concerns about our goats. I got to tell you, I'm not quite there yet. I'll tell you, I'm like Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I didn't grow up in the South, but I grew up in Detroit and most of our folks came from the South and we gardened. Everybody had grow their own greens, their own corn, their own squash and whatever else that we could, we could grow in our backyards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was comment. My grandfather had a hat a lot full of garden, four foot with a full garden next door to him. And so that I think we need to get back to as a as a as a society, it makes us a lot healthier.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm really concerned and I'm always concerned with our ability to enforce things. And so I do have a few questions for staff regarding the penalties for not following the ordinance. For example, what would be the penalty for not neutering your goat or not microchipping your goat or for backyard slaughtering?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Still the mayor and council members. The the penalties would be the same as we are now. And we would. Go more towards education and getting them in compliance. So, you know, getting them getting the go microchipped, getting them in compliance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Otherwise the enforcement would be the same for anything in Title six, which, you know, $100, 200, $200 and $500. So we have the citation process, but obviously our goal would be education and just compliance. And of course, I'm not advocating to penalize anyone in our society but or our city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But if these these these laws are enacted, I would certainly hope there was there would be some some. So meaningful enforcement if necessary. It also states that that there is no running at large or no goats should be held in the front yards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that correct? Yes, that is correct. And the microchipping will help. That's why we wanted the microchip, because if the goat did get out and an animal control officer had to impound it, we would be able to scan it and get it back to the owner right away instead of bringing it back to the shelter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So hypothetically, if you found a goat running at large without a microchip, what would be the process? We would bring it back to our shelter, hold it for the couple of days that we would have to hold it and then we would find it at home.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We probably a rescue or a farm would reach out to our resources that we have. Okay. And where would would one go to microchip? A goat? Is that a local veterinarian? They could probably have a done a veterinarian.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They could do it at one of our vaccination clinics where we do microchipping. We could even offer it in at our at our shelter. Have we had any experience with microchipping a goats? I haven't, but I'm sure our veterinarians at our vets have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Just I have to ask these questions. It's important. And I do see this as this this whole issue of urban ag and this ordinance as a as a property rights or or an issue of expanding property rights for for our residents.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I look forward to hearing from our public. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. I have a few more speakers and we're going to go to the public and take a vote. Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that this has gone through a few iterations and here we are now. It's a really good, healthy discussion I think, that we're having. I will be supporting this item. Of course I'm on the item. I think I want to thank Vice Mayor Lowenthal for her for her diligence in this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know she's gone through this quite a few years, as well as Councilmember Supernova, who has gone through the process as well. And I will say to the urban agriculture advocates, it's been really great learning from you. Many of you are very educated in this far more than.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think many of us will be here in the council. And so I thank you for all of your information, your emails, your outreach to your neighbors to ensure that this is a good ordinance for all of us and that it makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I certainly see this in many different areas. I see this in health and environment. As many of my council colleagues discuss. It is an option for our residents to have healthier food choices, especially in low income, high dense neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Much of what I represent in the First District, education for families, but also for the owners to ensure that owners know the proper usage of the proper care for their animals, as well as the penalties and fines should they do something that is incorrect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But for families as well to know that this is an option that is available. But what are what are the nuances of the ordinance? And then lastly, animal rights, of course, and owner responsibility, as I mentioned. So I again want to thank Vice Mayor Lowenthal for including a reference to slaughtering, because I think that's really important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know it's been discussed many times and so I just will will certainly support this and I think everyone for being here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Back to Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And I appreciate the patience of the audience. I'm sure you guys all know this, that many of you are in here and you're experts in this field, and that's wonderful. But we have a lot of residents who don't know much about this, and there's a lot of conclusions that people make that are misplaced.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So sometimes we're asking questions that seem really super obvious to you, but we're doing it because tomorrow we're going to get calls. And some people might tune into the meeting tonight and reporters might write things and they'll say things like Goats don't make more noise than other animals because we ask the question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I know it's a little bit, you know, frustrating because you guys know the answers, but you're here because you care about the item. There's a lot of people here who just make conclusions about it and they're not here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So please thank you for your patience and indulging us. On that note, one of the concerns that we've received in our office, because coyotes have been a major issue in our district, is that urban agriculture is going to encourage or attract coyotes to residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So has staff looked at that? And is there anything you can do to address that issue in terms of any data or analysis that you've done?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry. That was a doozy. I know.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Well, I can start off just by saying that it is a concern that these animals need to be protected from predators. And that's built into the ordinance language that the enclosures need to be predator proof. So, you know, there's separate discussions about what attracts coyotes to neighborhoods and, you know, has a lot to do with pet food'",
        "'speaker_14': 'being left out, pets being left out overnight, fallen fruit, all sorts of things that are already bringing them into neighborhoods. And we believe that a properly secured pen for goats or chickens isn't going to create an additional issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's the key there, that we have a properly secured area for these animals to to be.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I might add to that that it's not just coyotes that are predators for these animals, in particular chickens. It's all of the other sort of urban wildlife. Raccoons, possums, skunks. So it's it's vital. Otherwise, you will lose your chickens.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thanks for indulging me by answering all those questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go to public comment, but I want to make a few comments and we're going to go to the public and then go for a vote. I want to just first say that I'm a big, strong supporter of the ordinance in front of us today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm a big supporter of urban agriculture. I always have been voted for it when I was on the council. I talked about it at my state of the city as an important piece of food security, access to healthy foods, access for people that want to have a sustainable city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you look at all the large cities that are really doing the right thing when it comes to sustainability, whether it's Austin, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York, Oakland, Saint Paul, Portland, Seattle, they all have one thing in common.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have strong support for urban AG. And I think that what I love seeing in our community is the dozens of community gardens, the urban farms, the the agriculture that's happening. And I think this is really one really nice step that we're taking forward to support what is a very reasonable ordinance, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank all of the urban ag advocates because this would not be happening today if it wasn't for all of you. I have to particularly thank Donna and Long Beach and Long Beach Groves. I see her in the audience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, you've been doing this as you know. You you have been a consistent advocate for this from day one. Back when I was running for city council, you were talking about it. And I just want to thank you for never letting up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, I know this is a big night for you. And I also want to thank all the other the farm owners and the supporters of of local growing of sharing food. You make our city a better place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm really proud of of what this is. Where this we're at tonight with this. And I also want to thank everyone. It was a big thank you to Vice Mayor Lowenthal for being consistent and thorough and bringing this back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to thank her for for that as well. So thank you all. Thank you for all the supporters. And we'll do public comment. I'm very excited about this. This week's.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Hi there. I'm Gabrielle Weeks. I'm actually a second district resident, but I have spoken to many of you guys over the last few years about this issue. The Sierra Club supports it. We ask for your yes vote. We've heard a lot of good questions, a lot of great answers from staff.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'You guys are just like right there with the answers. So we know exactly what we're voting on and what will happen. The one thing I didn't hear brought up was the price of a goat. The cheapest goat that we were able to find recently looking around online is like $325.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So people are going to keep track of their property. They're not going I mean, look at me. I'm carrying my laptop around because I don't want to lose that. So people aren't going to have like goats wandering the streets riding the city bus, although I found an adorable meme of a goat on a city bus.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So but I ask for your yes vote. And thank you for all your support from from those of you that I've been talking to about this for years and staff that's done such a great job. Larry's got so many good answers to guide you guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Gabrielle. Next, speaker plate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor John, Commerce City Council. I just have a few questions. Where can you buy a goat in chicken? Do they have, like, stores you can go to or I mean, you can. I just want to make sure that we don't have, like, goat puppy mills or puppy mills for chickens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there's regulations on the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely, there's regulations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can. Another question I have I mean, obviously, it's going to be an extra enforcement for animal control and staff. Have we thought about staff time adding additional bodies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's been addressed know in the staff report but their staff doesn't believe there's going to be a major impact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, sir. And also one additional thing has animal control has been trained on how to lasso a goat if it gets out. I mean, I would like to make sure that we have some training on how to capture goat if it does get out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one additional thing I just want to point out, we spent an hour and 15 minutes on goats, chickens and bees and only 3 minutes on our city employees. Have a great night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A couple of years ago, I think there was a federal law, federal law, federal bill called the Food Safety Act. And under under this federal ordinance, a person can't even give tomatoes away from his from his garden to his neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he definitely can't sell them. He can't even give them away. And so and so that that information needs to be on your website, above the forward. You know it a very. You know, very, very obvious, you know, remind people of the federal law and where they can get their chickens microchipped and all that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and esteemed members of the council. My name is Demetrius and I'm a local resident of District two. I'm also the owner of Long Beach Farms, a decentralized urban farm here in Long Beach, with gardens across the city in council districts five, six, eight and growing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I also speak tonight on behalf of Long Beach Fresh, which is the local chapter of the California Food Policy Council. I'd like to express full support of the proposed amendments to Title six of the city's municipal code regarding urban agriculture, with the exception of the new amendment restricting owners ability to share or sell chicken products in a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'robust urban agricultural environment. The person with the chickens should be able to trade with the beekeeper, and that person should also be able to perhaps trade with the local farmer. I think that amendment seems a little arbitrary to my reading and unnecessary.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We at Long Beach Farms believe in food sovereignty and the right of consumers to participate in their own food production, either by growing their own food or connecting directly with those who do. Through our partnerships with the Long Beach Alliance for Food and Fitness, Long Beach Fresh and other nonprofit and corporate groups, we aim to support neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_11': 'most impacted by the lack of healthy food access, namely central, west and north Long Beach. As the Council asserted, urban agriculture helps to create sustainability in cities. It also reconnects individuals to their food and mitigates negative effects of urbanization on the environment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Urban agriculture provides local, healthier food choices, creates jobs, and allows us to grow food where the people are passing these amendments will further increase access to healthy, affordable food for Long Beach residents. I believe the amendments are generally well-crafted, with reasonable requirements regarding set back distance from dwellings and quantity limitations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Likewise, I believe that local innovation, social enterprise and promotion alongside meaningful policy changes are all necessary to bring about better access to fresh, healthy and culturally appropriate foods. Personally and professionally, I'm excited about the potential impacts of this policy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For one, it lowers the barrier of entry into the local food economy by promoting local residents right to grow their own food. In this case, we're talking about high value protein sources. And honey, as many as any who have been to supermarkets or farmer's markets know there is a premium charge for clean and trusted sources of eggs'",
        "'speaker_11': ', milk and pure non contaminated honey. And. You know, I'll jump ahead on my comments for the time running out. I feel that if we're to grow and raise more of our own food here in Long Beach, we must foster a healthy respect for what we are eating and appreciate the effort it takes to grow it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are informed in a way that can lead to better food choices in our community. To paraphrase. To paraphrase the great Maya Angelou. When we know better, we do better. This ordinance is based on our collective knowledge of the myriad benefits of local urban agricultural systems and expands our ability to learn more by doing more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Passage of this amendment will allow us to know better and do better. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And thank you. Long Beach Fresh guys are doing some great stuff. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Hello. My name is Rebecca Bishop and thank you for your interest in this matter. I live in the third district. My kids go to school, primary school in the third district. I work as a professor of mathematics at CSU will be in the third district.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'True to my profession, I'm going to look at this quite logically. I wanted to discuss Mr. Jenkins issues with waste, overpopulation, noise, that type of thing. Mostly, firstly, waste. You go to those and you can buy chicken manure for $4 a square foot per cubic foot.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Sorry, people actually pay for chicken manure. It's actually more expensive than cow manure and it claims to have ten times as much nutritional value as cow manure does. You certainly wouldn't go into Lowe's and buy a sack of dog manure or cat manure.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So you're actually getting something beneficial out of the back end of your chicken that doesn't normally come out of your dog or cat. I also venture to guess that the same people who are going to raise chickens are the same people that have compost bins.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I'm going to put it in the compost bean, which is a glorified recycling bin, which will limit the amount of waste that actually goes out into the city yard for that. Secondly, my basic biology class, this kind of taught me, even though that's not my major, that we're going to have very little issues with overpopulation if'",
        "'speaker_13': 'we actually follow the guidelines set by it. No roosters means no unexpected chicks. And contrary to popular belief, hens lay eggs that are edible with or without a rooster on campus. Also, neutering of male goats will lead to no baby goats.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right. So I don't think there's going to be that type of issue going on. Noise issues, chickens actually put themselves away at dark and they make zero noise to the night as opposed to like a dog. And you can think of the 4th of July coming up.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right. So from that, there's little sound actually coming out at dark from a chicken. There's little bits of sound coming out when they're laying their egg in the daytime, but that's pretty minimal. Yeah. As an educator and a parent.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I absolutely agree with Dr. Lowenthal statement. That this is an opportunity to get closer to and introduce my children to the true cycle of food. The chickens will eat the plants from my garden. The chickens will produce a simple food.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They will also produce the manure that gives me a richer soil, that gives me fewer pests in my garden. Therefore, I have to use less chemicals in my garden. The bees will pollinate my garden and will make actually more food for my chickens to turn around and eat again.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you very much for your yes vote on this. I'm now going to release the microphone to Henry from the Long Beach Beekeepers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, that's great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Hi, I'm Henry Kurland. I'm a beekeeper. I'm also president of the Long Beach Beekeepers Club. We have about 140 members, about half of which live in Long Beach. A good proportion of them already have hives. I brought with me a copy of the ordinance that the city of L.A. passed.'",
        "'speaker_3': '3 to 4 weeks ago permitting buyers in urban areas on. Home. Lot's five foot setback, not the ten foot we're talking about here. I also point out that since October, with help of Larry, we've maintained hives over here in the Civic Center.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know if you're aware of it. We have two hives here currently. In fact, I brought samples of your honey with me, and I have enough jars for the council members, if you're interested. These bees are very gentle, but they're from feral hives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our club, a lot of our members to be rescues. We take bees from where they're not wanted and where they've been a nuisance. And we put them where they are wanted in a managed environment. So I encourage you, at least for the B part.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm also a chicken owner, not a goat owner, but chicken owner. And I encourage you to pass these amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for all the education you do. All the great public education you do. Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hi. My name is Barbara Sinclair. My information is on file. I'm a resident of the sixth District. But as a proud Rigley member, a resident, I count myself as a resident of both the seventh and the 66th District.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As you can probably tell, I'm here for the bees. I'm a beekeeper. I've been a beekeeper for several years. And I got started because of my interest in the demise of the bees and the crisis that we're having with honey bees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And at one point, I decided if I really feel that way, I need to become more hands on. So with Henry and another person from the club as my mentor, I learned how to rescue bees. And I've been doing that as a volunteer free of charge for many years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And at some point, I decided to be a beekeeper myself. Because a lot of us in Long Beach, our bee bandit, we like to call ourselves. So I am very hopeful that you will pass this this change in the ordinance this evening.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It takes a special kind of person to be a beekeeper. Most of most people think we're crazy, in fact. But what I can tell you about beekeepers, at least the 150 members of the club that Henry and I founded here in Long Beach is that we are responsible, we are knowledgeable, we are generous with our knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We pass information on to everywhere we possibly can. We go to Wrigley barbecue events. We go to first Friday's. We go to third Friday's. We go to the Green Festival. We go everywhere where they will have us. And what we mainly do there is talk to children who start out deathly afraid of bees and end up being'",
        "'speaker_7': 'absolutely fascinated by bees. I would like to speak to two issues. One is, as Henry mentioned, there was a change in the language of this proposal from the five foot setback to a ten foot setback. And I have to tell you that bees don't care about setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One foot would be enough for them. They fly truly. They really do. They fly straight up, straight up and then out over the roofs. If if that stopped even, you know, five prospective beekeepers to be able to keep bees, I would be sad.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I see my time is running out. So I want to talk a little bit about eggs. I haven't bought an egg probably in ten years from a grocery store. I buy my eggs from my friends who have chickens from pop up farms with women who have chickens and sell them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I trade my honey for four eggs. I think it would be a crying shame if that part of the motion passed that they were unable to pass those those along to other people. And with that, I thank you and thank you to staff for all the work and I fully support, as do most of the urban agriculture'",
        "'speaker_7': '. People here are city workers. And I'm sorry you didn't get more time.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Hi. My name's Elliott Gonzales. My information is on file. I'm here to speak in favor of everything that was mentioned. I actually wrote the speech, but everybody covered everything I wrote. So I guess I just want to take a really quick second to think everybody who's worked really hard on this over the years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This started grassroots on the ground several years ago by by a friend of mine, Donna, and her family. And we've seen this go through multiple, multiple meetings on the Sustainability Commission, the Environmental Committee. And so I'm really glad to see so much support on this council and in the community and the public at large in terms of'",

        "'speaker_7': 'What deeply concerns us is does animal care have the budget and staff? To issue the permits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Regulate and enforce the violations of this ordinance. We're afraid that it's a slap on the wrist, the educational approach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, that has value. But we need to have I didn't hear tonight what what are the specific penalties for this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there citations like there is with companion animals? These are all issues that were not addressed properly. Abandonment of companion animals were thoroughly aware of. What makes you think this is not going to happen with farm animals? When people are evicted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They have to move for whatever reason.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They get tired of the animal, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The goats are of special concern to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because of their their needs, their their active, their climbers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The males. Okay. It's good that they.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have to be neutered, but the females have to be impregnated every two years, I understand, in order to provide milk and their offspring can stay on the premises for six months.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What happens after that? This animal is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nurtured. It's like a pet. It's like a puppy or kitten.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's microchipped. But then what happens? It's taken to a dark back alley slaughterhouse somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is somebody regulating where these animals go. Like we require a transfer permit for puppies and kittens.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I dealt with it today in North Long Beach, where 20 cats had been abandoned because a man was evicted. Why is it so different?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why is it going to be so different for these poor farm animals? Is it because they're just farm animals that we're not going to have this special consideration.'",

And I want to thank you all for your hard work on this ordinance. I really appreciate the focus and that it was brought back in front of the city council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And of course, I support it. I've sent a letter out to all of you. I'm sure you've seen it. I think, though, that what I want to talk about this evening is, first of all, that perhaps the chickens and goats and bees should not be looked upon as farm animals.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They are not here for our slaughter. They're not here strictly for our use because of these small plots and these small amount of animals that are being kept there, really more pets. And to say that one pet is more valuable or one pet will be more mistreated than others is not really correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are always people who will mistreat animals and we are not going to stop that by not passing this regulation. The other thing I wanted to say was that I'm currently teaching elementary school children. They're very tiny. I'm in charge of a one acre nature center and garden, and educating them is really important because despite all the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'verbiage about the environment and everything else, these children are still afraid of things. And one of my favorite things that happened this last year was there were two little tiny boys, and they looked at the garden and there was a tomato plant with a picture of a tomato steak that had a picture.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And one of them said to the other, Look, it's tomatoes. And the other little boy says, Well, where are they? And the first little boy says, Oh, they're underground. So there really is a disconnect between what we're telling our children and what they actually experience.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And for them to experience bees in the garden of which there are thousands in my garden and to see chickens and all of that in person and relate to it, whatever we're telling them in words is so important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I encourage you to support this. And thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I'm telling you, it's great. Invite you to come out, check out the chicken condo. Our chickens are spoiled. I heard about a beehive that's close by. We've never been bothered by it again. Don't be swayed by the fear mongering.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Vaccinated, they sell vaccines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That you can have administered. So there are built in protections for that before you even get them to your home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Goats and chickens are not a cheap prospect either. To do it on the cheap, it's usually going to cost you for a handful of hens approximately around.'",
        "'speaker_5': '$500 to get the coop an enclosure built more if you're going to raise them from babies and put all that food into them and things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like that. So this is not going to be an impulse purchase. I think these are not the sexy new pet to have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are companion animals, they're beloved.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I've been scratched by cats. Luckily, I didn't get cat scratch fever or toxoplasmosis, which are serious illnesses, infectious diseases caused by these animals that we allow in the city. Both dogs and cats are carnivores. These other animals that we're talking about, the chickens and goats are, for the most part, herbivores, except for the few bugs that the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'chickens eat. So that makes it makes their waste less harmful, less likely to cause some type of zoonotic illness that can transfer to us. And, you know, I can just personally say that of all the animals, the quietest ones are the goats.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um. Uh, you know, when we swarm, you can hear them, right? So the bees and the goats are the quietest. Um, the chickens make just a tiny bit of sound, just.'",

Many of you might have heard me speak a couple of times before, and I have a lot of experience with this motion because I've been living with my parents who are really supporting it, and I have experience with goats, chickens, bees and a lot of other things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just want to say that. What's better to have something that you just pay for it and it feeds off all the money you give it like a dog. You have to pay for all that and you don't get anything in return but chickens, goats.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And because you get something in return for all the money you put into. And since you have to put in so much money into those animals, why would you abandon it anyways? So it has no question about abandonment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're pets in general, so that's one. And they're really good for family in general. So. I'm pro go and I vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I'm going to go ahead. And after the. The lady in the back, I'm going to cut the speaker's list off. So I think we have three speakers, which I will cut off. Speakers. Let's close, sir.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'I would like to thank the Council for once again revisiting this issue. I would also urge you not to give in to the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fear mongering that fortunately has subsided a bit, and there's only a.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Few voices left in the miseducation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That comes out of their voices.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'About what it is to have. Goats, bees and chickens. First of all, as everybody has pointed out before, the the manure that comes out of both the goats and the chickens can be used in our gardens, which most of us do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But most of us who have these animals also have gardens. I would the only part of the legislation that's being put forward that I don't agree with is the sharing or bartering or trading of eggs. I can understand with the goats and the milk, with the processing that goes involved that there could be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Potential for contamination. However, the egg comes out of the chicken complete in its own little shell. And if we if you were to add that to the legislation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would hate to see the mayor be guilty of illegally accepting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Chickens for his own.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Once again, I would urge you to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, please move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's been three, four years now. I think the wheels of government turned very slowly, but I'm.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And one question that I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Did have for those of us who are grandfathered into this, I have had chickens for eight years. I read in part of the legislation that we're not able to keep them until we have a permit.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Provision for those of us who have been in compliance this whole.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Time and take that into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The law stands now. I am in perfect compliance and I just don't want to feel that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now that this is going to change. Somehow now I have to.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Realize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That there is a lot of care. And to take care of all the animals.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You have to. Be very, very, uh, you know.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Especially.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The goats and the chickens. However, it's great for bees and gardens. And I agree that any I have tomatoes and pots and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's good for gardening.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'They've come out from San Bernardino and stuff and.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They've educated us on keeping the animals healthy and avoiding diseases, avoiding things that they constantly give us updates on things like avian influenza. We were aware that there were problems up in Canada six months ago before it was in the news here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So lots of local chicken keeper enthusiasts were already being very proactive and practicing extra sanitation and biosecurity. We there's lots of education on how to sanitize and make sure you don't bring home something from a different flock. If you go to visit.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'Maybe once a month or so, somebody who's not a member finds our group and posts that they're having to relocate due to work. They have to sell their house because they're being foreclosed on and they will post that they have a flock of chickens that they.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Within a matter of hours, if not.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You know, a couple days, there's more than six or seven people within the group that step forward and post, hey, here's my phone number, here's my email, contact me. These chickens never stay available for more than a few days, so a homeless chicken is very, very rare.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The only ones who might have a hard time finding a home is a rooster. But even then, we have lots of members who live within Los Angeles who would love to get a backyard pet chicken. So the homeless issue with chickens, in my opinion, is nonexistent, especially with groups like ours that educate people.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's that's where I've certainly learned quite a bit in this process. I'd like to especially give my heartfelt, sincere thank you to our city staff. There are a lot of issues they work on many years at a time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is certainly one of them, and it's one where I've witnessed our staff go out and constantly engage the community not to hear the answers that they want to hear, but to really hear the community. And that's it's a very enriching process.'",

And what I'd also like to share, many of you, especially Councilmember Richardson, had offered that he is the child of farmers and farming family, and so am I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, we all find ourselves like migratory birds. We find ourselves in environments that really aren't necessarily inherent to our family heritage. But here we are. And I think what what I heard and was reminded of when Councilmember Richardson spoke is no matter how far away we come from our heritage, whether it's 100 years before us, 1000'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. Good evening. My name is Swimming Chair and I'm an immigration attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. So I'm here to support this resolution for economic and public safety reasons. National and local studies have shown that the DOCA program has had a significant effect on young immigrants ability to increase their earnings and expenditures, which results in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'greater contributions to the tax base. One national study found that almost 60% of DOCA beneficiaries obtain a new job after receiving DOCA and about 45% increase their earnings. This provides direct evidence of the economic boost provided by DOCA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The effect of expanded DOCA and DAPA would be even greater. The estimates vary, but experts agree that even modestly successful enrollment in the DAPA and expanded DOCA programs would add more than 2 billion nationally in taxes over the next two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This money could be spent to improve infrastructure, education or other important local projects. L.A. County is home to an estimated 500,000 residents eligible for DAPA and expanded programs. This is the largest population of eligible residents in any of the nation's counties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These programs will help to lift immigrant families out of poverty and also provide them with the relief of knowing that they no longer have to fear deportation. Furthermore, law enforcement leaders say that darkened DAPA would make our communities safer by taking immigration fears out of local interactions with police.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Major Cities Chief Police Association, which is a professional association of chiefs and sheriffs representing the largest cities in the U.S., the Police Executive Research Forum, and 27 law enforcement leaders in areas ranging from Iowa to Texas signed onto an amicus brief in support of these programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In their brief, they state that deferred action promotes public safety by encouraging immigrants to come to court, to cooperate with law enforcement, and by providing a means to obtain secure and verifiable identification. So finally, I just want to say that we should reject the prejudice, intolerance and xenophobia that some speakers tonight are promoting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would be moving us backwards at a time when we really need to heal from deep racial wounds. Instead, we should be moving forward towards policies of inclusion, justice and equity. Long Beach communities and economy shouldn't have to wait any longer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So before before our next speaker just wanted to show so we have about probably another 40 to 45 minutes of public comment. And so I know I know I have one or two councilmembers that have to also have to be leaving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to make sure that we try to get through. This is a very important issue. I know. So I'm going to cut off the speaker's list at the very end. Who's the last person in line there, Senora?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're going to cut the speaker's list there. I'm closing the speaker's list. And I know that we have a lot of people that are that are obviously supporting the item. So if we can, as best as possible, expedite, you have your right to your 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I understand that. But please, I want to make sure that people are here for for the process. So please continue. And we have the speaker list is now closed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good afternoon. My name is Maria Barrientos. I have been living in Long Beach for 23 years and I wish. Thank. Good afternoon. My name is Maria. Laurie and I have lived in Long Beach for 23 years. And since I came to this country, I'll always pay my taxes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you would support the immigration reform, it would be beneficial for me along with my daughter, since we've always dreamed of having our own beauty salon. And this would be a business that would also help the economy of Long Beach because we would support other people in growing, along with providing a source of work for others.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they would also. If it's possible, I would like you all to support the immigration reform. Thank you very much for listening to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gracias. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'A comprehensive immigration.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Reform awareness and support that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. That's just like to say that there will be no immigration reform coming up. Also, our system is not broke and our immigration laws are just simply not enforced. Secondly, America started as British colonies. We allowed immigration. But that's not what made America great.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What made America great was our Constitution or rule of law. Every illegal alien that comes here is in violation of America's sovereignty and our rule of law. They have brought their criminality across the border. The reason they come here is because their nations are full of crime, because they have no rule of law.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They brought that rule. They did not leave their corruption at the border. They brought their corruption along across that border. I as a legal resident, I as a citizen, a descendant of immigrants, I have the constitutional and civil right to live in a sovereign nation with secure borders.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Every illegal alien that came has violated my civil rights, and they are the enemy of America. And they do not love America. They're just here for the money. It's just greed. If the money wasn't here, they wouldn't be here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is the list of crimes that they want illegal alien criminals not to be deported, but brought back into America. In 1970, we were the eighth largest economy in the world. Half the population, a huge portion of our population.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Stay at home, mom. We didn't have the crime that we have. We didn't have the water shortage that we had. We didn't have the deficit we had. It was a better California than all these illegal aliens have at it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Nothing. All they've done is turn our freeways into parking lots. The all they done is put gang bangers on the streets. We had safe streets until they came. This is the crime and the corruption they brought across the border and laid it here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Why in the world would you want to take felons? Car theft. All. Every. Every minor money laundering. And put these criminals back on the street. It is absolutely insane. This is not a nation of immigrants. This is a nation of legal residents.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is people who love the Constitution. I don't know what you hope to gain here other than put yourselves on our political radar screen. This, this. I'm telling you, this will be the confrontation point of all immigration in the future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This mean if you want this stuff downtown, when people come here on their holidays, go ahead and pass this ball thing and we'll have it. But I don't think people want to come to downtown Long Beach as the legal immigration rallies.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Endlessly and endlessly. And that's what's going to happen. What that what? I have no idea what you're doing. You have brought crime and corruption right in here, and now it's seeping into you. Illegal aliens, they only bring crime.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They add nothing to this society. And if illegal aliens don't have to obey the laws, why should anybody? And we see that. And why do their children grow up to be gangbangers? We didn't have graffiti. We did not have gang banging in 1970.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We were a society of legal residents and we respected the rule of law. You are going to destroy this society. This will not last.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The times have sought to strike you. And we don't need to yell when we're actually making public comment one. And just to correct one fact. California now is actually the seventh largest economy in the world. So it has actually moved up a point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My name is Elliot. Information on file. I'll be brief. I just want to tell a quick story about a friend of mine who is is an immigrant. When he first came into the country, his status was, I think, in question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But eventually he he was a legal immigrant. And I someone who really inspires me because I know we're talking a lot about the effect on the system and the government. And, you know what? Immigrants contribute or don't contribute.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And my friend, actually. Got his doctorate, went to college because of the immigration reform, because people gave him the opportunity. And he's actually now the current mayor of the city of Long Beach. And this December, he actually sent out an email to a lot of people who are supportive of him and followers of him.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'He's quite a patriot, something that we kind of have some disagreement on. I personally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Am a little bitter at.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Some of the issues that has happened in this country. But he's somebody who loves this country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He loves this country so much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That he said this Christmas, he sent everybody all and everybody who's been following him an email saying that this Christmas, he's going to ensure working with our president, that all of our veterans that are homeless on our streets in Long Beach will have a place to stay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when we talk about immigrants and their contributions, I want us to recognize that they're not that far from us, that they're an important part of our economy, that they're important part of our community. I also want to talk about a lot of the flag waving that's going on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's currently a debate nationally about a flag that stood as a symbol of racism, that stood as a symbol of the ugliness. Again, I have my disagreement with the mayor over over the patriotism, because I'm a little bitter at the ugliness that we've seen in this country, because they're this country is based on a long history of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'telling people, no, you don't have the right to have the same resources I have. You don't have the right to be recognized as a valid human being. You don't have the right to do anything besides work and not have the opportunity to education, not have the opportunity to have a diverse city council member.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You don't have the right to create your own policy. And and I want I know that some councilmembers might have constituents who might be on the fence about this issue. And I just want us all to recognize that many of you have come from a place of struggle.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Many of you have glass ceilings that you are some of the first in your generation to to represent people, to be elected officials. You weren't the right gender or the right color or the right whatever. And and I'm so glad that that we're moving forward on this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I want to thank everybody who's been in support of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you all. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Richard. As far as my information is on file, the American labor movement has always supported human rights. I speak for the AMA, International Executive Council and our members in support of Councilwoman Juliana Gonzalez's comprehensive immigration reform.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Since October, some 57,000 unaccompanied minors, the vast majority from Central America, have crossed the illegal into the United States. Many conservatives are blaming the crisis on President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as DOCA, which allows people brought here illegally as children.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Work, authorization or relief from their deportation. Conservatives say policy that the policy which newly arrived of newly arrived undocumented undocumented immigrants don't qualify for has acted as a magnet, pulling young migrants from violence plagued, poverty stricken countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there's virtually no evidence to support this increasingly popular conservative talking point. Unidos Respeto mucho Podemos. Your God, I own a well, that Umana. Si, se puede. Si, Podemos grass. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Good evening, Honorable Major and Council. My name is Jonathan Solorzano. I am a community organizer with the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition, as well as a lifelong resident of the city of Long Beach and a current resident of the ninth District.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'So I'm here today to show support for the DOC programs and also the need for comprehensive immigration reform. As you've already heard from our community residents, this is something the city really needs to get behind, because the truth is, our communities are disillusioned.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'They are disillusioned because undocumented immigrants deal with a variety of problems from housing, work prospects, wage theft, family separation and discrimination. We know our nation's immigration system is broken. And while we know it's difficult for local government to influence federal legislation, you have the power tonight to vote and show the nation what a city who embraces its'",
        "'speaker_16': 'immigrants looks like. Our community needs you to take a stand. Just as the mayors of two of the largest immigrant communities in the nation, Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles and Mayor de Blasio of New York, as well as countless other other public figures have done so recently.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And just to show you the support that is behind this resolution, I would actually like to ask those in the audience tonight to please stand. If you are in support of this. I would also like to take the fall to thank the following organizations for supporting this resolution, which are the Lumbee Human Rights Coalition, Greater Long Beach'",

The Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in a Healthy Community Housing Long Beach Latinos in Action Clay then as well as 120 signatures collected from residents throughout this whole process.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And we would also like to thank council members Lina Gonzalez, Suja Lowenthal, Roberta Ranga and Rex Richardson for sponsoring this resolution. And while we are thankful for those who are here, let's not forget the millions affected across the country and the thousands in our city and those deported in this current administration, including my own father.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Thank you for your time, and we hope you'll vote in support of our community.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Of the 1986 immigration amnesty. I remember the 1986 law, and I remember three things about it. We were promised it would be the last amnesty. We were told there would be 2 million recipients and it turned out to be almost 6 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we were told that the border would be secured. So there I'm sure people have heard the definition of insanity.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'It's been a long night. Thank you so much for allowing the public to speak tonight. I would just like to echo what Janet said. We have a problem in Long Beach in our communities with homelessness. It's burgeoning. In my opinion, that should be the focus of a city council.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We have veterans that can't get proper health care. Veterans that are homeless. Living in poverty. These are our citizens. These are people that live on this soil. Americans. Unemployment's very high. It's a jungle out there for the American citizens.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And in my opinion, that should be the focus of a city council, your own citizens that are suffering and it's getting worse. The homelessness on the the civic property, I mean, it's jaw dropping. It's getting worse. That should be the focus of a resolution, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I would just like to add, our nation has over 400,000 foster kids, U.S. kids. The stats show they live in poverty. They're emotionally abused. They should be the focus of our society, our own suffering population. So I would just like to also add, we are a great nation because we are a nation of laws.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And in my opinion, as a city council, a body politic should make resolutions that, say, uphold respect and obey laws. The citizens of the world, this sends the wrong message to our to the world smugglers that that Long Beach well will welcome your activities.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So in closing, please, I would consider a no vote and think of our own suffering citizens. Look on the lawn of the civic center and and and help our own Americans. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I appeal to your conscience.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is why I would like to have your attention. Because by you passing this resolution, you are in violation of federal laws, because this is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Under Article one, Section eight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of the federal government. You do not have the right to pass in resolutions that are going to protect illegal aliens who are here illegally. They are lawbreakers. They cross the border illegally. They broke a federal law by doing that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when they commit a crime in the state of California, that's another violation. So I'm asking you to vote no. On this resolution because you don't have the right to vote on it to begin with. Now, Ricardo Lara is a disgrace to the American people and the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He promotes illegal immigration. You can smile all you want. Mr. Garcia. I know that you're here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's Doctor Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Doctor? Yes. Dr. Garcia. You can smile all you want. But you know what? I'm putting you on notice. If you vote yes on this, we will do our best to get you out of office. Because you don't deserve.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'That's who you should be serving. That's your number one responsibility. Everyone to use. That's your number one responsibility is to serve the American people and not lawbreakers like the illegals behind me who are probably still standing. Maybe not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Anyway, the point I'm making is you should vote no on this resolution. I oppose it 100%. Now, they keep saying that the borders. Our broken. Well, the only reason it's broken is because we have a president who doesn't he doesn't know how to be a president.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He knows how to be an emperor. And that's what he's doing. He is neglecting the laws of this country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He is violating our Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'By what he's doing. The courts eventually are going to put him in this place. The Supreme Court is going to put him in his place and tell him, you can violate our Constitution because it's wrong. So I'm asking you, please vote no on this resolution because you are not holding upholding your law.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Your oath of office. And that's all I have to say. Thank you and God bless the United States of America.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Today. My name is Jonathan Escobedo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm here to talk about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The same thing we're all talking about here, immigration. I would like to say that I have a lot of friends that are.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Illegal as well and that I've.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Seen so far. They actually put more work into school than all of these people that have that are illegal here. I have friends then in heart transplants, but they can't have them because they're illegal. I have too many friends.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I see them suffer. It makes me suffer. I just want you guys to vote yes. Have family members suffering like they brought up that we take their jobs when we actually take jobs that they are not willing to take.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As illegal immigrants start from the bottom. They go all the way to the top by themselves. These guys don't know what they're talking about. They're being lazy. Some people be lazy. They have all the advantage of being legal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When we immigrants do not know no advantage, we take advantage of them, leaving us open spots at work. So that's I have more to say, but I'll leave it as that.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Mayor Garcia and all council members. My name is Dora and I'm from Acle. At this time, I don't want to talking about all of our Constitution because all of you are still there, no more than me.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Now I'm going to go back to back to the council, Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, because you didn't make comments. Yeah, that's right. Yes. Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's okay. I first want to thank everyone who spoke. I think everyone, for the most part was very eloquent. I think I also want to thank my council colleagues, Suranga Lowenthal and Richardson, for bringing this forward with me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I first have to spend like maybe 2 seconds to give this energy. It really doesn't deserve more energy than that. But I find that some of the comments, it literally makes my skin crawl to hear the the level of hatred, the level of racism in some in some cases that is being portrayed by some individuals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just it just really literally makes me very sick to my stomach. These are not aliens. What's alien to me is that we call people. Aliens were alien. What's alien to me is that we still refer to people as less.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Than we cannot be, actually. The public comment is over. So, sir, no more public comment. Now it's time for the Council to make their comment, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And so, as I was saying, it really is alien to me that we're still referring to people that way. With that said, an aside, there are real people, real faces. We've seen every single one of them in line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Their students, their mothers, their fathers, their workers. They contribute to society. They pay taxes there. You know, my mother is an immigrant. There are so many different people that contribute to not only the city of Long Beach, but to the the nation as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's important that we're supporting this. We are the international city. So if somebody isn't interested in supporting this or they they feel that it's not a good idea to be hateful towards this. And what I would say is, you know, Long Beach is, like I said, an international city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are different languages spoke here. We have the largest population of Cambodians outside of the the country. We have almost 40%, over 40% Latino in this population. And what's important is that there are people that raise families here, like myself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We raise families. We have jobs, there are educated people. There are a lot of good things that are coming from our immigrant immigrant communities. Comprehensive immigration reform is is needed so that families can stay together. Immigrant families contribute to the U.S. economy in a variety of ways.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's time for them to be a part of our greater American society and for us to support them here in the city of Long Beach. Well, this is a federal issue. It is also truly a neighborhood block by block issue that is about families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like I said, individuals, employees, they contribute to our society. The Council has taken supportive stances on specific immigration reform issues in the past, like DOCA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. We've all supported also supported the DREAM Act in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In February, the Federal Legislative Committee made the Directive support comprehensive immigration reform. And today, I want to strengthen that by passing this resolution. I know we've all heard it before, but we really needed to take a stance as a city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'While we cannot make these federal policy decisions at the council level, we can work to support our immigrant communities who are vibrant and active part of our city in so many ways. As a resolution states, immigrant communities contribute so much to our local economy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are our fathers, our mothers, our students. They pay taxes. They are here to stay. They're not going away. Their families, they raise our families. All of the positive things that we can we can mention in a dignified, well-planned path that includes taking the steps necessary to become a full fledged citizen is a must.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many others took these steps, and we must honor that process. I hope that my council colleagues can support me at this time and I thank them.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'It's important that they never unite reform of the immigration game. I tried hard, but I told those barrelhouse Americanos. That was what the Multi-Course commandos played on was one of the Mohicans. Goebel told us that those places Gibson was extremely lucky in Long Beach, Samuelsen When I see that bicultural, bilingual eat mostly lost me as moderators there'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So what if you read it and there in Westeros that it was common was a mass. You're so equal with the immigrants. I am the son of immigrants and I had just as much right to be in this country as you do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm insulted when people say. We have to look after our Americans. I am an American. I live here. And I'm going to die. I'm not going to die. So I'm going to support this issue because it's very important that we protect our rights, our rights to live in this country, our rights to work here, our rights'",

Presidential candidate Jeb Bush has stated flatly he supports immigration reform and he will do something about it when he gets elected.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said the same thing. Presidential candidate Hillary Smith. Hillary Smith. You'll hear Hillary Clinton. Well, we'll do the same in terms of immigration reform. It's coming, folks. It's coming. So you might as well be prepared for it, because all these citizens that not citizenry here are going to become citizens.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know what they can do? They're going to vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up next up is Councilor Richardson. And please for everyone in the audience, I know we've done public comment. I'm trying to keep our decorum and for everyone, please. So let's please be respectful of both. Those are speaking as we did during the public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So next, I have Councilmember Andrews. Do I actually have Andrew and then I'll go Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. You know, it's amazing to sit here and listen to the comments from the various people because the fact that being a minority myself as a black man and I'm hearing these comments about immigrants. You know, I don't think any of the individuals asked to come here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If they say America Home, the great land of the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Free, why wouldn't you want to be here?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I think of so many things when I talk about, you know, I work at a school, Coco Brazil. I've watched those students. Who work harder than anyone I've seen there to let you know that a lot of their parents are immigrants and a lot of those immigrants a lot of those individuals are immigrants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't do this because of a political platform. I do it because I know it's right. We all have a right to live in America. Everyone has a right to be in America. And you should not have to live under the embassy of, you know, being an illegal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You please. Illegal. What is that? You know, like I said, I'm a believer in reform and, you know, immigration in the past in the United States. But the Hispanics and the Cambodian community, I've seen many families in my district separate and destroyed by current deportation policies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there's nothing that I can do to help them. The Families United is the strongest that I know of, and we must protect the rights of all families to stay together. A family stays together, prays together. That is the only way you can live in a country like this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have to give them a right to be together. You don't separate anyone from their family. I would totally support this issue. And the thing he brought to the diocese. Thank you very much, Lena, for doing this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up next up is council member Richardson Jones. And I know I know everyone is supportive or not supportive, but if we could just try to get through the comments and please no side comments, I'd really appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know it's difficult, but please. Councilor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez, for bringing this resolution forward and to all the cosigners for for signing on to this item. So I know that so the city council is well documented on this. We've already sort of in our federal legislative agenda process, we've already demonstrated support and expressed that support to the federal'",
        "'speaker_12': 'government for comprehensive immigration reform. And in terms of the president's executive action, it's been said that we should focus on our residents or our jobs. But I understand where the president is coming from. I represent 56,000 people in the ninth District, and I represent all of them, whether they're documented or not.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We all are one community. We're all when one portion of the community is hurting, the whole community hurts. We're all part of the same social fabric. And I get what the president is trying to do. You know, Congress has let this fester for far too long.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And he took what action was in what was within his power to prioritize certain actions, to place a priority on families and communities. And that's smart. It's economically smart here in Long Beach, here in California. If we just move forward with with adopting DOCA, we would see almost $1,000,000,000 annually in in revenue to our own budget.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is that something that we should not support as a local person who analyzes and manages the budget every year? It makes economic sense in terms of sort of the the culture in this country right now. I'm just sort of taken aback at at the comments because, you know, just less than two weeks ago, we had folks sounding'",
        "'speaker_12': 'very using very similar erratic rhetoric that we've heard tonight go into a church and do something very violent and very, very based on hate, based on hate and ignorance. And very easily, you can take out the word you can use those statements tonight and swap out the word illegal for the N-word very easily.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And this will sound very similar to that. And it's and it's just not okay here in here and here in Long Beach. So what I would say is I'm I'm an unequivocally unequivocal support to this. I think that Long Beach is is we have a responsibility just like so many states.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Spoke up opposed to executive action. We have a responsibility to speak up in support of executive action. A part of the democratic process. When we go to DC, we tell them what our priorities are. As chair of Fed Ledge, we're going to express our priorities and express our support for this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's it. Thank you again for bringing this forward. And I'm going to vote yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Next up is Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I concur with my colleagues. I'm very thankful for the passion of Councilmember Gonzalez, as well as your anger and others who've spoken tonight. And I want to thank all of you that have come forward, actually, those who are in favor and those who are not in favor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I actually thank you as well. It's a constant reminder that we have so much farther to go. You know, this morning, many of us read in the paper that Governor Nikki Haley requested that the Confederate flag be removed from the state capital.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I was reminded that it's never too late to do the right thing. In 150 years, we may have only moved incrementally. But we've moved in leaps and bounds in so many different ways. And I'm reminded even tonight from the Rich conversation that we've had sometimes boisterous, a lot of times very disrespectful, which is unfortunate that life'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is rich and it's textured and it's complex. Just as complex, rich and textured as the people living them. But we have a shared tapestry in our history. Whether you believe that we are a nation of immigrants or you don't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The truth remains that we actually are rewriting that history. Is one way of living the rest of your life. But I'm comforted knowing that a great majority of us don't choose to rewrite that history. We understand our shared tapestry, and we understand that it's unfinished.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When you see people that whether they toil in their own countries or they toil in this country, certainly when I see them, I am reminded of my own parents who immigrated here. And whether they did legally or not is of no consequence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm reminded of why people leave their. Nation of origin and why they leave their nation of birth. It's a very simple thing to understand, and it's because we want to protect our children and we want to give our children.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What we can and possibly what we're able to give. And that's not different from when our nation was founded. People left Europe to give the same thing to their children. And so. I'm thankful for the discourse and the acrimony that I heard today because I'm always reminded that our job is never done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This morning's single act of removing a relic from a time in our history that shouldn't either be celebrated or forgotten for the worst of its four bearings reminds us, just as this conversation does tonight, that our tapestry is unfinished, whether we move by two degrees or 180 degrees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The fact that we have moved in the right direction is our common cause and our common celebration. And I want to thank Councilmember Lina Gonzalez and the co-sponsors, as well as my entire council for raising awareness and support for the plight of our immigrant families.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You make up our tapestry. I'm proud to be a part, a very small part of that tapestry. I will never forget that. Many of us at this diocese actually are our children, sons and daughters of immigrants. No matter how many generations removed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And sometimes it's that single act of bravery. And it's not ordinary courage. It's tremendous courage when people leave their countries of origin to come here for their children. But a single act like that changes the trajectory of an entire family.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I remind my son of that, that a decision my mother made when she was 16 changed the trajectory of my life and has. And so that's something to be celebrated, not not reviled in the way that we hear today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, again, the discourse that we heard in the language that we heard is unfortunate. But I'm thankful for it because it reminds me never to get comfortable and never to look away from the ugliness that exists. Because the moment we look away is the moment we think our work is done and our work is not done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you, counsel, colleagues. And like Councilmember Richardson said, the political jockeying between parties and between presidential hopefuls has undermined serious conversations on comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level and perhaps even stoked the fire of resentment. Some of that which we heard tonight in our communities rather than an honest conversation about those issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think it's a surprise for you to hear. I support our urging of comprehensive reform that reflects our nation's values, not just the values of a few, but our collective conscience. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I, too, want to thank my colleagues for bringing this item forward. I am the daughter of an immigrant, and I don't believe that this is a Latino issue or any specific race. We are a nation of immigrants, and immigrants in this country comprise some of the most hardworking and honest and dedicated people among our society'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And I take a little bit of issue with any sort of allegation or assumption that there is a specific group of people that are committing the crimes in this nation. The reality is people are committing crimes every day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'White people, black people, Latino people, people of all different colors. We've seen it in recent times. Some of the most horrendous crimes that we see are committed by our very own members of our community. So, too, to try to blame crime on a particular race or status is just wrong and it's factually inaccurate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I do I do take offense to that because I don't think it's fair to label an entire community of people. Some of the people we heard from tonight represent some of the most hardworking people that you'll ever see, people who have 2 to 3 jobs to provide for their children so that their children can grow up'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in a land of opportunity. Those those parents should be commended for giving their children an opportunity at a better life. I had that opportunity. Many of my colleagues have that opportunity. And the parents that are working hard and doing their best to survive in this community and make their way through the community should be commended.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do. I appreciate that. Tuesday nights are an exercise in democracy, and I take no issue with the comments that that some have made. Are opposed to this item. That's okay. We have that every week. People feel very passionately about the items that are before us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's okay. But at the end of the day, we live among among one another in a community. And we're all trying to do our best. And that is the bottom line. Every single person is just trying to do their best for their families and give their their children the best opportunities in life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is something to be respected and celebrated. I think that the reality of our country is that we do need comprehensive immigration reform. What the specifics of that reform look like and what the compromises and the provisions and the final agreements will be, is something that still has to be discussed at a national level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the idea that we have to look at this as a nation and figure out where the uncertainties are and what needs to be refined is important. And so I support this item and I support the resolution being brought by Councilwoman Gonzalez and my colleagues to this body.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And usually most of my council colleagues know that any time issues like this come up, my first reaction is always, what does this have to do with Long Beach and why are we getting involved? I generally like us to focus on things that impact our city alone and really have our focus be on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But this issue does impact our city. It does and impacts a large number of residents in this city and a large number of children who go to school in our schools, in this city. And it's important that we're advocates for those children as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's where my standpoint is when I'm coming from this is, you know, what about those children and their future and the fact that they're here and we as a nation have a duty to look out for them as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'First of all, I am. I. I'm not unapologetic for my outburst. It was because I did have prepared remarks. But I just get too caught up in the moment that I had to say what I had to say.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I meant it all. Every bit of it. But I do want to give some thank you's to Congresswoman Janice Hahn, assembly member Patrick O'Donnell, state senator representing the representatives here to express their support of this issue. I think they recognize that it's an important issue, that one that needs to be supported and we need to support'",
        "'speaker_9': 'our president and working towards and our Congress towards comprehensive immigration reform. And I also want to say that to my mom and dad, who were immigrants here, who after 50 years became citizens and had the opportunity to vote for a rang up for their first vote.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And before my mother passed two years ago in 2012, she died in November right around Thanksgiving. But she was very proud that she voted for President Obama and that she voted for him twice. So. When we look at immigration reform and we look at the opportunity for a path to citizenship, I think that the conversation is going'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to take a shift because there's going to be a lot of people out there wanting to change that conversation that we presently have now and the vitriol that we hear tonight. I hopefully will go away. I hope we'll go away.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. And I do want to thank our Councilmember Gonzales for bringing this forward. I will be voting in support of this myself. We as a country, we've kind of kick the can down the road for far too long.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The time for comprehensive immigration reform is now. The problem has been exacerbated because we have failed to address it as a country. Our president has tried to move, move, move forward and advance the issue. And it's become a obviously a very political football that has divided a lot of us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I appreciate the passionate responses and comments from my colleagues. I appreciate the passion from many of you who bravely came up here and testified today on this important issue. Long Beach is, as someone said, is the international city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a city of great diversity that we celebrate. And I don't think we would. I don't think we can honestly support breaking up families. People are. Here undocumented. Not because they chose to be here. A lot of them children are born here, too, to undocumented parents.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They're in our schools. They are are part of our society. They are they're a shadow economy, oftentimes in our kitchens of our restaurants. We need to rectify that. And in doing so, we need to support a path to citizenship.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez, and everyone else. And we I'm serving on this dais with children of immigrants and with immigrants themselves. That's the beauty of America. That's that's why we come to this country. That's why we're proud to be Americans.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so with that, I'm happy to support this and thank you for bringing it forward. I got sick to my stomach earlier as well, so I'm going to be excusing myself after this vote. But I wanted to stay around to make sure that I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I voted yes on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Just I'll make a couple of brief comments and then we'll go and go to the vote. I'm maybe I'm I'm not sure this is part of the motion or not, Councilwoman, but I think it's probably appropriate that this, as being passed by the council tonight, would become officially also part of the federal agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And so I know is asking our government affairs director and some of the assumption is, Mr. City attorney, that this would then become part of that agenda, if that's part of the motion?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. And then the second thing I'll say is I just want to echo something that was mentioned earlier, and I think it's really important. You know, one of the things that I love about this country and I think I think this is the greatest country on the planet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's the greatest country on earth. And one of the things that I love about this country is that we live in a democracy where people are able to have different opinions. And we can respectfully disagree. We can respectfully agree, but we have different opinions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what what we should love about this great place that we live in is that whether we agree or disagree, we can do it in a way that's respectful and we can do it in a way that really lives up to the ideals of what this country was founded on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I there was a comment earlier about the Council focusing on on issues, on a variety of issues. And I just want to address those. I think they're important veterans. Veteran veterans were brought up in homelessness and unemployment, all incredibly important issues that the city works on continuously.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm proud of the fact that homeless homelessness is down in Long Beach by 18%. I'm proud of the fact that unemployment is at its lowest it's been in 15 years, that we have a great foster program in large part a lot of interest brought on to it because of Council Brough, Austin and others that and within'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the system that we have here. I'm proud that we have a goal to house every veteran in Long Beach that is experiencing homelessness by the end of this year. So these are all really, really great goals. I think these are goals are probably a lot of everyone in this audience can agree that it's the right thing to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'do. But I also think that supporting our our immigrants for supporting the men and women, but especially the children that are undocumented in our country in ways that I think we're very reasonable there. These are ways that these are regulations that I think our president has proposed that are reasonable, they're humane, they're thoughtful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're not radical in any sort of way. I think they're very American regulations are very American policies. And so I want to thank everyone for for the conversation tonight. It's certainly been very, very vivid and very lively. But I want to thank Councilwoman Gonzales for for bringing this forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so with that, we'll call the vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion passes nine zero.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Now we'll go on to the next item. So we're going to go back. Okay. So 1112, we're going to go on to item 13, I believe.'",

Action Plan for the Expenditure of Community Development BLOCK Grant, Home Investment Partnership Grant and Emergency Solutions Grant Funds and execute all necessary documents with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to receive these funds citywide'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you. Can I get a motion, please? Oh, there's a motion and a second. Is there any public comment on this item? CNN. Let me start with Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to thank staff for their hard work on this. I took a moment to just look through this item a bit on CDBG and a few things really just stood out to me. So I just have a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So. So first, I see that there's a significant amount of documentation here around public outreach or public engagement, citizen engagement around this. Is that a mandate? Is that mandatory for us to track or to conduct public input on how these funds are allocated for these for this these funds?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, sir, it is.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Are there any, like goals or benchmarks for how much engagement we should actually have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We actually have to do a five year action plan, and then every five years we update that action plan. But annually, we have to demonstrate that we are meeting the goals of that five year action plan. So it's an annual review of a five year action plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what's before you tonight is the fourth annual review of our action plan. We are required to have extensive community outreach. We are required to have two hearings. Those hearings were held by the Long Beach Community Investment Corporation, and we are required to do significant public outreach and demonstrate that we have done that outreach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do translate this into different languages. We publish notices in different newspapers of different languages, and we hold community meetings and send out E notifies. So we do do quite a bit of extensive outreach when we do the five year action plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our outreach basically goes on steroids. And we we actually have surveys and try to reach thousands of people in our community outreach.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. So just based on that, it sounds like, you know, every five years there's significant outreach and there's a little bit of outreach for each of the updates. What really stood out to me when we say substantial outreach or intense levels of outreach was looking at Appendix A where it says the there was a public hearing'",
        "'speaker_12': 'meeting with no public comments. There was a meeting at MacArthur Park with no public comments, a Washington neighborhood meeting with no public comments. It'll be CIC with no public comments. And when I look at this, you know, it's a significant amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think we do a good job of budgeting it. But I think the city council is really set to set a standard now for how we engage and how we move forward and budget budget money and actually get input.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Like for as a as an example, we did a pilot project for participatory budgeting. I know a number of other districts did as well. And to compare what we were able to do in a few months around a much smaller amount of money, I think this is millions of dollars.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And what we did was, you know, for $250,000 for engagement, you know, while actually applying rules and all the standards to it, I think this is this this just shows us that we can just do more. So so I want to thank you for the hard work that that's taking place with this over over the years.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I, you know, next year, I'd like to see us do something a little more significant as it relates to HUD funds. And and, you know, I'm sure Fed legend, the federal government has actually said that that they'd like to see a city take on a participatory budgeting process for for CDBG.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's something I'm interested in exploring. I just wanted to chime in and make that comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Understood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I would just echo what Councilman Richardson said in terms of public outreach. I think that is a really good point. It's he he really led the way on council for the PB process. I know District three and District one followed suit and the community engagement that we received and we were dealing with $75,000 in three'",
        "'speaker_5': ', but we had, you know, close to 800 votes in a very short period of time and lots of people being engaged in the process. So anything that we can do to to help promote public engagement and public outreach, I think that's really important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think Councilman Richardson raises a good point that, you know, with the new leadership on. Council. We have a very strong focus on making sure that the public is involved in everything that we do and that they're along for the ride.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that's very, very important to me. And so if we can get that that spirit moving, not that that staff's not already doing that, but we can improve upon it and perhaps use some of the energy of the new council in terms of outreach and getting people involved in allocating funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that would be a great direction to take. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would suggest this is probably very appropriate for when we update the five year action plan. But when we're in the fifth year of a five year action plan next year, we're really trying to meet our goals and objectives of the first plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I may suggest that that's something that we would look at definitely for when we implement the five year action plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next. I have Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know you just answer that, but I would just have to concur with the colleagues. I think participatory budgeting really opened up our eyes as to what was possible and in reaching a different group. You know, we have Washington neighborhood had group in the first district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But a lot of those, you know, they're not as organized. So with the participatory budgeting, we were able to get a lot more residents that normally aren't part of the process. So I would just have to include that as well.'",
