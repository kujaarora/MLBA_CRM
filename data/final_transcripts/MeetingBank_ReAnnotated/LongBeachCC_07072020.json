    "Ordinance Amendment on Interim Housing Regulations. ": [
        "'speaker_3': 'Refrain from doing so. We're going to go ahead and go into our first hearing and and then right into public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record concluded the public hearing declared ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to interim housing. Read the first time and lead over the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading and adopt a resolution to submit the ordinance amendments to the California Coastal Commission'",
        "'speaker_0': 'citywide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Go ahead. Read this overstep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mara, I'd like to introduce the development services staff that will make this presentation. We have Oscar Orsi, Development Services Director, as well as Alejandro Sanchez Lopez for this presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor, and members of the city council. Alejandro, our project planner, will give you a brief presentation. Good afternoon, honorable mayor and members of the City Council. The item before you today the citywide zoning code amendment to update the definitions, land use regulations and operating standards related to various forms of interim housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This update seeks to address local, regional and statewide housing and homelessness crisis by expanding the zoning opportunities for various forms of interim housing. Update and add definitions for said housing forms and related services. And establish operating standards that are based on best practices for these uses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In doing so, it would bring the city into compliance with applicable policies, most notably SB two, which was adopted in 2007 and has specific zoning requirements for emergency shelters that the city does not currently meet. This update will make it easier to develop interim housing and related uses and broaden the opportunity sites for said uses in an'",
        "'speaker_4': 'equitable manner throughout the city. The next few slides will walk through each of the major changes proposed. This isn't. It's a different kind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again. Staff You guys are putting up a different presentation on the screen right now. So can you please take this one off?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my city clerk is working on pulling that stuff off.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Moving along. First, the update will create a new definition for interim housing. Interim housing is an umbrella term that encompasses all uses involving temporary sleeping accommodations for people experiencing housing insecurity. These uses include emergency shelters, transitional housing rates, housing and safe parking sites.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In a definition. In addition to the definition itself, the update will establish general operating standards for interim housing. These operating standards include a coordinated assessment system to connect residents to services and networks, along with security and lighting requirements for all sites.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next, the definition for emergency shelters will be amended to allow for kitchens and additional supporting amenities in shelters. Shelters will also be allowed as an accessory use in existing religious facilities and as a primary use in certain residential, industrial, commercial and institutional zones to address the dearth of site availability currently allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a map here shows, current zoning regulations severely restrict where shelters are permitted in the city. The following map shows where Seltzers may be permitted either by write or with an entitlement. The hatching indicates an entitlement is required in that corresponding zone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next, the definition for transitional housing will eliminate a minimum length of stay. Specify a target population and require there to be a link to supportive services. Land use regulations will also be updated to expand this housing to be allowed in the industrial and commercial zones shown on the map as well as pre permitted in an ancestor use'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and when incidental to a primary institutional use. Next, a new definition will be created for safe parking sites. Safe parking programs have become more common throughout the state. Different jurisdictions addressed the housing crisis at the local level. These sites are limited to properties outside of the right of way that are managed by an institutional or nonprofit organization'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to provide a safe place to park overnight for folks who are working towards gaining permanent housing. These sites help to address how to maintain public safety, provide services to people at risk of falling into cyclical homelessness, and prevent spillover effects into residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Safe parking sites are proposed to be permitted in limited commercial, industrial and institutional zones as an accessory and as an accessory use in all zones only where all lots are owned and operated by the same entity. The update will also establish operating standards to minimize the impact these sites have and implement best practices.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next, the definition for supportive housing will be amended to specify the various populations that can be served by this use. Additionally, the land use regulations will be expanded to allow for more sites in certain industrial and commercial zones, as shown on the map.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next. Social Services. Social services facilities will have the definition updated to broaden the scope of applicable services, such as showers or storage facilities, Imani's for pets and meal services. These facilities will also be permitted in additional commercial zones.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Finally, it is important to note that this proposal is not in conjunction with any one specific project, but merely a zoning change. In all zones where an interim housing use is allowed by. Right. Any project will still be required to submit for an administrative land use review.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This review process maintains a level of staff oversight and an appeals process for any agreed parties, but it does also provide a reduced application cost and a streamlined process for applicants. As an example, the map on the right shows that Magnolia Industrial Group Business Improvement District area in the Purple outlined the majority of this area, which is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hatch wood acquired and entitlement for an emergency shelter to be located there or any project in the areas in dark gray at the North and South ordinance would be required to go through the administrative land use review process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a reminder, city staff conducted three public outreach events and two presentations to the Planning Commission. Public comment at the outreach events was generally supportive of the code changes. In addition to the public outreach notice of a public hearing was published in the Long Beach Press Telegram on June 23rd of this year and notice of the proposed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'code amendment was distributed throughout the city. Link Lobby. Email Notification System. City Councilors before them. The public comments submitted to the city since a hearing notice of public. In conclusion, the Planning Commission's recommendations that the City Council accept the negative declaration for the project, approve the Interim Housing Zoning Code Amendment, and adopt a resolution to submit the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Code Amendment to the California Coastal Commission. Thank you for your time. This includes staff presentation. I'm available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'm going to start with councilman's in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much for this presentation. I know that it it is something very good that, you know, that we're doing this and I am supportive. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second by Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you staff. I am really happy to see this come before us today. I think that the city, at least in my four years on the council, we consistently try to identify new locations. We consistently have conversations about where else in the district or in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can put some of these transitional supportive housing and also safe parking. And so I was happy to see a lot of areas marked in the second district. I had one question. You mentioned that existing ones would still have to go through a review to be able to operate there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to make sure that we're not and I think I know the answer, but we're not setting ourselves up to where like our transitional parking that we've already identified in those locations that going through this process would mean that they no longer could operate that transitional parking where we've already identified areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. Councilmember, this is Christopher Coons. To answer more precisely, existing uses that were approved by the city have existing rights to continue. I think that reference was made to there are operating standards associated with this package in front of council and we will be attempting to apply those operating standards to all entities, including those that already exist'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So this is going to help us in terms of our community expectations and being able to to make sure the operations are run well. The other thing is we oftentimes see these entities grow or change and they subsequently come back to the city for various permits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In that case, these new regulations would apply to them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful. And I had a question about outreach. I knew about them at the Planning Commission. I have to say that it either on my end or I'm not sure what what slipped through, but I was not aware of the public meetings being had around this topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So can you share with me how we did those meetings? I see. One was locally here near us at the Mark Twain Library. How were those notified and what was attendance like for those? Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman. This is Alexis Harpaz.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A current planning officer at the. Three events. So the two open house meetings were advertised via the link L.B. as well as to stakeholders. And on our link l be notification. It's about 1500 people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Subscribed to that and the attendance at both of the meetings was ranged between 20 and 25 people total. Yeah. I just. I really love this idea, and I wish that I saw more areas on the map that were open to that and so on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I guess my last question would be the consideration around putting these really only in the commercial zones and adjacent areas. Can you just speak to that before I give my wholehearted excitement support for this item?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir. Council Member So this is a legislative item and we feel that it correctly addresses an existing problem where the city is out of compliance with state law and city attorney is on the line, if you'd like to hear more about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I hear your comment. I think that staff was balancing input from stakeholders that, you know, some may have like your comment felt that that additional sites were needed. Other comments were received that what the city is proposing is too many sites or includes parts of town, that it's not included.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So our goal was to expand the number of available sites to do so consistent with state law and federal guidance and to do something that was workable and an improvement against the status quo. We're going to evaluate these as part of our housing element and as part of our annual reports back to council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if what we've come up with tonight is not sufficient, it would be within Council's discretion to add additional areas or make changes in the future. You have public comments in your packet. Some of those comments are positive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some of them are negative. It's never a fun position, but oftentimes we know we found a sweet spot when not anyone is perfectly satisfied and everyone is only slightly dissatisfied. And we think that that's where we found ourselves with the regulations that are in front of the Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I really appreciate that thoughtful comment and that I wholeheartedly support the fine. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. You know, I do have other council members. I have a comment, but I didn't see it. Is there any comments from anyone else, Madam Clerk, that we need to do from the public or any sort of appellant comment that has to happen?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or can I continue with the Council comments?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are three public comments for this item. If you'd like to continue with those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, are they are they connected to the actual hearing or are they just just public comments?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, they're connected to the actual hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Let me let me let me do let me do. No, I understand it. But I mean, is this members of the public or are these individuals that are that staff has been working on as part of the hearing that was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Members of the public?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay, then let me finish with the councilwoman. I'll go to the members of the public. Perfect. So Councilman Richardson and Councilman Super now I'm fine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I cued up the second, but I've got to my comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The ultimate super or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just had a question for staff. If you could walk us through the parking things and specifically the traffic circle area on the map that it shows, like a big red area. And if anything you can add to how this process will work, that would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So the safe parking sites, we do have at least one operating in the city today. And what we were trying to do was formalize the opportunity for that use. So the map on the slide, which does include some commercial sites around the traffic circle, as well as sites throughout the city, are just locations that the zoning'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would now allow for a safe parking use. There are no locations proposed at this moment and they would need to go through the appropriate process. And these typically are an accessory use, which means you have a primary use that could be a church most commonly, but might be a different type of use or social service use, even'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a retail use. And they allow folks that are living in their vehicle to safely park overnight. This is something that occurs without the benefit of regulation throughout the city today. And what we're trying to do is have it occur in safe locations with specific standards so that things like waste and noise are controlled.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you did note that the location within your district, but if you can see the slide, there are locations in every council district of the city. And what we're trying to accomplish is places for people who are living in their car to try to park overnight without being towed, but to do so in a safe manner, where'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there is a sponsor who is making sure that the location is clean and orderly and that folks, to the degree possible, are matched with social services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I don't have anyone else on the council to do that. Mr. Clarke, can you do the public comment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First we have Janet West. Your time starts now. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, I objected to this zoning update. The public was not informed on Housing First. State law, which requires admission of drug and alcohol users even if they refuse to get rehabilitative therapy services. The public was not informed that the target population and current ordinances will be eliminated for supportive housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In fact, there was misleading information on that table and personnel did not include looking at AB 1763, passed in 2019, which includes major density and incentives for these housing developments. The public was not informed of the increased parking problems which which will result from these changing changes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The public was not informed that these developments are not restricted to Long Beach area residents. The public was not informed that a person may be designated as homeless solely based on their oral statement. That there's a possibility of them becoming homeless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The public was only given a vague, term, appropriate level of security with no indication of what that means. The public was not informed of how the neighborhood compatibility will be achieved with no required on site staff. If anything, that COVID 19 has taught us is that we should not be increasing density.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These new ordinance will increase density, especially with the major increases to the density for low income housing. Supportive Service. Supportive housing is included in all the residential areas of the city. This will change our city and it will change it forever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And although I know the supportive housing requirements are, for them to be in all residential areas is a state law. Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Should not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be increasing the likelihood of these developments being built. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank your next speakers and control your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. And Cantrell. And my main objection to this is lack of notice. I don't receive the press telegram, as many do not also don't. And the only notice I am aware of was. Published in the Press Telegram on June 1st.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am very. Much agree that we need to get the homeless off the streets and into safe and sanitary conditions. But there was no time to read all the pros and cons on this item, and I urge you to lay it over till the public has been informed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also carelessly attempted to sign in to speak and missed the 12:00 deadline because it's not published. So I would like to read.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Comments. She says there are many good things in the every home report, every one home report. And I'm pleased the city is moving out to work to work out the homeless issue. However, many residents in Long Beach do not know about this rezoning and do not realize the rezoning could result in a low barrier homeless facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Close proximity to their neighborhoods and schools. Low barrier means the clientele are not obligated to commit to drug or alcohol rehab and the mentally ill who at times exhibit violent behavior, will be residing in these facilities. Only two public meetings were held on this back in January, which is inadequate public outreach on a serious topic that will'",
        "'speaker_1': 'change streets and neighborhoods. I doubt more than 25 people in the city know about the rezoning plans. Please delay moving forward with approving rezoning and request that town hall meetings be held in all districts to roll out the Everyone Home report and capture and integrate public input into these plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm concerned that policy statements in the Everyone Home report are being implemented without a public vetting process. The maps shown in the staff report seem to identify locations, but there is no verbiage that makes these maps a governing document, and that is the conclusion of Chorus's report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our last speaker is to Africa. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. Dave sugar on file? I'm speaking to you from outside City Hall, where I'm staring at a lot of confetti. Two quick points. Density does not mean overcrowding. And that's a very important thing in the middle of a global pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want people to be able to live. And live well and live safely. And we seem to do it just fine now, though, we're building more buildings. But second point, equity is not about keeping people. Right. I mean, even from people who got in the game, it's about picking the team that puts people in this socially antagonistic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'relationship, like being a perpetrator and the victim or mistaken identity or overgrowth. We're in the middle of a pandemic. We have a vested interest in not only compassionate. Servicing and the application thereof. But in continued public education will thank.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for that. And there is no way I'm going to go and cause a hearing. There is no more council comment either. And we'll go ahead and do a roll call vote. Please call the Robert.'",

I'd also like to thank a city staff, especially Theresa Chandler, for all her outstanding work that she's been putting into this day in and day out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you know, based on the results of our homeless count that we that were released this month, Long Beach saw a 7% increase in our numbers of unsheltered people from 2019 to 2020. We should also be clear that this does not reflect the thousands of people who have likely become house homeless during this time of COVID 19'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Even after an outbreak of COVID 19. I was hearing from my residents every day that they're looking for solutions to help address homelessness. And each day, my colleagues and I would say the same thing. This means that. As a community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We all know that homeless is is a huge problem and it needs to be addressed. This said, our current circumstances have left us with opportunities to rethink what emergency housing looks like. In California, Project Roomkey has helped draw a line between the needs of our unsheltered neighbors and our historical low motel occupancy rate during COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whether someone wishes to stay with with a partner, a family or animal companions, or if the fear of violence and health issues is in a shelter project room key and the ability to use the motels as emergency shelters has really helped during this time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Unlike emergency shelters which have low occupancy rate, our project ROOMKEY units are at 97% occupied. So which which also indicates that there's a big need for them and that folks are actually being. I mean, folks are actually taking advantage of having this opportunity.'",

We also have the opportunity to offset some of these some of these costs. With efforts and working together with the state and federal funding that is that is going to be available and is available at this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'time. In terms of funding, I think it's important to note that while items request. Staff to to come back in 30 days. Many opportunities are are very short time. So we must act quickly on this. This month alone, $5,500 million became available from the state of coronavirus relief funds for motel acquisitions and non congregational bridging housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The funding begins to be has begun to be distributed and it is a first come, first served basis. So this is why it's also very important to act now. There's also additional 450 million of the state coronavirus relief fund that will be available for cities who have not previously received their own unique allocation of CRF dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach included. The city is also set to receive 13.8 million in phase two emergency solution grants from the Federal Government of Housing and Urban Development. These funds can be put towards non congregational shelters as well. And finally, it is the.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much, Mia. I first of all, I think council and data will engage me on this item. You know, in my opinion, this woman in District six has been the most proactive in building and accepting affordable housing in the district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You go down Long Beach Boulevard, you'll see it. We're still building. Revamping current motels into supportive housing is a very creative way to approach blight and illegal activities already occurred. And these sites. With the proper safety protocol and community engagement and this idea, I think we can approach two problems with one solution.'",

And this is also the case with housing, transitional housing and trying to make sure that we provide services for those that are experiencing homelessness. I know that this council has long reviewed opportunities to be able to add additional transitional housing, as was noted with the hearing item'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that we had today. And so I love this item. I would like to ask staff on the what are we currently doing? And the funding sources that councilmembers and DE have mentioned are those opportunities that we think we can make a big impact.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And is that impact only in being able to provide additional vouchers and incentives? Or where are we with the bigger conversation that we've had about being able to purchase some of these motels that have been problem areas in transit, turn them over to transitional housing?'",

And as we've had the opportunity to work with Project ROOMKEY and have it have participants in Project ROOMKEY, we certainly don't want every turn those folks into homelessness.'",

And so the application guidelines have not quite been released, but we will be applying for those funds. And so we do have an affordable housing workgroup within our city teams where we are putting together lists of potential sites for acquisition'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And of course, you know, we can look at the sites, hotels, motels, different things across the city available for acquisition. The issue has always been how to fund the programs ongoing. So with the current funding coming in through the Emergency Solutions Grant and also the second round of HAP funding, the expectation of about $3 million to come'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to Long Beach. There are some opportunities where we can actually move forward with project based vouchers and other types of programing set forth and then also with future HUD funding potentially for permanent supportive housing. So this is a really exciting opportunity for us to move forward and to keep our neighbors experiencing homelessness in housing as they've been'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sheltered. And also just just as a city to collectively wrap our arms around folks who have previously been on the streets. Wonderful. Thank you. And, you know, we've got, I think, four motels off the top of my head that would make great locations in the second District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I fully support that. I also just before passing it on, I want to say, you know, there's been a lot of work that led up to this moment, not only with the current COVID, but with Measure H in the county and Andy Kerr and the housing groups that have done work to get us to this point'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So there's a couple of exciting moments tonight that I just want to make sure we recognize that this is what happens when you never let your foot off the gas and you just continue to try and try and eventually some things will fall into place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you guys for this. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, we have Councilwoman Mango and then Councilmember Richardson. Councilwoman Mongo. That's when Mongo. Okay. Let me move on and come back. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. A couple of things. First of all, thanks for bringing this item forward. Councilmember and House is certainly on time given given all the efforts the city and the region has done to ensure that we don't lose focus on the homelessness issue while we face a crisis on multiple fronts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Two things I want to highlight, though. Look, I understand that the goal is to incentivize folks to participate and project homekey. And and so Homekey is what you know, a lot of the funding that's coming out is Project HOMEKEY separately from Roomkey.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I understand that there's a deadline of July 15 or the process opens July 15th, rather, for hotels and organizations to apply to participate. I know that some of this research may not come back until well after that, but I think that we should do and I hear from staff what I think we should do is use'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our communication channels to make sure that we promote this window that's opening, because I know that other cities are beginning to do that. Let's make sure that we promote that this grant, this opportunity is opening. And then secondly, whatever incentives that we put forward for people to participate, we can maybe talk about those now before they're even'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in place to demonstrate that whoever has participated will receive whatever incentives we're able to put together so that they understand that although the incentive may not be in place today, then it may take, you know, a number of weeks to pull it together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead and apply now for the program. And I think it's important that we we nuance that. Tom, Tom, do you understand what I'm what what I'm trying to articulate here?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I think we do. So we are going to apply for those dollars. And as I understand it, if we get good actors who are working with us and want to be able to do this work and they're really doing a good job, that if we come up with some kind of program in the future on this'",
        "'speaker_5': ', that they would certainly benefit and be a part of that to the extent we can legally do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And and my understanding is when the application opens up, it's not necessarily cities who apply. It would be motel owners and affordable housing developers. And those are the types who would apply for funding. In addition, it may be in addition to cities, but but that's that's the challenge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't have our folks ready and I get a number of motel owners may say, hey, this isn't for me. But they need to understand that, number one, they can make money from this and it helps the city and we will support this this process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so I think the communication to them and making sure that that gets our message gets out is important. Thanks a lot. I'm satisfied there. The second thing that I would say, just, you know, I want to make sure that we are and I've talked with Tracy Longo, who led our motel strategy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to make sure that we connect the dots between our nuisance motel strategy in the city and this project. Homekey, because there may be opportunities for some of these motels that are nuisances. There's already strategies to acquire them that we can leverage some of these resources to make sure that we are we are engaging some of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'these motels so that ultimately we can convert them into a much better use that has less crime, less human trafficking, less violence, and something more stable like affordable housing. I just want to make sure that we lift that a lift up that point that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And next week Councilman Mongo on the line yet her councilman Mongo. Okay. Let me go to Councilwoman Pryce and then, Councilman, your anger.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Q Mr. Mayor, so I want to thank Council members and the House for bringing this item and for her colleagues that are colleagues that signed onto the item. I think it's a fantastic opportunity. I think Councilmember Pearce is correct that as unfortunate as the situations around us have been since the middle of March, they have provided some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'opportunities, especially in terms of grants and opportunities for us to get resources from the state and federal government and the county to try to address some of these issues that we've been talking about for years. So I think this is a great opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also want to acknowledge the great work of the United Way team who I know several of my colleagues had an opportunity to talk with in advance of tonight's meeting, and they just did a fantastic briefing for for those who are like me, who enjoy reading things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought that their briefing sheets were really, really well prepared and very objective. And I just want to acknowledge that we get briefed by a lot of entities and weigh in from a lot of different entities. And I found that the presentation tonight and the efforts by those who care about this topic to educate council members before'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the vote was really fantastic. So I just wanted to acknowledge that and thank you council members and our house for bringing them forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Jan Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I want to agree with the council, my colleagues, in terms of our customers and neighbors bringing this forward. It's a great idea at the time that I've gone beyond our need. We really need to have this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been long overdue, and I'm glad that it's here and that we're discussing this. But as we know, when we're dealing with homeless individuals, we have the additional challenge of the services on there, and they're wanting to take advantage of some of the services that are being offered to them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I'm asking the question as to are there moneys being set aside for additional services to individuals who are experiencing homelessness and who would be able to take advantage of these programs? Because as it's been said before and other previous comments and by researches and papers that we've had, we've seen it takes 14, 15, sometimes'",
        "'speaker_2': '20 contacts with a homeless person before they accept any kind of assistance. So with that, is there any. Plan or any resource is going to be going into helping them personally as well with behavioral services and other types of needs that they may have before you take advantage of these programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry for the delay. Yes, that is always something that we're looking at on how to engage folks. There's more funding through the ESG dollars as well for that that those outreach efforts and which leads into case management. And that really is what helps wraparound folks to get them connected to services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's always that's the first thing we look at when funding opportunities come in that have more flexibility is how we can truly connect with people. Because, as you said, it's about 17 contacts to get people to just say yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But then the real work happens when you want it, when people are then ready to come in and then getting them to stay inside. So that's always a priority for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, again, thank the council members in their house for bringing this forward to full support. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember councilman, among other. Councilman Mongo. I know you said that you're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you hear me? Yes, Mayor. Hi. Thank you. And the mayor? Was I the second year of the motion? Before I got disconnected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before you got disconnected, you know, you queued up against a lawsuit in the queue because you didn't know you were not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you for this opportunity. I really appreciate the work that Councilwoman Sun has said and her team also along with the work the city staff did. This is important stuff. I think that fining people homes is the first step.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also need to have the plans that go with the the motel room opportunities. So I like that this is a comprehensive approach. I like that the city is looking at this along with many other things, including rent abatement and other things for that fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's important to outline and oversee all the funds in their entirety. And while I appreciate the item and signed on to it, because it's important, it's also important for us to take each of those funds as they come in and evaluate all the different opportunities for working and healing and supporting the residents of our city'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So I just want to keep that in perspective as we go forward. There are a lot of funds. I know the city staff put together quite a comprehensive list of of opportunities that we can use these funds. And so I want to make sure that we look at the best return on investment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think this is a very good return. When we do house people. We also need to make sure that those individuals then move into more permanent housing to reopen those beds up for other individuals who need the transitional housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. I got it. Before I turn this back over to councilman and he has to close. Want to just add so I know there's been a lot of work in this area happening. I think this is a great piece of legislation to kind of put all that together and and move the city forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wanted to just maybe ask Mr. Kerley, who's probably, I'm guessing, is on the line as well. So there have been a lot of efforts this year, I know through the through the mayor's group and just through our legislative or legislative calendar, an agenda on obviously getting more funding directly for homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obviously, Project ROOMKEY has been a big part of the governor's initiative around COVID. Do you do you Mr.. Mr. Kerley, how much did we get from a funding perspective? I don't I couldn't remember the number of stuff in my head.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we made a last minute push to get additional funding for homelessness separate of the COVID recovery money. You have that number for Long Beach by any chance for this year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Separate from the hotel motel acquisition program, they set aside 300 million total for homeless services. And we're estimating based on last year's allocation methodology, that we would receive around 3 million this year for homeless services. And those are separate from the CARES Act dollars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they're tied to the general fund and are not tied to the December deadline for using those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are programmatic dollars. And then how much money is in the kind of hotel motel acquisition bucket that the governor put in place?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the state fund for hotel no topic acquisition is $550 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, great. That's great. And then let me also just add and again, I want to thank our our government affairs team is. Last year, actually, the city of Long Beach sponsored legislation through Senator Amberg and Senator Embry actually introduced legislation for us to kind of fast track through the secret process, motel conversion for this kind of very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'reason. And so I think that that really sets us up to be ready for this infusion of resources that's coming down from the state and and other places, obviously. And so that's another great piece of all of this as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just want to want to also just throw out some thank you to obviously the governor for supporting this work. Senator Amberg for the support of his bill last year. And certainly to our own team, to you, Mr. Curley, and our our local government affairs team for just the work and to making sure that we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'get these resources as well. So thank you to everyone. And let me turn this over to Councilman and Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. And yes, thank you again, city staff for all your hard work. I also wanted to share some incentives with you of this program. So one of the things that we are hoping to do is that the city would cover costs for maintenance and upkeep, as well as reimbursement for damages, a wear and tear and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'some ongoing cause. We would also have dedicated support and case managers from from our Health Department and human services and and also services from our homeless services team. And so that would be really helpful to to help those hotels and motels more more likely that, you know, to actually have an incentive to actually participate, especially like what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Gordon said may be, you know, really focusing on those motels that are not doing so good. And and maybe this is a way of uplifting those motels is good. It's very important that we take these steps not only right now because it's just needed, but it's really, really needed because of COVID.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just the other day, we had a horrendous event where one of our neighbors that's experiencing the homeless, Kenny, was brutally stabbed. And, you know, we cannot have our homeless neighbors living in those situations and putting themselves at risk, not ever, but especially not right now during COVID.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, again, I appreciate everybody who's supporting this this item, and I look forward to working really hard to make this a very successful pilot program. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Before I go to the public, he's he's going to hate that I do this, but I got to correct myself. It's not Mr. Curley, it's Dr. Curley. So sorry about that. He had Dr. Curly and with that good public comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our first speaker is Mark Cavaney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your time starts now. Thank you. My name is Mark Shinobi. I'd like to thank Councilwoman Zen de Haas and the other council members who cosigned us for bringing it forward. I've been a resident of District two and Long Beach for 12 years and I am in strong support of the emergency housing incentives program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I see vulnerable, unhoused residents in my neighborhood every day, and this program has the potential to immediately provide them with the safe housing they need to protect them from the COVID 19 pandemic, and also provide them with the necessary services and care to put them on a path to long term recovery.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's no secret that the COVID 19 pandemic is getting worse, not better. And as Councilman Richardson and others have pointed out, the RFP for motel acquisition funding opens in less than ten days. So this item is extremely urgent and needs to be acted upon quickly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The report back on available resources should bring back an ordinance as soon as possible that outlines a plan for the funding to be used to create permanent non congregate housing for our most vulnerable unhoused. 78% of all people experiencing homelessness in Long Beach are unsheltered, which is an 11% increase from last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': '23% of people experiencing homelessness in L.A. County are elderly, which puts them at increased risk regarding coronavirus. And let us also not forget that homelessness and the coronavirus disproportionately affects the black community in Long Beach. 13% of the population of Long Beach is black, but they make up 38% of Long Beach unhoused population.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Emergency Housing Incentives Program will have a direct, immediate and lasting impact on these populations. I urge all council members to please pass this item tonight and bring a plan back for approval as soon as possible. Please take advantage of this opportunity to help our most vulnerable unhoused neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next year, Seagrams, your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. District three. I am in full support, Stacy or Susie of this item and I hope all of you vote to pass it. Just as the person who so eloquently spoke before me stated This needs to be passed and needs to be acted on immediately.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a lot of our community members are living, unhoused and need support. Period point blank. They need support. They need our support. This gives the emergency housing incentive program gives. And so I understand 500 units of single occupancy shelter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need more than that. I mean, this is. Yes. 500 beds. Yes. But we need more. We need probably, like way more than double, if not triple that, to meet the needs of our community. We have the money, as we know, that ties back to the issue of police funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have the money if we take away the funds from the police. I know this might sound simplistic, but there is a process for this to happen. If there isn't a process created, we're acting. We're asking. You were demanding that you be creative in this moment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is what this is what this moment is asking of us to be creative, to be adaptive, and to think outside the box. Do not continue on the road that we are on. We need new options. In order to meet the needs of our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I yield my time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next year, Jordan, when your time starts now. Hi there. This is Jordan Win District two and field director for the Everyone in Lomita program. I really want to thank Council member Marion DAVIES for her hard work on the site and we worked pretty closely to help put this together and I'm really grateful for council members'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mungo Pearce and Andrews who signed on to this item as well. I'm glad that the city is taking a very proactive first step at helping really build out and amplify our infrastructure for caring for people experiencing homelessness, both in the short and long term.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I love the fact that the city is also looking proactively at the fact that this is going to help create immediate units while also looking at the long term implications and building out permanent fixtures to help aid in caring for those who are on the streets right now and most vulnerable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need 500 emergency housing units as quickly as we can get them on the ground to help aid our most vulnerable populations of people experiencing homelessness, including seniors and those with medical disabilities. As was stated earlier, 78% of all people experiencing homelessness were counted as unsheltered this year, which is 1578 people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this opportunity here to acquire motels and create these sites gives us a rare opportunity, as was noted by Theresa Chandler, to substantially reduce the number of people who are unsheltered on our streets. I do want to bring up a point of clarification on Project HOMEKEY, which is the $550 million that is set aside for motel acquisition'",
        "'speaker_2': 'by the state. I believe it was mentioned by Councilmember Richardson about, you know, developers applying or operators applying. I want to clarify that. It's it's the government plus the developers. So the municipality plus the operator that would need to apply or it could also just be the municipality, and then they can grant out the money given from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'its acquisition to developers or operators, depending on what the city so chooses. Just wanted to put that clarifying point out because the RFP will be opening up on July 15th. But keeping that deadline in mind, I do think that it is important for the city to get this item back to council as quickly as it can because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is kind of the linchpin of this program, is that $550 million in order to get those on the ground. I love the fact that councilmembers are bringing up adaptive ways to utilize these dollars. Councilmember Mongeau is completely correct in that it is important not just to have the housing but to also have the wraparound services there'",
        "'speaker_2': '. It's something that has definitely been seen and learned from the Project Roomkey site that we're currently operating in Long Beach, and I definitely want to see that continuing here in the city. So once again, thank you to all the council members.'",

So last week, Long Beach experienced an uptick in violence which revolt resulted in several shootings, including three of which occurred in the North Long Beach community. They were really across the city. And it's. You know, every every year around this time.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, I'm very concerned over the last couple of weeks, you know, the uptick in violence didn't necessarily have to happen in my district. They're happening in our city, too, that we all share and that we are all responsible for the city council members and citizens of the great city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should all be concerned. Any lives lost in our city to to violence, to gun violence is really something that we all should be concerned about and also be working to to eliminate. And I'll just say, we have not done enough over the years to do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And even though, you know, Governor Richardson recognized that this is some of the proposed items or strategies here are not new strategies with the efforts that we have put forth every year during the summer months, we want to make sure that our youth are programed in parks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we have our own BFA program that that has been, I think, very successful for a few years, several years now. But it's always a struggle to find, right, you know. COUNCILMEMBER And you mentioned the youth employment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is a strategy that we should be committed to, not this year, but every year and 365 days of the year, because we know that it's going to produce outcome. This is an investment in human infrastructure. I am supportive of this specifically, and I'm really interested in, you know, building capacity for peace, gang intervention, prevention with on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the ground engagement. It has to be grassroots and yes, it has to be considered a part of our public safety continuum as we move forward. And I'm not sure if the staff will be able to give us the answers that will be able to have the answers in, you know, a week or two weeks on how to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'get this done. But we should be, as we talk about a man down the strategy, we should be putting all of our efforts toward building capacity for for individuals in the community, on the ground, at the grassroots level to help us maintain that peace.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think there are efforts, there are models out there that that certainly can can help make a difference in many areas of our city. There were and I just want to say, I don't think as a city, we should ever get desensitized to any individuals losing their lives, particularly to violence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, I don't know all of the victims of violence over the last week, but we should be saying in their names as well, we should know their names as well. And we should be honoring their families and their lives as much as we can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I thought so I'm very excited to start on to this item, to provide the direction and to hopefully make a difference in our community. There are a few points here that I want to get some clarification on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm supportive of this item. I want to hear from my colleagues as well, and I'll come back to those points if they're not addressed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much, Councilmember. Next up here, I have. Is Councilmember Yaw Ranga then councilwoman and has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mary. And I basically want to agree with all the comments made so far about my colleagues. The one concern that I have, if there is one, is that we should really be here talking about this, especially using some funding that might eventually go away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In previous, we could go back five, ten, 20, 30 years. It's always been a problem. We've always had this issue with with the uptick in crime right around the beginning of summer and through this and throughout the summer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we had programs that would used to to deal with those. We had the DARE program. If you if we all remember, I know I'm dating myself, but I'm going to go down memory lane for a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had the DARE program, we had the PAL program, the Police Athletic League. We had Summer. You can plan a program which I participated in way back in the day. And unfortunately, because over the years we've had budget challenges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we look at these types of programs as easy, easy cuts. And we've paid the price over the years. We've paid the price also with community based organizations who are very important to receiving some of these funds and providing the services to our youth to keep them off the streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as the always said, you know, keeping our kids tired and keeping them safe. And keeping them good. So what I'm looking for, I mean, I'm totally supportive of this, the governance of this. I have no question about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I signed on to and I want to thank Cosmo Richardson for including me in this interview. That is very important. But I'm looking at sustainability. Once we we get down this path, I think we need to sustain it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think we made a mistake or this council's made a mistake in the past by cutting these programs off. And what we done is that we cut off our kids. We cut up our. We cut off our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our disenfranchized and disadvantaged communities. By not sustaining programs such as these lunch programs, camping programs, programs that that keep kids busy during the summer summer camp programs. So I hope that once we once we get going and we are able to get some of these programs back back on cue with us, that we are able to sustain'",
        "'speaker_2': 'them even after and beyond this summer and hopefully in the summers to come. So thank you again for including me on this. RICHARDSON And and and I want to just go ahead and throw in my supporters and thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman. And has. Councilman's in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In a big speech, and I didn't realize that was on me. So thank you. Thank you, Mayor. And thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this up and bringing this item forward. I. I know that there's been a horrendous amount of violence in our city in the last couple of weeks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And particularly in my district, there have been many, many shootings. And, you know, it's it's we need to do something about it. It's just disheartening. I know that a lot of us have also know about an incident that happened last week or so with, um, with one of our very beloved food vendors, Mr. Fernandez, who, you know'",
        "'speaker_1': ', earns his living by selling his delicious that lotus and blessed by those meaning his corn and shaved ice. He is a very beloved corn person, corn guy in our district. And he was beaten and robbed. And the images of a video that was caught was horrendous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I can just imagine what he had to go through. And, you know, a lot of these crimes are done on people who are very vulnerable like him. He's an older man. And, you know, he did he most likely didn't have that much cash on him.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I sometimes the violence, it's not about money. It's just about doing the the crimes. And so I think that that's very important. Another one was the case of Vanessa Guillen in in Texas, where she was a person that proudly served our nation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she was bludgeoned to death, you know, sexually harassed and and killed and left for dead. And those things, you know, those are the things that we know about. And then there's so many unsolved crimes out there. So I really, really am happy about bringing this item forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we definitely need to be proactive on not only solving the crime scene that's out there, but also in the preventive stage. So I want to thank Central specially for helping out our one of our residents that Mr. Fernandez El and just making him feel so supported by all of our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, you know, it's it's senseless acts like that that really break your heart. So thank you again, Councilmember Richardson, for this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's our Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you to Councilmember Richardson and all the councilmembers that brought this forward. I really want to. Say how heartbreaking it is for we have this violence and some of it's been my district. My district also has the shooting that happened this year on the seventh Street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we know that this is not just a moment today that we experience this, but that it's something that we constantly are struggling with. Interrupting violence, to me, means that we have to make sure that we're increasing the number of social workers that are doing the work in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It means we have to increase increased trauma services. I'm really proud that the city has developed a training for trauma informed services that hopefully not only this council and our staff but the rest of the city will receive soon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand from our health department that right before COVID hit, they were ready to start doing those trainings. I know what happened with our health department. I hope that those trainings can definitely be incorporated in centered in any of the interrupting violence work that we do when we talk about this moment around Black Lives Matter and seeing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'violence that's happening in our community with different, different groups and community groups. It's not one incident. And I want to make sure that as we're reporting out of the city and we're talking about the these moments, social media can really pop off and make it seem like they're isolated incidents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But recognizing that this is part of a bigger issue and that there are opportunities for people to become involved, to reduce that violence, to interrupt that violence. I know there are a lot of groups that have been involved with our violence prevention plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know our violence prevention plan has not been fully funded, but I also know that it's time for us to make sure that we're working with other groups. That we're working with other organizations. I don't I don't know enough about a lot of these organizations that I'm just now learning about, but it's inspiring to hear of groups'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I think there's one that's homies organized against oppression. That is a group that's been doing work. I know there are some Latino organizations that are out there that are trying to do additional work just in the community, not centered even around getting grants or dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And those are really the people that I'd love to see have an opportunity to partner with the city and make sure that they're partnering communities where we're seeing some of this violence. I really appreciate this item and want to just echo, I think, what so many people are feeling right now, which is that this is the moment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that demonstrates to us that we can do better in our schools and our colleges with our job pipeline. But particularly the one area is really around supporting people that have been through trauma because we've gone we know people have gone through 400 years of trauma and that sometimes that that boils up like this moment today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you all the council members for bringing this forward. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Austin under your personal. Thank you. So I did want to just. Go to the specifics of the item. And on a couple of points before I have a couple other statements, but direct outreach to neighborhood leaders in the most impacted communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, I signed on to this with the spirit of this 100%. I just want to make sure we have some clarity on what that actually means. And are we seeing outreach to neighborhood leaders in the most impacted communities, or do you want to look at the most impacted communities and have them direct outreach in those communities'",
        "'speaker_2': '? And I guess that's a question for the maker of the motion. Councilman, do me a favor. Can you clarify what what the distinction between the two things you said I didn't really understand? Well, what is the outreach to?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It says direct outreach to neighborhood leaders in most impacted communities. And I'm asking if we are looking to have direct staff, to have direct outreach in those communities, or are we looking for specific leaders? And how do we identify who those individuals are?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, yeah. Okay. Thank you. I understand. Yeah. I'm not calling out any specific leaders. I just think that the way that I mentioned neighborhood influencers, community groups that have influence within those communities, a number of organizations have been called out already.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, we know that, you know, when, for example, we had a tragic shooting of a vigil, people were mourning. Young lady named Dana was killed. It was a drive by was very traumatic to the neighborhood. There are organizations with direct connections to direct relationships to the families and the neighborhoods we should those are the types of folks'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we should be engaged with to make sure that we're you know, we're not we're not simply just, you know, parking a van right now. There's a van parked there with the eye in the sky that we're taking an additional step to actually go a little bit deeper into the neighborhoods that may look different in every neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think I have a prescriptive list of, let's say, neighborhood associations, but I think, you know, our balance prevention team can go back to, you know, what they've known from the three days of the grit days and some of those things and count on some of those leaders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope that clarifies. It may be coaches, it may be community based organizations. It may be churches who will engage with those local neighborhood groups. Well, I guess the point that I want to emphasize is that, again, I want I want to see this on the ground as grass roots as possible to employ that type of support'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if we're going to really impact. Safe neighborhoods in our city. And then the second one, how common was the coordination of violence prevention strategy to existing engagement efforts, including contact tracing for COVID 19 and outreach? What was your vision there for the idea?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the idea there is we may not be able to do all the things we can do traditionally if it weren't a fiscal crisis to work on COVID 19. But we know that significant outreach is about. We know that we have resources to go out and do good outreach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Contact tracing, we have to build capacity for that. So it was an example of me listing the types of things we can invest in today. How do we target some of those things to be in alignment with the right prevention strategy in a violence interruption strategy?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for example, how many people from local if people are going to be tracing down contracting contact tracing in neighborhoods? Can we hire local youth to do that? And we hire local community organizations to help with that. They have credibility in the community so that while they're engaging around COVID, while they're engaging our senses, they can also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'engage around conversations about peace and inter-racial relations and diversion and give young people an opportunity to get a job doing some of that work. So for that, the concept there is sort of aligning going with our violence interruption prevention strategy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then lastly, just want to just make sure that we're clear the deployment of a summer youth program, employment program. Now, don't we already have a summer youth program, employment program through Pacific Gateway, sir? But there are some opportunities right now above and beyond that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just talked about the Youth Ambassadors program. We know that we're about to do hiring around contact tracing and other things. So how can we expand and create some new sort of innovative employment opportunities, maybe beyond what we traditionally?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you so much. And of course, vacation. And I know that there were were others who reached out to me and they had had some concerns about that. And I would just say that, again, I'm fully supportive of this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to be more innovative. We always need to be creative when it comes to reducing the violence in our city, interrupting violence in our city. Also, we should be mindful of requires that we get the guns off of our streets because those are the tool used for so much of the violence in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, obviously, you know, we have stabbings and battery, but guns take lives and do so much damage. And I can't emphasize that enough. You know, we have young people come to the council a little over a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've seen mass shootings. We've seen, you know, shootings in our city, you know, sporadically throughout the year. But the source of that violence is guns. And we need to continue our work to get guns off of our streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will continue to be supportive of those efforts. We also need to acknowledge and and recognize the real racial tensions in our neighborhoods. Right. And again, we talk about prevention, you know, gang intervention strategies, grassroots neighborhood action.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to be mindful that we live in a very, very, very diverse city. And, you know, with with mirrors. With. Decades of history here that we need to unpack you and your listeners. And lastly, I would just say any time now to say any time a life is systematically lost to violence in our city, we should'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be outraged. Right. And and not giving in to, you know, being desensitized by this moment. So, you know, this this this item, I think, is dedicated to Archie Harris, who was was shot murdered some days ago. I think we kind of keep this off and we're having a vigil the next day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there were only three other shooting victims, including Carla. Denise, while those lives will be lost to gun violence in our city. And they were the emphasis, I think, of this item. So thank you again, Governor Richardson, for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those shootings happened on the border of our districts. I mean, right across the street. You know, we've got a district where the end of the day when one city and one community. I'll be supporting the site. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Katherine Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think we're I think we're in a good place. I think we're clear on what we what we're attempting to do. Thank you, Councilman Austin, for asking those clarifying questions and acknowledging that, you know, this is you know, there's a there's a lens of race and a lens of sort of neighborhood activity, all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'these other things that are out there that we need to be mindful of. And we also want to understand that we want to just say that we know that communities are very sensitive to what's taking place. The situation with the tragic shooting at the vigil, the stirring video of the the taco vendor that's gone viral.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we see those things. We acknowledge those things. And we need to make sure that we're doing all that we can with our grassroots community partners to make sure that we we're doing all that we can to invest in peace.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember. I'm going to just. Just briefly, before we go to public comment, I just want to say and I agree with everything that the council has said. You know, our our hearts are with the family and friends of just everyone that's been affected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, the whole city has been watching these acts of violence. And I know that our public safety officials and the city team is also doing everything they can to ensure that that those who are committing these horrific acts of violence are also responsible for those actions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are serious actions, and our community needs to be safe. And at the same time, we know that there are a lot of conditions out in the community that need to be addressed. We know that we're also dealing with racial tensions, that the challenges in front of us are real.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's a very emotional and difficult time for the entire community. But as we know, in these times of crisis, this is not the time to turn against each other with senseless acts of violence. And so as a city and as a community, we have to think about our future, the community we want to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I'm just thankful that this is a discussion that councils have having and that we're kind of bridging together, that the different aspects that are going out in the community. I want to uplift the work that's been happening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, you have champions have been talking about violence prevention in the city for a long time that have been doing that work. And I want to thank them. And we know that there's a lot of groups and it's groups like Central China and so many others that are out there as well that are doing that work'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so we're going to hear from some of them tonight. And so thanks again for bringing this forward and we'll open it up for public comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our first speaker is Anna Christiansen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your time starts now. All right. Jason, Mark, your time starts now. Hello? Can you hear me? I've worked with almost every existing black organization in the lobbies, the military, even those like the role of men, a bit like basketball that no longer exists.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In 2012, my peers and I orchestrated the ceasefire in the city of Long Beach, and violence was very minimal. Last year there was a breakout of racial violence at Lobbies Party Hard, where Hispanic gang members targeted and assaulted a black artist, a high school student and other credible members of the community kind of being able to diffuse'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and create stability between the black and Hispanic communities. We also stepped in to aid and assist the Hispanic vendor, who was also assaulted around last week by black youth in the Washington neighborhood. Not only did we publicly denounced it, but we physically stood up for that leader and his community by helping to raise over $80,000 with his'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go Fund Me to help support his family. And we're very instrumental in the black and brown peace walk from Ocean Boulevard to Artesia Boulevard last week. And it was also for intervened when there was an eruption of violence in North Long Beach where there was two homicides, one black on black and the other brown, all black homicide'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which occurred at a visual. We're again able to utilize our licenses to operate and reach out to the higher ups from both communities. Those on the street are behind the walls to influence the culture in order to keep retaliations at heights of trauma of others caused by systemic institutional racism and misguided societal behaviors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To a minimum, this requires very tedious late night and early morning hours of diplomacy meet up and see dangers which cannot be quantified by data. However, it takes community trust, credibility and respect for peers across all quarters in order to implement any outside violence against a rupture practices that create any form of health and wellness in our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'community as a whole if it is to be sustainable. I respect the work of Central China. I personally have great relationships with the ministers of the black community but have never discussed. And as I told them, by sending numbers and statistics over the last 15 or 20 years, their outreach has done nothing to enhance or develop the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'quality of life of the black community. Perhaps this is due to a limited reach and credibility within the heart of the black community. After over 15 to 20 years of the black community, you'll see that we're at the bottom of every statistical category according to data and research in the city of Long Beach, and this is under'",
        "'speaker_2': 'their watch. So it is imperative to immediately power those who have the total community trust and credibility to assist with the stabilizing and revitalization of the black community. Therefore, we must implement a holistic, community driven process. We can't afford to rush in a reduction when approaching promised progress in our community restoration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We must implement practitioner based strategies to build an infrastructure that has already been successfully replicated not only in the county of Los Angeles, California, other community led organizations, the mayor offices throughout the United States, but also successfully replicated internationally in countries such as France, Argentina, El Salvador, Africa and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know this because I was certified by a big practitioner, instructor and a first responder from the city of Long Beach for over 40 years, and the only grassroots organization that has globally achieved this through the aforementioned practices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That concludes public comment for this item.'",

Recommendation to request City Manager to engage California State Lands Commission regarding potential modifications to the oil barrel production tax request. City Attorney to prepare all necessary documents to place a ballot question on the November 2020 ballot for an increase in the oil barrel production tax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And request city manager and City Attorney to explore the feasibility of preparing a ballot advisory question on whether to reinvest future cannabis revenue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Cook I'm going to make a few just opening comments. I know that the Council is queued up to to discuss and make comments, so I'll be fairly brief, but I just want to make some overarching comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted just a little a little context. Obviously. I think that as we know that from a timing perspective, the council is going to consider anything for the November ballot. Now is the time to consider those and trying to give the city attorney enough time to bring what a ballot measure would actually look like in front'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the city council. So that's why this is being discussed. So the in line, which we have, of course, an oil barrel production tax, it's a common in cities that have this industry. We know that here locally, the last time that this tax was raised was about ten years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, it was part of a proposal by our city auditor, Laura Dowd, who increased and took to voters an increase of $0.25 to the oil production tax. Back then, it was 11 years ago that passed the voters and at the time it was put in place for public safety services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in fact, we still see those to this day. We know that in Long Beach, the oil for the oil barrel production tax is $0.47. You look at our neighbor in Signal Hill and it's at $0.67. And so there certainly is a difference between us and and our local our local neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These taxes just for the council discussion are not taxes on residents. So local residents, of course, don't pay into this. It's directly on oil barrel production and essentially is on companies that that that produce oil. But in addition it's also on those that that see revenue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if you include the state of California, the city of Long Beach, which also, of course, the oil revenue are also part of the overall production pie as it relates to revenues. And we concern it just broadly speaking, obviously, you think about Long Beach is as a leader on climate, we've been doing a lot of great work'",

        "'speaker_3': 'We've been aggressive in those areas, but we also know that we have had and continue to have in the city a debate about the future and quite frankly, debates happening across the country as far as what's the sustainability and the dependance on oil here locally at home as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know this is a very this market is unstable. We can see where the prices are today versus where they were years ago or or years before that. And so we know that this is just a piece of that conversation, but it's one that I think we should have in this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's an opportunity for us to reinvest in issues around climate justice, around equity and health, around the work happening, around the framework. And so I think this will be a it's a good discussion to have, and it's certainly not it certainly comes with precedent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there's something that the city has increased, you know, over over the years, the last time being ten years ago, when we look at this time to look at it again. And I want to thank everyone that's been involved in the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With that, I'm going to turn this over to Councilmember Richardson, who has a motion, and then I'll go through the list of of members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to start just acknowledging that we have a great city. We talk about it all the time. We speak about it all the time. You know, downtown on the waterfront, largest port in the United States, great educational institutions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're also a city with deep, deep economic health and environmental divides. And we have to do better to change our systems and invest in equity. We're at a critical point in our history, the history of our city, the history of our nation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have an equity mandate in front of us, calling on all local governments to recommit to structural investment investments into equity programs, governments at all levels. I've heard from community that they expect more from us specifically as it relates to the investments that we make, our commitment to equity and addressing inequality in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This call to action from the from the public is why the City Council moved to embark on the framework for reconciliation four steps acknowledging, listening, convening and catalyzing action where we're in the process of concluding the listening process over the next week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we begin the process of shaping recommendations immediate, short term, medium term, long term for action for the City Council. And we know the staff have done a good job. I applaud their efforts to engage with community and we think staff are meeting the commitment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we started this we said, Hey, make sure that you keep us in alignment to not miss the opportunities for this November. The staff has come to us and let us know what that timeline is, which has prompted this this conversation tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to be clear that this item isn't meant to undercut or diminish the framework process. We're continuing with that and we're making great progress and we're going to take a look. We should be in a position in a matter of weeks, not months, to begin taking action, but rather we are complementing that by making sure that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we meet these critical deadlines that have the resources necessary to actually take meaningful, meaningful action to advance equity. As we discussed, discussed tonight's actions. It's a this is a process of us asking to prepare and engage with stakeholders on a source of revenue to actualize many of the things that are coming to light throughout this framework process'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and will be further informed by it. In addition, there's additional actions that require other processes to take place concurrently, like our budget. So let's get started. Let's go to the next slide. So today's recommendation has three parts. First, we're asking the city manager engage with State Lands Commission and other stakeholders regarding the modification of the oral burial'",
        "'speaker_2': 'production tax. I want to be clear. Other ideas may come up from this. So we want to you know, we want to really listen to what folks have to say because it may inform what what ultimately goes on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Secondly, we want to request the city attorney to prepare all necessary documents to place a ballot question on the 2020 ballot for an increase in the oil production tax. Third, we want to explore the feasibility of preparing a ballot advisory question on whether to reinvest future cannabis revenue into economic equity, health equity and youth investment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next oil. We have a long history, a little bit of context. We have a long history of oil in our city. From 1911 when the state placed all of its all of its state lands within the city limits.'",
        "'speaker_2': '1932, when when oil when discovered oil was discovered in Wilmington oil field. And for the past 60 years, pipelines has been restricted to Titan's area, making it difficult to invest resources into other parts of the city that are also affected by oil related industries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pipelines goes into services like police and fire lifeguards, beach maintenance, lease management, parking operations, a whole host of investments. And 27 Long Beach voters approved Prop eight. That's the police and fire public safety oil production tax to increase the barrel tax on oil producers to support public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was the legal strategy the more broadly invest outside of the titans by taxing oil production. That is the legal way to invest in the entire city utilizing the oil production tax to fund service. So this is not a new concept.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's the point. In fact, public safety departments still receive funding for oil production taxes that were approved 13 years ago. Although the city's an operator of our domestic oil production, we operate as a trustee of the state. Because of this dynamic, we are engaging with state lands and that is a part of this motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had a very productive talk just this afternoon as chair of State led with the staff from the from SLC. They were very open to talking with us. They were very appreciative that we spoke with them and they look forward to the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was a very productive discussion. We have a meeting next week with the lieutenant governor as a member of the commission. She was very open and willing to have a talk. She's one of three members of the State Lands Commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So these are very productive conversations. And above all, this is an opportunity to leverage funding to advance health and environmental equity that includes climate investing, youth programs, the resources and address the economic issues that have been raised within our communities that have been historically left out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's go to the next slide. So so we have a unique opportunity to respond to the disparities impacting, you know, the North and the northwest, the southwest parts of our of our city. The areas that are impacted by environmental challenges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That map on the left shows Long Beach residents where Long Beach residents live by race and ethnicity. Asian Pacific Islander, Latino black residents live northwest, the southwest part of our city and greater concentration to the right. You see the Carolyn Biro screen that reveals that those neighbors, those same neighborhoods, are exposed to higher concentrations of pollutants, which'",
        "'speaker_2': 'also happen to be in northwest and southwest parts of the city. I didn't include a map of household income levels where they live, but the correlations are the same. Low income communities of color are concentrated in portions of the city that have the worst air quality and environmental health metrics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Near the port adjacent, the 1791 corridors in our industrial corridor. These neighborhoods have fewer open space or green space options. They're on some of the largest environmental waste generators means of color in Long Beach already experience health disadvantages, such as higher rates of asthma, heart disease, diabetes, low birth weight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These environmental health disparities are also apparent in the overrepresentation of African-Americans, Latinos and positive COVID 19 cases and hospitalizations. More. Additionally, with respect to cannabis, in 2016, the state of California legalized recreational cannabis, followed by Long Beach, passing ordinances on both medicinal and adult use cannabis in 2016 2018, which includes a cap on 32 dispensaries in light'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the legalization of cannabis as well as the adoption of cannabis, social equity programs are steps in the right direction. There are still equity issues that exist in the in the high cost of entering into the industry and that it continues to exclude many communities of color.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These communities have been impacted by the war on drugs that's left a long standing impacts like loss of property, disqualification from employment opportunities, reduced earning potential exclusion from public benefits and other negative impacts. The night's item offers an opportunity to explore to buyers requesting that cannabis revenue back into communities and retool to invest in ownership opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We may or may not the council may or may not move forward this question. We understand that, you know, there would be there are ways that we can achieve this without action on the ballot. But we want to make sure we head down this direction and we can make that decision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whether to move forward on this part or not based on additional research will do on what we can access the council meeting next. Like really this this is a great opportunity for us. It's an opportunity for us and we don't have to start from scratch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have you know, we can fund key areas where we know inequity persists. Our research and engagement has already been done on a lot of this. Now is the time that allocate resources, support the findings and drive change as it relates to youth development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city department has published the safe Long Beach Violence Prevention Plan. We discussed it tonight. We need to fund these things and fund you. We're in the we're engaged in a youth strategic plan process and the Parks and Rec Department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Both of these plans employ collective action approaches to understanding gaps and opportunities for our youth. Early, early intervention. This is an opportunity to make a real commitment to our youth and a world class youth development operation in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next, you'll see under as it relates to environmental health equity, we are in the process of establishing our first ever climate action adaptation plan, and we're reminded of the various impacts of climate change on our low income neighborhoods, kids of color, their ability to respond and adjust.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Long Beach Community Health Community Health Assessment also called out health and quality of life disparities facing disadvantaged communities. Investing in programs like Black Infant Health, Climate and environmental education, placemaking infrastructure that improve health outcomes in the most impacted neighborhoods are types of the types of things that we can we can address.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then as it relates to the economy, we know that we have tools. We've done the research over the last few years and work like everyone in economic empowerment zones, our digital inclusion roadmap. We know that we understand the disparities as relates to how our communities, the economic divide within our communities and the strategies move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've already adopted these things. We've lacked the resources to invest in it. These are things like investing in and opportunities to make sure folks who buy homes, small business support, teen workforce centers all of these things are things that we can move forward if we have the resources to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's go to the final flight. So, so close. Number one, it's not this is not a new taxes proposal. It's not a tax among these. Rather, this is an opportunity to align our oil production tax with neighborhoods, neighboring cities, and invest in areas where are in the issues where our disparities exist.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's an opportunity to align funding with our city's current priorities. This is an opportunity to have a world class youth development strategy make a real difference as it relates to our health, climate and environmental issues, and also make real steps to close the economic divides of our cities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our next steps engaged California State Lands Commission and other stakeholders regarding the potential modifications engaged community partners such as the Best Youth Coalition around what the resolution may look like for this next report. Back to the City Council in time for us to give direction in order to get it over the November 30 ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to add that we also want to make sure that we evaluate options to create an oversight mechanism that can look like aligning with an existing commission or creating or creating some other oversight mechanism to make sure that we're continuing to invest these resources in equity as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that is my my presentation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I know that was a motion seconded by Councilmember Pearce. That's our.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. I appreciate all the work that's gone into this. This motion, this concept of being able to at least get at par with our oil tax, with our neighboring cities. We know that right now we're in a historic moment where we have lifted up the systemic issue of racism that we have not given enough time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to in the future and in the past. We know that we are living at a time when our climate continues to deteriorate as much as we have been a leader in things like electrification and trying to bring in new EV charging stations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also know that. Time is running out. Some of you guys might have followed me online. I am taking sustainability classes at UCLA right now, so I'm bombarded when I'm not in council with the reality that even if we did everything that we needed to do today, that the effects of what we've already done are going to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be lasting into our great grandchildren. And so I'm continually feeling the urgency of figuring out a way to inspire us to act on a bigger scale with our climate. And when I dove into the numbers and recognize that the number one cause of death for people in our community is not police violence, even though that is the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'most violent and atrocious because we see it and we know that we are paying out our community members to not have that happen. The number one killer is diseases that are caused by pollution and other issues around our heat islands, around poor water quality, around lack of access to food because of food deserts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so when I see this item, I see all the buckets that Councilmember Richardson has talked about. But I really talk about climate, not only because it's a tax on oil, but the reality is that the market for oil is going down and that when the cost of oil goes down, it's not necessarily great for our climate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and the cost of oil goes down. It means that it's difficult for people that have been living below their means to access, whether it's electric cars or green energy on their home, whether it's solar or whether it's retrofitting that it's important for us to make sure that that that gap is thin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when that happens, we're able to see more investments in clean energy. And we as a city can play a role in making sure that we're using this this pocket of money to create new renewable opportunities, to create more opportunities for solar, to do a home retrofit program that has a jobs component.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Some of you know, I've been very busy talking to everyone from Black Lives Matter, to people in the labor movement to organizations in Los Angeles that have dealt with how we close this gap. And they've all been supportive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm really happy to see, at least on one letter, there's 15 organizations that have signed up to say that they support this and several community members. So I support all the buckets and making sure that we get to the highest payroll tax that we can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that the $0.67 mark is an important mark for us. I think making sure that we have an oversight commission is absolutely critical and we know this idea has been talked about over the years, but we really saw a window on an opportunity right now to move quickly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I know that some people haven't been able to be fully involved in the conversation, but I'm hopeful that that will change now that this vote has happened or will happen. And I want to make sure that we have public process in the meantime, where we're talking about the opportunities for the jobs pipeline, for health impacts, and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'making sure that those that are most impacted by our poor air quality are along the 710 and the 91 are the ones that can have access to the benefits of increasing this tax. So I am very supportive. I'm very thankful for the mayor and Councilmember Richardson's work on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I look forward to hearing from our community stakeholders that are going to speak on this item as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And also, before I move on, I have Councilmember Austin next. Before I move on, just want to clarify also that this is a this is a all about production taxes. It's a general tax would not be a special tax.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just wanted to clarify that. And the city attorney was asking and so just to clarify that as well. Let me move on to Council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you to Mr. Mayor. And I believe this item also of to a cannabis. Question on the ballot, potential ballot as well. I think we should also give some attention to that. But I'm pleased to sign on to this item because it makes me feel good about this measure of poor oil production tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It makes fiscal sense for us at this time and makes good timing sense. It makes sense from a community justice standpoint, from a fiscal sense. Our residents are demanding more investments in programs to address disparities and inequities that affected our communities of color for far too long.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is systemic change and greater investment in and community in, particularly the black community. Given the budget constraints we are facing in the coming year, identifying new revenue sources makes sense. Oil production tax is not a direct impact on our residents, especially our communities, and we're trying to help make a difference in November by putting it on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the November ballot and if it's approved by the voters, will be able to start investment funds within a matter of months to benefit our revenue by dedicating funds to programs that support our youth economic opportunity and health and environmental equity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're committing to our residents that we have been have been disproportionately affected by the health crisis, academic, economic impacts and lack of opportunities for our youth. I strongly support the goal to ask our residents to vote on this investment in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do have a couple of questions regarding the other part of this item. And of course, I signed on to it as a code. But there and again, I think most of this makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to understand that that, you know, putting forth ballot initiative is also a cost for the city. And the and as I understand it, the part regarding cannabis and perhaps, you know, the interesting thing to clarify, but the part regarding cannabis, cannabis is meant to be advisory or only an advisory measure, a question to the voters'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of and that of revenue and revenues the city already receives from a measure, and they are a general tax, from what I understand. So the Council can already vote to allocate some of the revenues of that program already for measure or may without an advisory measure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not mistaken. And so I guess the question is, what about it? I've seen a while of having an advisory measure. Measure is there rather than part of the budget process or framework of the reconciliation. We see community input about investing a portion of these residents, these revenues from cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope you guys got that. You know, so basically, are we are is this going to be too damaged, spending this extra money for a question to the voters that we as a city council already have the ability to to move?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess I put that question to you, Mr. Richardson. Okay. Thank you, Councilmember. You're absolutely right. So we're you know, we're in the process of obviously exploring what we can and cannot do get in one of the cannabis laws measure M require to go to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kind of the the are on recreational adult use did not. It seems like we can probably get to this without the ballot question. So if I go so far as to say it was strategic, this was included strategically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we may not need we may be able to abandon this at the end if we as we kind of research and learn a bit more, the timeline for this, the timeline for the framework of running concurrently, the listing process ends this week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should expect, you know, in a matter of weeks, not months, for recommendations. And that process might play out in front of the council. And that's when we will know very clearly about what our options are. So I agree with you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If there's a way for us not to have to do this and save a little bit money, we can. And I think we'll get to that point when this comes back to council. Okay. Thank you so much that that's my comment for now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, I support moving forward with this with the question mark on the cannabis question. And you know, I'm sure a staff research it wants to put this together. We can we can make a decision down the line. Within the next couple of weeks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much, Councilwoman and House. Councilwoman in the house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You may. You can hear me, right? Yes. First of all, thank you to Councilmember Richardson for bringing this item forward. I think it's very, very important. I share the same sentiments as my colleagues, and I look forward to to the development of this item and putting it on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hopefully, we are we are headed to some very, very difficult times when it comes to talking about our budget. I think it's going to bring this item would bring additional revenue to service our communities that are so much in critical need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm fully supportive of this item. And, you know, it's going to be something really good that the public will actually have the opportunity to vote on. And I think that whenever we have the public be able to vote on something, I think that's very powerful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you again for all the hard work that's done on this already. Councilmember Richardson and all those who've signed on to it as well. It's important to make sure that our budget reflects our values here in the city, and I really think that this is an important step in doing that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Q Mr. Mayor, and thank you to my council colleagues who brought this item. I think this is a very productive discussion. I think it's an opportunity that's definitely worth exploring. I do have a few questions and I also think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, let me just let me ask that some of the questions I have, and then I'll come back to that. So in regards to the item, I really in my opinion, I don't think the cannabis piece is essential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that we have flexibility with our current structure to allow or some policy decisions to be made regarding the expenditure of those funds. I am curious when we're talking about cannabis as a revenue source. I know the last time we received an update.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The revenues were falling far shorter than what we had expected. Mr. Modica, do you have an update on that revenue source?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if so, we will as part of the budget process? We're looking at that right now. My general sense is that it's doing better than it was last year. So we always knew this was going to be a lagging revenue source where it takes a couple of years to build.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are now seeing more dispensaries on board and so we do expect some revenue to be increasing from this, from that, the exact amount we'll have in a couple of weeks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. But I do think that we have some opportunity there. Maybe the city attorney could weigh in on this. I mean, is it necessary for us to expand 3 to $400000 to put this on the ballot? Or is the city infrastructure in place to allow the council to weigh in on how those revenues would be expended'",
        "'speaker_1': ', given the language in May, as the city attorney can the city attorney weigh in on that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member this is Charlie Parker. And you're correct. And I think Councilmember Richardson said it, too, that you have in place during the budget process that revenue is coming in and is currently allocated under the budget and could be reallocated by the Council during the budget process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. So good. It sounds like we're all kind of in alignment on that. That was one question I had when I was reading the item. So I'm glad we had some clarification for Mr. Modica. Is this a tax?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that Mr. Madison I talked to off line about this, but I have received quite a few questions from residents as well as some oil operators as I have several of them in my district. So would this be a tax that would be placed on local producers?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the way the oil barrel tax works is, it's essentially a tax on those who are producing the oil in Long Beach and it becomes a unit expense of the oil field. So it is ultimately paid by the person who has the mineral rights as one of the operating expenses of the field.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And does the city have the mineral rights for any of the fields that are operating right now?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So about 94% of the funds that, you know, that would be spent are come from the state of California. And of that pot, the city has a portion of that where we get some interest in tidelands. We also get some upland.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we would pay a portion of this. The state pays the vast majority of this. And then some of the other operators that have oil interests and mineral rights would pay that as well, as well as anyone who else who owns little fractions of oil.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do have some of those in our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when the report comes back, will it outline what the city's obligation would be if there were a change to the rate?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, we would take a look at, you know, what what this could generate. I believe the item is to have us look at a number of different, you know, factors and then come back with a recommendation. And we would certainly do a financial analysis as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Because obviously, it would need to make financial sense for us since we would be responsible for some of the some of the tax obligation as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. The other question that I had is I know there's a request for communication and outreach with stakeholders. Are we including oil operators, local oil operators and producers in the city as part of the stakeholders? And will we be doing outreach with them?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we haven't designed that process yet. I think we wanted to hear from counsel. We can certainly ask those who are, you know, kind of the bigger players. We're only going to have, you know, a couple of weeks at most to bring everything back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be happy to talk to anyone who is a person who is affected by payment of the tax. It's going to be a pretty small group. Since this isn't a tax and it doesn't tax our population, it really has a limited group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we'd be happy to talk to anyone who has an interest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so I'd like to add a friendly I'm not sure who made the motion, but to the maker of the motion, I'd like to add a friendly that the oil producers who would be subject to this tax be included in the stakeholder outreach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member, my understanding is only three potentially. So that's a synergy signal, Hill Petroleum and CRC. And so they've already they've already engaged with the city. And so I don't know that we need to put it into the into the motion to call out specific companies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think in general saying stakeholders. I think that broadly says if they're paying into this, they are a stakeholder and they're already used the manager, the flexibility with them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That that's fine. The reason I made the friendly is because I received calls from them today. They didn't know anything about it. So I just want to make sure they got that. At least all of these stakeholders, every single one of them, is involved in the outreach process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if that friendly is denied, I appreciate that. But it was just meant to be inclusive. So hopefully the city manager can hear that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think city manager, I think I think under the current motions in front of us, I think you have that flexibility to do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Price And now we can talk to to those groups for sure. And if you have any others, let us know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll do. Thank you. And then in terms of the Tidelands Fund, Mr. Modica, can you please explain the impact, if any, of this ballot measure, if it were to pass on the existing tidelands funds that we utilize for capital and infrastructure projects in the Tidelands area and also for operation of services in the Tidelands area, including police'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and fire.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we'll know that a little bit more in specificity when we come back. My general sense is it's going to be pretty minimal. We would probably be looking at a, you know, something in the range of a, you know, ten cent, 2010, 30 cent, maybe 40 cent increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't know yet. We have to calculate that. And each $0.10 is about $1,000,000 and the state is probably about 60% of that revenue. And the city is, you know, in the 15 to 20%. So our share is going to be pretty small.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We would certainly do our best to estimate what that impact would be, but we don't expect a big impact on on existing projects. There might be a slight reduction in some of the Tidelands revenue, but ultimately we will have more revenue in the general fund net because we would be taxing, you know, the state of California would'",
        "'speaker_5': 'be paying a big portion of this, as would a couple of others.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So when the report comes back, is it going to include a breakdown of how it would impact current existing enterprise funds like the Children's Fund?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, we would do a financial impact of what it would mean for the general fund and what it would mean for Tidelands. Those are the two big funds that would be impacted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then the Tidelands Fund has currently has some restrictions on where that money can be spent and what for for what purposes would that restriction remain in effect? And those tidelands funds still be limited for that purpose?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's my understanding that when we do a citywide tax, it becomes a a general fund revenue. That's how we do it with sales tax. So for example, sales tax in the of sales in the Tidelands becomes a general fund revenue if it's applied citywide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's something we'd work with our attorney, but we that's how the tax has been applied in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that's the tax portion. It's not the tidelands portion that we currently use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For this trial. That's correct. That the Tidelands portion has to remain in the Tidelands, as Tom explained as a tax. It is not considered restricted by the Titans fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So all the oil money that we normally get from Tidelands would not be affected. Just whatever that tax amount is that is increased would become general fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. That sounds good. And then the other question that I had is, is there any tax opportunity for oil that is imported into the city? You know, the tankers that we see out there filled with oil. Is there any tax revenue opportunities on those sources of oil?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we currently get some franchise fees. We'd have to look into that a little bit more. We do get franchise fees for certain pipelines that are in the ground that we have an interest in, and that is part of our general fund revenue stream.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Typically, the taxing of imports into the United States is a federal issue rather than a local issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Is that something that can be definitively studied and reported back on is is imported oil and whether the city has any sort of opportunity to. Exercise any options in regards to tax revenue on that? I agree with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe it is a federal issue, but is that something that can be definitively researched and included?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If that's the will of the council, we can do that. They would probably not. That's going to take a little bit more time. We we wouldn't be able to do that within the 30 days. We can do the initial research, but maybe not a full proposal, but we can look at that if that's the will of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I mean, I think that I think it would be a fairly simple question. I mean, if it's a federal issue, then the city wouldn't have jurisdiction to impose any tax burden on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we can do that high level analysis. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Because if it's not an option that it's not an option, then you don't have to go any deeper. But I'm just interested to know is does the city have any standing to impose tax on imported oil since we do have a port in the city and we do are source of receipt of a lot of imported'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oil. So I think the answer to that question is that it's a federal government standing and not a city standing. But if it requires further research from that, then maybe you can report on that and we can require further action on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Yes, we can report on that high level question and then it'll be more of a nuance question about franchise fees. That gets pretty complicated. So we'll do our best to answer both those questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. I have nothing else. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Captain Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, and I appreciate all the commentary from my colleagues. The one thing I do like about this coming forward is that the fact that it will include some kind of oversight of those funds, and I think that's wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It would be an opportunity for the community to keep abreast as to how we're spending those funds. Once it starts generating, of course they need to pass first. But so I'll be very supportive of the settlement. Thank you for bringing it forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo. Woman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now. Yes. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, wonderful. Thank you. Thank you for bringing this item. It's important to kind of talk through some of the high level things. A lot of those questions have been fleshed out. But what I think it's also important to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think it's also important to kind of recognize is that the price of oil is that. By the market. And so it doesn't necessarily mean that this tax is passed on to the consumers. I will say that when we added some fees at the airport a few years ago, I don't think any of us could have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'predicted that the largest share of the fees would be burdened by one hotel or one user or one person. And so when we look at this, I'm really interested in seeing this protocol. You said 65% would be paid by the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_1': '15% would be paid by the city. And then of that remaining, 25%. I hope that it doesn't fall on one provider. I know Mr. Richardson stated that there are three providers and one would hope that. It's not being burdened just by one company the way that some of the other feeds have kind of turned out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that that wasn't done in a way to harm any particular company. I think it was an unintended consequence of a policy that when the information came back to the council, that level of analysis wasn't included.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so while I'm not here to ask the specifics of any of those three companies, I think it's important for us to know whether or not any one company is going to be taking a burden that's significantly larger than the other two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I don't know what the production levels like, and I also don't know if every year the percentages that come out are the same or if there are various volatility and variability of their production makes that difference. So is that something that you think a quick high level could be included?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. We can report back on what the the users are a bit of the Long Beach unit and then some of the private just in general how many barrels per per day that they produce. So the numbers I gave were kind of rough swags.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You'd be happy to kind of show you what that actually looks like in terms of barrels produced.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then when it comes to the marijuana side of the discussion, I appreciate Mr. Austin and Mr. Price's discussion. It is something that we can do at the council level. I just would like to remind us that we were sitting at the dais not four months ago, reducing taxes on marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now that everyone has gotten up and running and a lot of these facilities are at full steam ahead, I don't know that the stated objective of the reduction in the tax has actually come to fruition. I don't see that we've had any additional applications or any of those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think that it's a good time to restore what the community asked for. In terms of the question of what level tax should be at. And I think that that's important, at least in my discussions with some of the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Individuals that are in that industry. They want some certainty. They don't want us coming to the table and reducing and then increasing and then inducing and increasing. And the same is true of what that does for the market around them and the customer base.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think it's important for us to set a standard and if we want to have an escalation over time or a rebound of what changes things in the future, I think we just need to come up with some policies that are consistent and forth and very transparent to that group of individuals so that they know what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're working with as a business owner. The most harmful thing that they're facing these these times is the uncertainty of so much. And so to add another component of uncertainty, in my opinion, would be not great for the industry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think that we need to work with everybody to come up with what that could look like. Other than that, those are my comments. And thank you for my colleagues for their openness to discussing and understanding the depth of impact of this before we make what could be a very impactful decision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then I think I'll just add one additional question. Mr.. MODICA It's my understanding that the amount we pull out of oil, out of the resource over time is going to be declining. So we would be theoretically creating a new revenue stream that would decline over time and eliminate itself.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct. The number of oil barrels produced declines about 8 to 10% every year. And then at times we get large investment and it actually goes back up and then it tends to decline over time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so at the the highest level, $0.40, we're talking about $4 million a year. And then it would go down theoretically at 8% a year until a potential investment came. And then theoretically, it could pop back up. But we're never talking about large amounts of money of more than 4 billion a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the oil side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From the oil bear attacks. It's it's I don't have the exact numbers. It's roughly in that in that range. Okay. It doesn't go up. It's huge amounts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I'm going to go to you before I go to Consul Richardson and then also then to the public. Just as a as a just a perfect nation, I think there are three major companies. But there are more than three companies, I think, that are involved in this work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are some small, smaller operators as well. And I wanted to clarify that as well for the council, the public. So, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I think it was a good discussion by the council. I want to take a minute and just acknowledge the letters that have come in today in support letters from Senator Gonzalez. Dr. Benitez, come on, girls in action.'",

Now, I understand that there are some political maneuvering that has to happen. I understand that everybody has to talk about incremental change and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this is about the environment. And ultimately, unless we act quickly, we're not going to leave the planet behind for our kids. And so I do support this item now as we think about, okay, if we were to tax the fossil fuel industry out of existence, what about the jobs of the people in that industry?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, we should also be talking about a just transition process to a green economy, and that is part of this conversation.

        "'speaker_2': 'paying taxes with their lives. Air pollution is a big reason why black and brown folks have short lifespans. And so as we tax these big oil producers out of existence, it's important that the revenues go to the black and brown communities.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Third, local nonprofits and community benefit organizations that work to organize, educate or provide direct services to disadvantaged communities should receive some of these funds. Lastly, these investments should yield quantifiable benefits via air quality public health or economics to the community, as well as avoid harming the community and the population currently in place.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Would the existing county ordinance, which also imposes an eviction moratorium, apply to any tenancy tenancies sorry, in Long Beach? And everyone, if they don't know, should know that there is an existing Los Angeles County ordinance which applies to tenancies in the unincorporated, unincorporated areas of the county.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it also applies to cities that do not have moratoriums in place, but cities that do have moratoriums in place are exempt from the county ordinance. So Long Beach currently has such a thing in place. But if it were not to come August 1st, it is not entirely clear to me that the county ordinance would for sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'apply to Long Beach tenancies, and I think a lot of people are assuming that it would, and therefore the expiration of the Long Beach eviction moratorium would not have a significant impact on Long Beach tenants. I'm sorry that I don't have a clear answer for you on whether it would apply or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's it's I didn't have time to really bottom that out, but I just want to let everyone know we will be doing that. Our office will be doing that over the next couple of weeks, but we should not move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Assuming that the county ordinance would necessarily apply if the Long Beach ordinance expired. Its second thing, if it did if it did expire, I'm sorry. If it did apply. So if the Long Beach I'm sorry, the Long Beach City ordinance expired and the county ordinance did apply, it wouldn't necessarily cover all of the tenancies that the city'",
        "'speaker_2': 'one did, because while the ordinances are very similar to one another, they are not exactly the same. And that might lead to some incompatible application of the two ordinances to the same tenancy. One would be covered in, one wouldn't, which would be legal, but it would be odd and maybe a bit cumbersome.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second thing I wanted to note, and this is noted, I think in the letter and this is the final note I'll make is that Governor Newsom recently extended one of his executive orders, which suspends the application of certain state laws which would prohibit cities from enacting eviction moratoriums.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In short, any city in the state can but is not obligated to extend its eviction moratorium through September 30th of this year, subject to further executive orders. And with that, I'm happy to take any questions and look forward to the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Just first, thanks to city staff. City Council asked that a periodic basis before the eviction moratorium expire that you have not given us an opportunity to weigh in on what we want to do so we don't have to continue what's not on the agenda ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My thoughts here are that we've moved in alignment with L.A. County. I want to thank you for the excellent explanation of what the county is doing. I want to what I think the right thing to do here in this place is engage with the county directly, see what they're going to do if they take action or don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'take action. I want to hear from from Mr. Mayor that we can, if needed, we can pull a special meeting together at a later date, within this month, prior to the end of the moratorium, to take action if we need to in terms of aligning with the county.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Mayor, is that something that we can do?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. We'll be having a special meeting later this month, to my perspective, to address the oil tax burial tax measure as well. So there will be a special meeting and an opportunity of the council wants to take action later this month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that makes I think that makes sense and gives us some time to engage. Because, you know, when you have the conversation about if they moratoriums the it triggers the conversation about extended repayment periods and resources this so a large conversation that we need to make sure that we're we're in alignment with the county.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would say that's the direction we should go and that would be my motion receive on file this tonight we're engaged to see where the county's going and then come back, you know, at a later date, you know, prior to end of the month so we can take action.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That's the motion. There's a second by Councilmember Pearce. Councilor Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. I agree with this direction. I know that we've had a lot of conversations. I would want to make sure that the motion is very clear, that it's been filed, a staff report today, and that it's directing the city attorney to prepare an ordinance for council consideration in late July, which would amend our muni code'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at that time. And so I definitely want to make sure that that's just clear. Councilmember Richardson, is that clear that something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is if what I want to make sure is city staff or rich city attorney. So when we say I'll come back at a later date with, you know, perhaps a special meeting for the in the month. The idea is if we're going to take action to expand the urgency ordinance, we want it noticed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In that way, we can go into effect immediately. That makes sense. Yes. This is rich. So what I want to make sure I do get before I don't I don't know what I'm bringing back exactly in the very end of July.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would like to get I mean, I think I know, but I don't want to guess. I want the council to give me explicit direction on what you expect to see in the ordinance that I bring back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm afraid and I know no one likes to hear this just because it makes it just start up agenda items. But I think we need to agenda items. At some point we're going to need a discussion and direction given to the city attorney's office to bring back an ordinance with specific detail on what you want to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'see in that ordinance. And then the second meeting hopefully will be a quick one, because I'll bring back exactly what you told me to bring back, and then you will actually have an up or down vote on that ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You don't have to give me the specific instruction tonight, but I'm afraid that you will have to give me specific instruction, perhaps on July 14, assuming I think I know there's no meeting on the 21st. And so I need we're going to have to have that conversation at some point before the special meeting on July, whatever it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going to be. 28, 29, 30th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I believe I still have the the floor, so I will. You know, I went straight into the motion. I want to say that, you know, the county might extend. They might not extend. It's important, as Councilmember Richardson says, that we go along with it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that there's, you know, a. Different opinions of whether we should move forward or not or how we move forward. I think that a lot of us in the community and on the council are exhausted about bringing these items forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have to have two votes every council, every time that we bring it forward every month. And it would be my hope that we would be able to act swiftly, act in a manner that gives the city attorney direct, you know, direction, that says just come back at the end of the month so that we know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what the county is doing and align it at the end of the month with the county. And we can vote at that time whether we move forward or not, bringing something on the 14th, then at the end of the month, then another reading at the beginning of the following month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's just a lot. And I know that I've talked to people, you know, like Jeremy Harris at the Chamber as well as some of our other community members. And a lot of folks, I think, would appreciate a simpler process as we continue to move forward this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, you know, I I know that Councilmember Richardson has spoke at this point, that I really would encourage us to be able to give clear direction to the city attorney, as he's asking, so that we can set up that next process and not have eight more meetings about it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I might queue up again. I'm curious to hear what my council colleagues have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Before I before I continue, just wanted to clarify. So, I mean, the way I interpret Councilman Richardson's motion is to receive and file and to then obviously continue engaging with the county to assess what the county's next step is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, of course, keeping in mind that if the county moves in a certain direction, there's got to be enough time for the council to react. If the council chooses to make a policy decision based on any additional action the county the county would take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And obviously we would work with the attorney or anything else to give the council the opportunity to do that. And so Mr. Anthony obviously will ensure that that happens. But I understand the motion that's being made, which is to receive and file and to give us time to see what what happens over the next few weeks with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the county. So let me go out to Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think you're right, Mr. Mayor. I think that's pretty simple and straightforward what you just described. That's that's the idea. You know, once we understand what they're going to do, we do have time to come back and do it by the end of the month, which is the spirit of why we ask staff to come back and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do this update. It puts us in a position to think about how we want to move forward. If council wants to go a different direction, that's that. But I think what you articulated, that's what that's the process that I think we should take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'CEP is counsel, among other. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Sorry it took me a long time to unmute with the double button push thing. I think you could. Mr. Anthony, could you explain the difference by date of the variance currently between the county and the city of Orange?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. Did you say by date?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. There there is ends when and their repayment period is until when.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's ends on July 31st. Same as the city of Long Beach is does I think it's widely anticipated that the board of Supervisors will extend that? I don't know how far I think people are getting to August 31st, but that's not going to happen in the end of the month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm not sure on the specifics of the ordinances repayment period. To be honest, talking about the count.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are currently in alignment with the county with the July 31st date.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With respect to date, correct. Susan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And would you say that you mentioned specifically that there are different things that are covered? Do you can you outline any of the contingencies that are covered under there that are not covered under.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can give you some examples. And one of which is in the dependencies in the tidelands, as you'll recall, commercial tenancies in our tidelands are not covered by the ordinance, and they would be covered, in my opinion, by the county ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Assuming that it's not more than 500 employees and the county has similar exemptions along those lines, multinational companies, companies with more than X number of employees. But we have a tidelands exemption. We also have an airport exemption. I don't believe the county has either of those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those would be important. Okay. That helps me a lot. I would only ask just from a procedural standpoint, Mr. Richardson. Would it make more sense to, instead of receiving a file today, carrying this over to the July 14th meeting, then to Mr. Pierce's point, there wouldn't have to be any agenda by a staff member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would already be ready to go. So just just a thought from a procedural standpoint of that for you that you hear that analogy. And then at that time, if it's not ready, we could just take a single vote to carry it over to the 21st or 28th or whatever happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's just a thought. Other than that, I appreciate the presentation and the report, and I think those are very notable variances that could be important to distinguish how we handle them locally. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Sunday House.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilmember Richardson. I as you know, I am a renter here as well in Long Beach. And these times are very uncertain. So I can just imagine the difficulty it is right now for tens, maybe thousands of residents here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just wanted to say that I support the motion on the floor as it is right now and that we come back to. To to do this in a quick way. We also need to recognize that this is this is a crisis, and this crisis is certainly not over.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just last few weeks, we have seen our our reopening process needed to scale back because of this. This is not the numbers that are that we would like to be seen as far as COVID 19 goes. And it's just, you know, we don't know what the what the future near future holds for us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the better the faster we can get this approved and extended hopefully and aligned with the counties, the better, because we really are facing some very uncertain times right now. Clearly there's there's an incredible need for assistance in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we need to find those solutions to help without, you know, just simply being able to be there and create policy that helps them. And this is going to be a way of doing that. I'm so very grateful to the rental assistance programs that we have developed through the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I you know, I'm really happy about that, but I also am realistic about it in that it's only helping a very small percentage of those people, those residents that are in much need in our community right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, again, thank you for the work you've already done on this city staff and the work that you are going to be doing in the next couple weeks to bring something forward to us so that we can have a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And Councilman Soprano.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. During our last discussion of this topic, Assistant City Manager Linda Tatum was going to research funding from the CARES Act that would, I think, provide for a 50% program to pay for deferred rent. If if there's an update on that, I'd like to hear it now or at least bring that item back to our next'",
        "'speaker_2': 'discussion. Also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Supermom. This is Linda Tatum and we are working on a TFF that will provide an update on that. Those additional funding sources are not committed funding sources or better yet, we understand that we will be getting them, but we don't have a timeline for those additional sources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are going to, in the TFF per vote, provide an alternative to address the matching issue that we talked about during that last council meeting and that TFF will be coming back, I want to say, next week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That concludes council comment. Let's go to Republican.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our first speaker is Seagrams. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District three. It seems like there's a lot of talk going on, but very little action. Conversations are in the making are going to be happening. But this is stated as a temporary eviction moratorium and rent deferment. And we need a permanent eviction moratorium and rent deferment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When you're in these conversations, I hope you consider the demands of the people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cancel evictions, cancel rent, defund the police, and pay the people's rent. Get us out of this hole they all created, maybe not created. These problems were definitely created by greedy forefathers, but you perpetrate them. No. You. Yeah. And it is your job to create the solution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So September 30 sounds all good, but we need a permanent eviction moratorium and rent deferment. We need it past September 30. We need it until people are back to work, until we have a health care system that can support all people, until our house people and house people are housed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So consider that when you're in these conversations. Thank you so much. And I see you next week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Joshua Christian. Your time starts now. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council, I think I've begun. So, first of all, to say that we don't support the motion to table this debate and that we prefer it be resolved sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to start getting panicked phone calls from tenants this week asking what's going on August 1st? And I'd like to have an answer for those people quickly. But either way, let me let me talk about what we'd like to see in the final version of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are gaps in the eviction moratorium. They're preventing renters from enjoying substantial protections that are available at the county level. We've seen no abatement in no fault. 60 day notices issued to renters. And we've seen a substantial increase in, honestly, very startling incidences of landlord and tenant harassment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And both of those are banned at the county level, but neither was included in the Long Beach moratorium. Now it's our opinion that the simplest way to deal with that is simply to let the Long Beach moratorium expire, at which point the counties will kick in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, the foundation believes that that is clearly what will happen. So we have a disagreement with Mr. Anthony on that point, although we we entirely respect his opinion, of course. So if if the moratorium is not permitted to expire, then I'm going to urge the Council to consider introducing amendments to the Long Beach Ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was no way to predict several months ago exactly how serious this problem was going to be. But it is very important that tenants have these protections on the ground experiences showing that it's a real problem. Regardless, I request that a final ordinance extend the eviction moratorium to September 30th, which will align it with the governor's moratorium'",
        "'speaker_2': ', which he just signed, the executive order that was signed on June 30th. Two weeks ago, I testified here, and I mentioned UCLA's prediction that 120,000 renters are going to experience homelessness in the next year because of the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That number came out after eviction moratoriums were in place. So that wave is coming. So jurisdictions that choose to end their moratorium sooner are simply inviting that wave of evictions and homelessness sooner. So most of those newly homeless individuals are going to be from vulnerable communities, low income communities, and especially communities of color.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Census Bureau reported that 43% of black renters nationally were having either little or no confidence that they would make rent in July. The number was the same for Latino renters, 43% of renters, there were 20% who had the same concerns within the white community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that is that's within the national numbers. So it does not account for a community as diverse or as a renter impacted or as coded impacted as as Long Beach. Thank you. Next, we have Mike Martinson. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Gary, the mayor and council members on behalf of rental property owners, I urge you to look at other options before you extend the eviction moratorium later on this month. You know, we've been going round and round with this, and it would seem to me that there may be another alternative in that we get this into'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like a subcommittee, either housing or economic development, so we can start looking at creative ideas to try to resolve this. The one thing I do know is there's no evictions going on right now, and there's none this year in California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Judicial Council has already come out and said the civil courts are not taking unlawful detainer cases. So this talk about evictions occurring right now, it's not accurate. It's not real. So we need to come up with something else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm concerned on behalf of property owners that while we support Rex Richardson's idea of getting CARES act money to pay 50% of the deferred rent that are owed, that's what the assumption that there's no strings attached, i.e. income levels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As for the assumption that the tenants going to pay 50% of the deferred rent, whatever that amount is. Those are great assumptions, but that's what they are assumptions. So we need something a little bit more definitive. We need something to give some kind of mortgage relief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We darn well know that the city is not in a legal position to forgive rents. There's this talk going around town that the city council, the county, the state can forgive rent. They cannot forgive rent. To my knowledge, the only person to forgive rent the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So unless the federal government decides to chime in and forgive rent and forgive mortgage payments, it's all stuck on the landlords. So I just urge you to come up with some kind of creative solution in the interim, prior to the 29th Council meeting, set up a subcommittee meeting, set up an opportunity to discuss this through, see what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'else we can come up with. Landlords are willing to come to the table and come up with creative solutions while this is going on. Thank. You. Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. I just want to make one quick clarifying point. I just it's been mentioned and I talked about this with our city attorney today as well. There was a public comment and I've heard other comments about whether or not we would align with the county.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that our city attorney has an opinion on that. I think I think that we'll have an opportunity also to make some clarifications on that over the next few days. I know that the county might have one opinion and we might have another and certain groups might have a different opinion out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think there's also just gives us an opportunity to kind of clear some of that over the next few days. And the county is going to be having some discussions as well. And so I would encourage us to use the next week or so to get some of that clarity and just make sure we're on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the same page with L.A. County, because there is some difference of opinion about what about whether or not we should just have ours expire and whether or not that county would kick in. So I appreciate your opinion, Mr. Anthony, and we'll go ahead and go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are about one clarifying question, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We go to the queue or your queue? Okay, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here. Thank you. Yes, I appreciate the explanation. As I mentioned, we did a lot of conversations today about what would be covered in the county and not. And I just want to stay on the record so that we recognize one of the areas that I'm was told that would not be covered if we weren't with the county'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are the entities that we left out of the business part, which would be our port or tidelands and our airport. So I just want to recognize that while I wholeheartedly have talked for five days about going with the county, that when that information was brought up, it raising concerns for me, which is why I was supportive of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the motion to give direction to come back with the county. To be clear on timeline, I think there were public comments concerned around clarity when the council would take action and the city attorney wanting direction sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So should we assume that this item will be on next week's agenda? Because the next county meeting is on the 28th and I know that we're having a special on that, but if we don't get clear direction today, we need to do that before the 28th, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. This, right, Anthony? Yes, I would like that. Clear direction before the tape. I assume you should assume that it might come back in a week. I think the mayor and I won't speak for the mayor, but I think I think there is value in in doing some fact finding, talking to the county and allowing our office'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to do a little more research. If we can get a better opinion and a more clear opinion on whether or not the county ordinance would apply to Long Beach in the event that the city ordinance expires.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that. So that's. I just wanted to make sure before we went to a vote that we were clear that you needed to have some of that direction. I appreciate the time and recognize that today we we all felt like every half hour the facts were changing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate this and support this motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Mongo. Councilman Bango.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now we can. Yes. And we're going to go to a vote. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So one thing I would like to say is if we do find out that the counties would take over and the county is considering an extension, I think it's important for us to advocate for the similar exemptions of the tidelands, the airport and the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can't think of one right the second so that we don't lose a lot of those federal grants in the airport area at least. But that was one of the reasons that I was a part of it. And then I just have some hesitation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the biggest Tidelands clients has a conflict of interest with one councilmember. And so maybe if we could make sure that the other eight of us are the ones doing the advocacy with the county on that specific thing, I think that that would be the most appropriate way to handle that next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it, Councilwoman, and I think that the exemption question was brought up that you just brought up also. Absolutely. I think that's something we have to work out. You know, those are important to this body. So with that, we would go ahead and take a vote and do a roll call.'",
