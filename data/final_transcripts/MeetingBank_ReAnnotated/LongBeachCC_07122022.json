It seems like maybe a year ago or so finally in front of us to to to put out and I was wondering once'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Mayor, in terms of the resources being distributed, those are things that can happen immediately. So, for instance, with the Creative Economy grant for the Arts Council, though, those programs have been available for a series of months. They were actually extended just to maximize the amount of applicants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They closed on July 7th. They're in the process of making those decisions, and the money will be available to the Arts Council to issue those at such time that they are ready for the artist that they are giving grants to.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Great. And let me also ask the as far as all the broader economic recovery programs that we adopted. How many more are still on or on their way to council? Have we gone through most? I know many of them are going through an RFP process, but what percent of the money spent in the programs has actually gone'",
        "'speaker_0': 'out?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In terms of the the percentage of funds we can provide that to you very detailed case and we have begun to do that. And through our biannual report in terms of the number of programs in the economic recovery and healthy and safe communities buckets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All all except one have been internally approved and many are out and live. And there's a variety of others that are coming and anticipated during the summer, including our Universal Basic Income Program and some of those that have come to council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we can provide a full accounting of everything that you have seen for council action to date. And any that will ah, excuse me will be anticipated in the coming months for City Council contract authority approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. I personally and if the Council agrees, I'd like to get a public presentation from staff on all of the entire economic recovery package that was adopted. And just the status update of where of what money has gone out, what is still outstanding and where we are in the RFP process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we can wait a little bit. I know, I know a lot of these are kind of on the verge of happening right now, but it'd be nice maybe and you know, six weeks or a couple of months just to get a full update once you're feeling really good about where those programs are, because I'd like to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'come back and see the success of what we've done as a city. And I think the public a good time to remind the public as well of all the great things that the city is doing and how we're spending these funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. MODICA Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Happy to do that. And we're also in the process of building a very interactive dashboard that can show you all of that as well. We have a lot up already and then we're putting in a lot of the financials as well, so we'd be certainly willing to come and talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a lot of successes that have happened.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have the grants gone out like the restaurant grants and the fitness grants and all of those they have, right? Yep. Okay. And so it sounds like a vast majority of these of the grants have already gone out. And maybe there's some more that are still on the way to the council, but a major majority are out.'",
