        "'speaker_4': 'By the council approved in the lease for Fire Station nine. Does that help to fill the temporary station? Does that help take off some of the urgency of having to take action at the former site?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So we had originally when we started this about a year ago, we were looking for a the fastest temporary site available. So that looked to be station nine at the time. We got, however, deeper into it and discovered we needed to do a full year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That air is just about done and ready to be released. However, we do expect that our common period to take some additional time. We know there's a high level of interest in the community and so this was a quicker building for us to be able to get into.'",

And and I think it's important to mention that this is not negotiations for a permanent site is is the search in negotiations for a permanent site is still ongoing. And then one final question time. I would just say, with the air still moving forward, is it correct that ultimately it will be up to the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city council? What happens with the former fire station site?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, that's correct. It will be a city asset and we'll have a lot of information from the air on the status of it, including also some of the challenges that that building has in terms of, you know, the damage in the mold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it would be up to the city council, first in closed session and then an open session on how to what to do with that facility going forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, thank you for for clarifying that. Again, I want to thank the entire team, city team for all their work to do to help address our public safety response system. This temporary site, I believe, will help do that.'",

This was a difficult conversation to go in and have that discussion with the governor and the state and everyone else about making sure that their funding city responses and had we just had 20,000'",
        "'speaker_5': 'more people or 20, 30,000 more people, we would have gotten a direct allocation. But we really had to fight for this money. And the mayor led the charge. So thank you very much. So today I want to just give an overview of the money and kind of the general plan and kind of the next step.'",

We're going to talk about the recommended uses, which are the city's costs in response to the pandemic, including public health, how we're going to support community and residents and how we're going to do business in economic resiliency support and then get to the recommended action.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We went to the state and the state put in 450 million for all cities that did not receive a direct allocation. And Long Beach got the highest amount of any city in that allocation. And so when that budget was approved on June 30th, we got $40.3 million in CARES Act funding and immediately put together a plan to'",

        "'speaker_5': 'You know, spending $40 million in that short time frame. But we believe we just need to show the state and we'll be asking for exemptions to show that we have a plan and we are spending the money. The federal government requires that all cares act money be done by the end of December, which is a very tall'",
        "'speaker_5': 'order. And so what this money will help us with is first, we do have a very large budget shortfall in FY 20 that we've talked about. And a lot of that is due to spending money on our response as a local public health jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have a huge role in protecting public health, and so this money is going to help with those costs in Fy20 and Fy21 specifically related to the response. I want to be clear that cares ACT money cannot be used just to offset offset our revenue shortfalls.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is really about funding COVID tight costs. And so our goals were try to use the most strategic use of these funds to, one, minimize our shortfall caused by caused by the pandemic, to utilize the funds in a way to support these critically needed activities that aren't supported by other funding sources, and then work with all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of our available grants and minimize our net costs and help our community. And so that plan, we went to all the departments and asked them to meet these goals and then we identified a list of activities and functions and we had to match them all to the federal guidance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there are rules on what we can spend it under. We also looking at our city costs in response to the pandemic, how to support community and residents and how to support businesses. And we also are letting you know that today you're approving a general framework.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It may be, as we spend this money, that we run into bumps where we may have to move from one allocation to another in order to actually spend this amount of money. So we will be asking you for some flexibility and we'll keep you in the loop if things change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also took a lot of informal input. So we've been listening ever since March to what the council says with a lot of the needs are departments have been basically telling us through our emergency structure, what is that they're hearing out on the ground?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We hear a lot of input from community and business and residents during our responses. We've had lots of public comments at the various council meetings and city meetings, including also a reconciliation. And then also the council did ask us to look at all funding related to COVID and the COVID response through an equity lens.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as we put together these program criteria, we're going to be using that equity lens. So I want to cover the three big buckets. The first one is covering the city's costs. We have about $19.1 million that we've identified out of this bucket that could help offset existing costs or costs through the end of December.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We then have our section called Community Support, which is about $14.4 million. And this is going to be in areas such as homeless, sheltering, housing, condition improvements, basic needs, case managers to help out with the basic needs that we have and the basic needs program that the Council brought to us.'",

We know with so many things going online, there's a need for funding for that and of course supporting our arts community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Business support. We would do the balance $6.7 million towards business, and that would fall in a couple of different areas small business and nonprofit, PPE, distribution, where we can actually buy and use our purchasing power to buy and distribute PPE to businesses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We could create transition and recovery grants to businesses in the amount of $3.6 million. We want to fund our our bids directly and let them do their great work and have them support the businesses and be a force multiplier for us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And businesses are going to have needs like queuing systems, contactless payment systems. They need call centers. We want to fund an economic inclusion coordinator. We also want to be doing education to our businesses, support them through open streets, and also be looking at economic equity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also have other funding. So this is not the only funding dedicated to this effort. We have, for example, $13 million coming from the county to help fund our county response or I'm sorry, a public health response. We have another $13 million coming from the federal government to fund homelessness, as well as $1.8 million also coming from'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a different bucket of money to fund homelessness. And we have already $3.6 million coming from CDBG that the council has put towards the tenant assistance program. And we expect some additional moneys from that pot of money that can go towards tenant assistance as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so what you're approving tonight is really a bucket of money in the various categories. And then our job as your city staff will be to develop the program guidelines on how to distribute that very, very quickly to go through the federal procurement process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so what we're looking for tonight is approval of those of of the general plan. And then if you have any comments and thoughts on what you're hearing in the community as we tailor those approaches on how best to distribute this money through federal procurement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that's the recommended action. I do want to make one correction, a technical correction. The appropriation needs to read for an economic development instead of 5,250,000. It needs to read 5,500,000 and increase appropriations by that amount. And with that, I turn it back to the Council and ready to answer questions.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to thank her and her team and supervisor Barker as well, who was great. And just a couple other just council support, the state led committee that is made up of course, of Councilmember Richardson, Councilmember Orson and and councilman during.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to thank them and also Councilmember Mongo who I know has made the motion with also helpful on the county side. So it's been a team effort and we continue to go out and try to get more resources and we'll continue to do that.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I'd love to expand some of the categories a little bit just to make sure that we're not too narrow in our scope. I guess my question to the city staff is who will be doing the structuring of these programs to ensure that we set aside large quantities of money that it is distributed to several applicants, not just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a few. I mean, we have over 10,000 businesses in Long Beach that are Long Beach business license holders. But then we have another I'm sorry, 20,000 that are large business license holders, 10,000 which are brick and mortar in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then, according to the IRS, another 20,000 that don't even require Long Beach business licenses. When we talk about some of these funding areas, what is your thought process on? How to determine who qualifies for how much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So we have some general thoughts we want to hear from the council as well. We have not put together all the program criteria. I have John Keisler here as well as Kelly, who are going to be kind of be leading the two separate sections.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Linda is here as well, and she's going to be helping kind of overall. And so we did some quick math on on the buckets you're talking about. If we were to give every business a little bit of money, it'd probably be about $200 per business.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we want to make it large. So a lot of people can apply, but at some point we're going to run out of money. So we want to make it so that people it's a significant amount, a meaningful amount, but we are recognizing that we don't have unlimited funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have given some thought about trying to make this something that every business can apply for, but also making sure that we're getting it to some of the businesses that don't have any other resources, businesses that would traditionally not even know about these funds and and try to make sure that we don't have it all taken'",
        "'speaker_5': 'by the businesses that really know our systems very, very well. So there'll be some of that for for for some of those. But we're trying to intentionally also reach those who don't normally hear from the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And there's a couple of methodologies I've talked about with different business owners. Some feel that their gross receipts are indicative of their size. Other the others believe that the employees are indicative of their size. Business licenses in the city of Long Beach do have the number of employees on them, so that might be something that guides'",
        "'speaker_2': 'us. I'm really open to listening to more of what my colleagues have to say, and then hopefully I'm rounding it out here at the end. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'A few things, a few points. I want to I want to want to highlight. First, I know that we discussed creating a repayment plan on some of the back rent. And I know that that's a separate part of resources.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Linda Tatum. We'll handle that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Richardson, I think you are aware that when we took the rental assistance program subsequent to that, when there was a consideration for additional funding to make up the gap for those who were going to be a potential risk of eviction, we were looking for a way to supplement or to to make those the federal dollars go'",
        "'speaker_2': 'further by providing a match. So in short, the program, the rental assistance program is already funded per the one the 5.3 million. But we've anticipated getting a second a potential second round of CARES Act funding through the CDBG CEV.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's a potential funding source. However, that funding source is, if it comes through the city, it will come through the state. So we don't have an idea of the amount or the timing of that funding. But there's also a third round of potential CDBG VA funding, which likewise we don't have an idea of the timing of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that, but we anticipate to get somewhere between two and $4 million on that. So those are the potential additional funding pots we're looking at and that could be used for matching and or other housing assistance efforts or business assistance efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you. So I'd love to just stay updated on where that is. And it's an important program is a lot of concern about what happens when folks are at the end of the moratorium period and the repayment period when folks have a balloon payment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We want to do what we can to help avoid that. Okay. So just a few more pieces. I love that we've we've specifically called out a number of different products here from lack of equity, basic needs. These are really important resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's there was a letter today from Black Lives Matter, Long Beach that read some raise some good questions. And I and I think I want to go ahead and just highlight one of them. And it talks about our equity lines that we applied to this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and what it really calls for is for us to take a place in equity lines on each individual sort of space here to make sure that, as you know, as each one of these funds roll out, we're thinking about equity and we're thinking about how to make sure that they are targeted in a way that addresses'",
        "'speaker_3': 'barriers and gets to the communities that are that are impacted by COVID 19. And so I'll give an example. When we did our economic relief package, a part of that was we deployed, I think, $800,000 micro loans to small businesses in about three weeks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The money was gone and a lot of the hard to reach businesses. They never had a real opportunity to understand the program. And by the time they understood the program, these are communities that I mean, these are businesses that traditionally haven't engaged with the city very well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And do you know whatever barriers exist? And they were they missed the boat. I want to make sure that as we look at these different funds, that we do have a plan to address barriers and equity so that we get to some of the hardest some of the, you know, the businesses that are impacted the most about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'profits that are impacted the most, and the ones that do that do outreach into black communities, Latino communities. I want to make sure that that happens. So is is there a plan to come back with further explanation on how we're going to go ahead and address the equity issues and just how the programs will work on?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a plan to come back with a report on that or two from four?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So in any normal environment, we would have all that in this council letter. We'd put it all together. We'd spend a month or two understanding all the needs and putting it all out and bring and giving you all that detail, given the speed we needed to go right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To just are we headed in the right direction and get that direction tonight? And then we would put together the rest of those program criteria. We could do that in a memo and outline the general approach. We do want to hear tonight from council if this is the right direction that we're going in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We were thinking very similar. We're looking at potentially some of the maps that we have with the data that shows either COVID impacted communities or show impacted, you know, you know, all of our CVG areas and others that have income criteria on them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there are a number of different data sources that we are considering to make sure that this money does get utilized citywide, but also with a specific focus on communities that have higher needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that makes sense. I think when the memo comes back, the more you can point to like specific impacts of COVID and data to justify how we allocate the resources, I think that makes sense. A couple of issues I'm going to I'm going to raise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I had a good meeting with some of the local Long Beach restaurants who have some very specific needs. Obviously, we know that the restaurant industry, you know, we're projecting at potentially 50% of these restaurants not making it through this this this challenge, this COVID 19 pandemic and the economic circumstances surrounding it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that we should certainly, you know, economic development should sit down with them and make sure we fully understand before you roll out the economic development grants, like how to make sure these small mom and pop restaurants are getting what they need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've seen when, you know, sometimes grant programs come out and they don't necessarily meet what they actually need. So I want to make sure that that's informed and we do have a conversation with them and lead them and understand how we can target these resources to make a big impact on our local, local, small restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. So that's one piece that I want to I want to touch base on. Can we make that happen? Some.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'd certainly welcome input. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Next, I know that there's about 19, 19 million bucks going to backfill the Kobe. The city's deficit is released. The Kobe response and I think that's huge. I'm I'm proud say I'm glad to see that the state stepped in to help us with that I want to make sure I want to raise up the issue of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'fire. I know that right now with a health care emergency, some of the paramedics and they're doing things they haven't done before in there and there are impacts there. How is how is this 19 million or additional funds?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How are we? How are we making sure that that is addressing some of the needs in the fire department?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So when we did the COVID response, we basically told departments to spend what they need to spend to save lives. So that was fire department, health department and police department and Parks and Rec, anybody. And so we didn't give them a budget.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We didn't say, here's your COVID budget. We just said spend and track your costs. And so every department did that at the same time. We also asked them to save money in anything non-covid related. So what these funds can do is they basically will help to offset those costs to keep departments from going way over budget.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It becomes a general fund we don't allocated out to, you know, this is your piece and this is your piece. We essentially will use this citywide to fill and backfill the money that we've already spent in the current fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it will help us prevent having to do additional reductions in the current fiscal year. Next fiscal year, of course, we we have to make structural reductions well understood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what I'll say what I'll say here, the last thing I'll say is that I think so. There are a number of really important things. And we're going to obviously going to watch it, make sure that these things happen, understand the parameters that you have to get done before the end of the fiscal year, perhaps by the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'end of the year. I think as it relates to things like the basic needs, I think there are some low hanging fruit things. I just want to say it's consistent to the council item. We look forward to look at ways to just create a front door food access, and I see that there's case managers and things like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that here, so I'm really excited and eager to see that happen. I think the mayor announced a basic income pilot and you know, I don't know many details of that, but the concept is the same help address the basic needs of people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if there's a way to make sure the way we communicate it and align it makes sense, where there's a simple front door, you need assistance with food and shelter. You can call the city. We can help you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I want to make sure that we we know we don't miss that. I think as it relates to, you know, we did an item that was myself and Councilman Mongo and we did the item about the business transition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I see there's resources here about that to support the transition as it relates to queuing systems and contact contactless payment systems. I think we have to take that very, very seriously because, you know, our barbershops have had to close again and we're going to have to figure out how to how to manage how business is going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to survive in this open and closed situation until there are treatments or a light at the end of the tunnel on COVID 19. So I really want to see investments into tools like like, you know, queuing systems so you don't have to wait in line at your barbershop or at the nail salon where you those things are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there. So we're modernizing as this happens. And so I like a lot of these investments I'm going to make. I'm proud to see this in alignment with what we need. I also want to just chime in and just also thank the mayor for all of his work and city staff also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, just thank the region made it a top priority to address the 300 to 500000 cities as well, because this impacted Long Beach, a number of cities. So I do want to just say, you know, we're not alone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We work, we operate as a as a group within a region. And this is a big win, a big win across the region. Thanks a lot. And those are my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you. You know, first of all, I'd like to thank the manager team for their leadership during these times for ensuring that we receive our fair share of the dollars. You know, we know that we need the need is great in various areas and that funding only goes so far.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, for me, some of my priorities are, you know, making sure that these dollars are used in a way that displays equity, racial sensitivity, focusing on communities that need the most assistance. Under the Black Educational Program. I look forward to a sincere attempt to work with the stakeholders and organizations that are doing the work in our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'community. I know in the past organizations like Tranquility, Counseling and Hotlines and others have been kind of overlooked. And I also hope that we can bring back Black Lives Matter into the conversation, because I know Don is always looking for a way to steer the group into a positive and productive conversation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of course, I am looking forward to engaging with the Minister of Life and see the job as well. And for that, I just want to thank you guys very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to start the discussion by thanking the mayor for his advocacy and leadership on this. I know that we would not be here today, but for discussing this item, but for the mayor's leadership and advocacy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to thank you for that, Mr. Mayor. I do have a couple of specific points that I want to call out on this item. The first one is that I know that we have a lot of unofficial bids throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are business corridors that are working together collaboratively to advertise the corridor, to bring shoppers and diners to the corridor. But they're not officially a bid yet. Maybe they're working towards a bid, but they're not a bid yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to see some of that 5.5 million that's going to economic development go specifically to business corridors that might apply for some corridor improvements or corridor assistance. Corridor incentives, even though they're not part of an official bid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that something. Mr.. MODICA That could that could happen as a result of tonight's item?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. If the council would like to see that, we would likely suggest rather than coming out of the bids section since that is really for business improvement district that that be looked at as part of the 3.6 million.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of those businesses could group as a bundle and and kind of pool some of their resources at for a corridor and we can look at that if there's interest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that something that needs to come in the form of a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It certainly could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, Councilwoman Mango, would you accept that friendly? I would be very interested in the friendly. I do have additional questions for Mr. Modica. How many businesses in our city are in bids?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let John Geisler try to answer that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, absolutely, Councilmember. So so we have we don't have an exact total. Today it changes with their membership lists. But we we estimate it's approximately 5000 at any given time across nine different bids and ten total in the area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So that makes sense to me then from a proportion standpoint and I would accept differently. Great. Thank you for that. The other question that I had, Mr. Modica, is can this money be utilized for overtime services? I know that we have, at least from our public safety departments, a lot of overtime and probably many other departments'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as well. That has been utilized for COVID response and will continue to need to be utilized for COVID response.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, it can fund COVID directly related response, whether straight time or overtime, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. Because I think this is really an opportunity for us to. This is a this is a use it or lose it type of. Assistance that the city is getting. And so if we're able to really utilize it to the best of our ability and to the max that we can, then I think we can free'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up hopefully some of the budget for for other uses and other city needs. So I know that you are looking at that. Mr. MODICA but I just wanted to make sure that I clarified that. I know that Councilwoman Pierce and I have had a lot of discussions with some of our community members regarding a park that has'",
        "'speaker_2': 'become increasingly concerning between our two districts, Bixby Park and that one of the things that we've had a lot of concerns about in that area is a lot of gathering, very little social distancing, a lot of oversight at that park has been done traditionally in the past by police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really do think that there are lower cost ways to monitor that park and make sure that we're getting outreach and services and also complying with some of our COVID concerns regarding lowering the spread. So one of the things I wanted to ask is whether it's possible for us to try a pilot program at this park'",
        "'speaker_2': ', Bixby Park, specifically. There may be other parks that are in need of it where we have a park ranger at the park through the end of when this money can be spent to see whether or not we can help utilize that resource instead of a police officer, which would be a much lower cost to help us with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ensuring that we have social distancing with the various gatherings and the markets and things that take place there, as well as just oversight in general of the activities in that park. Is that something that could be utilized with these funds?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it would likely be an eligible expense, specifically if it's related to COVID. Of all of our hotspots, Bixby Park is certainly up there as one of our and one of our most challenging in terms of people congregating and not following the rules.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'd have to talk to the chief of police about operationally, you know, how he could make that work and whether the park ranger is is the best resource. We have had some of those initial conversations. So I don't think you need to add a line item today that could be part of the city response.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But if the council is supportive of that, we'd be happy to look at it and see what we can do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I just think it's a much lower cost and we've talked a lot about looking at things that our police officers are doing traditionally and thinking about other best uses or best resources for those services. And I think this is one of those categories where it's a lower cost alternative that provides some some oversight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It also is a hotspot in terms of a lot of our demonstrations and just general gatherings. Even though we're not supposed to have other types of gatherings, they're still happening. And I know we do get a lot of calls there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And having the police go out and give warnings is quite costly. So if you're if you're willing to do that, I know Councilwoman Pierce would also support that. So with that. Oh, and then the other thing, I just wanted to express my support for the arts of supporting the arts organizations and the arts endeavors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that they're suffering tremendously at this time because of the gathering prohibition on the live performance prohibition. So I think that anything we can do to assist them would be very, very valuable. And I look forward to seeing how these funds are spent to alleviate some of the pains that businesses, residents and communities have suffered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you. STAFF Really thank you. Mayor And all the mayor. STAFF For all the work you guys did to get us to this point, I think you've done a fantastic job. I work backwards from my notes since Councilmember Pryce just spoke.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I echo the comments about the park ranger at Bixby Park. I think it's much more cost effective or expect it to be more cost effective to have a park ranger there majority of the time versus having, you know, 2 to 8 police come and go throughout the day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that we've tried to get bike officers there in the past and that never really panned out. And I think in the moment that we're in, recognizing the benefit of a park ranger would be wonderful. So whatever we can do to to get a pilot program going with whatever funds you might be able to find'",
        "'speaker_2': ', I wholeheartedly support that in. Sooner rather than later, I would say. I know our police officers are also stretched right now while also on the on the comment around the small business support and using some funds for the bids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I totally support that. I do also recognize that we have a lot of businesses that feel like they're operating really on their own or not operating, but trying to get information and resources. And it's been a real challenge, particularly for those on Broadway and those on forth and between Alameda and Cherry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I definitely want to make sure that we're identifying some funds for that. So support that. And the other area that I want to pick out is the item. Let me pull it back up. Stacey had it up and then I closed my out like, oh, Stacey's gonna give me once again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's okay. I got it. So on on the list, there's an item for early childhood education. Care for those impacted it says to assist ECD providers. With this process. I think the way that this was originally written was in a way that would allow for all providers and youth serving organizations to provide services, low cost or funding'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to families. And I'm wondering I know I brought it up in our briefing today. Is there a line item in here outside of the youth programing for the 22 summer park sites that allows for low cost child care above five years old?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I'm going to have Kelly Colby talk a little bit about how you would take care of child care and our youth. I'd also like her to expand on our park ambassador program and youth ambassador program as we are going to be bringing on people who can walk through our public spaces and really help with some of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the challenges we're seeing in parks, which could, in addition to the idea of a park ranger, could could help with some compliance issues. So, Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, good evening, council members. So we have two line items. One is early childhood focus on early childhood education and the next is youth programing. And so we intend to sit down and look at those two parts of funding to determine how we best provide in-home child care to two youth who may be school age.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we will be working closely with workforce and others to determine how we best do that. As the early childhood effort was primarily for the 0 to 5 and then the youth programing was supporting some of the older youth.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But there is some opportunity there to to make sure that we're partnering across those systems to ensure that there's greater access for youth of all ages. Um. Do you have any other questions on that one? And then I'll follow up on the ambassador program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not questions. Your thoughts? I've talked to Senator Gonzales a little bit and a couple other folks. I mean. As a single mom of an eight year old. It is a really trying time. I mean, you guys hear me on all of our Zoom calls and I'm dealing with pickle jars and paint and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's just really hard. And if we're going to be in this situation for a long, a longer term length of time, I think that we have to really be creative. And I think what we've done with our Parks program this summer has been fantastic, even though we didn't queue up in time to get into one of them'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I would love to see a partnership and I don't know if this is within this funding, but it's a good time to bring it up. A partnership with our schools, our city staff, all the parks team, but also our colleges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that one of the challenges is is being able to find space during this time. And when we get back into the new school year, I think our park program or it's one adult for ten kids is great and maybe we could use our college spaces to identify classrooms since they're not going to be in session'",
        "'speaker_2': '. But I just really hope that we can be creative about how we do this. And I know that you've done a lot of work with your early childhood report that came out, I think, in 2018. And so I even as an opportunity to help support co-ops, that this might be a good time to kind of begin some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of that work. So I just we need a lot of help in that area and it's really going to impact working families as we move forward. So go ahead with the park ambassador piece.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Just to reflect on what you were saying, so we are in conversation with the school district and and we can also engage in conversations with the universities in terms of allocating additional spaces. So the 22 program, the 22 parks programs that are available this summer, sort of maxed out the locations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we already have been in conversation with the school district to identify the potential of utilizing some of their locations, at least for the rest of the summer. And now that they're not coming back or announced until at least October, that provides some additional opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we are looking at that already and a bit in conversation, um, in terms of the, in terms of the ambassador program. So we already have it's somewhere between 18 and 20 youth between the ages of 18 and 24 who have been trained through the, through workforce development to be parks ambassadors and supervised through parks to do'",
        "'speaker_7': 'education and outreach in parks, to support people following the orders and ensuring, you know, a safer place as possible. So those are already trained and I think they begin their work within. So I think within the next week or two to begin to utilize that so that that will be in place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They will also be in Bixby. We are looking at the height, at the parks with the highest utilization and so you will be seeing them out there fairly soon. The ambassador program is also being utilized to support contact tracing and other efforts through different training programs at workforce development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are all for youth ages 18 to 24.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And are those stipend or paid positions they.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are paid, yeah. So the funding that you see under the ambassador line, so workforce development pays for the first 200 hours of their time. And then the remainder of the funding that you see in the ambassador line helps support payment for those ambassadors until the end of the year until the funding runs out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's great. I would say that this is one of those areas. Whenever we talk about the potential of our community members getting together to have a black worker center or organization like that, and I know I've had many conversations the last two weeks with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would want to try to make sure that they are pulling they're getting their community members from the community that they're going to be working in. And we know that Bixby has a diverse community, and I would want to make sure that we try to line up those ambassadors as much as possible to reflect the communities that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're in. So that's my $0.02 there. Okay. Thank you on that. So small businesses, youth. I want to also echo the comments made by Councilmember Richardson and Councilmember De Andrews or Vice Mayor de Andrews around the Black Lives Matter concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also read the letter today and definitely agree that when we talk about equity toolkit, you know, when I agenda item at the beginning of COVID and the BLM work it, I know that we've been super small so we haven't had it come back yet, but it would be really helpful to have more than just a one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'line that says this is had an equity lens to it. I know the Health Department has a toolkit and that there's a potentially, you know, one or two page kind of checklist that we could go through that can be tied to some of these items as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to encourage us to be able to do that. I know it requires extra work. This is a moment of trust building as we change our practices. And I think it will go a really long way for us to have confidence that these allocations are being used in a way that the community is asking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for them to be. So with that, I thank you both very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You got some of your anger.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello? Can you hear me? My computer almost fell. First of all, I want to congratulate and thank the mayor for all the work that he's done in getting these funds. Long Beach has been timely, obviously, with the now the resurgence of the pandemic here in California and and the new stay at home order that we have from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the governor really makes this a crucial time in that period for us to get this released in a very timely. I want to also congratulate our Councilmember Rex Richardson, on his work with SAG and and working with them and and the other jurisdictions that make up the region where we're trying to work together to ensure that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get to make our communities work together and get this pandemic over with. I also want to address the fact that, you know, we are we aren't alone. We have a lot of people around the region that are that are very much concerned with what's taking place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm sure that we will be able to get out of this in a very positive way. I want to acknowledge that and their efforts in putting this together so quickly. I mean, I would say we got the money one day in the next week or so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is a there's a plan here, which is this we need some tweaking perhaps. And we're talking about that. Now, my councilmembers colleagues have addressed some of those that I certainly agree with many of them. I was especially pleased with Councilmember Pearce bringing up the Pacific Gateway and the work that they do and and how we could'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tap into those funds as well. And that core of people who would be able to assist us. Concerns that I have are more along. And it was mentioned about the the youth programing and what we have in mind with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're also talking about because of the new stay at home order, people are going to be home more often. And when schools are looking at staying closed for the rest of the year through January, that's going to put some stress and stress on families in a lot of different ways as well, not only with terms of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'food, but also childcare and and jobs. So I'm also hoping that we can support the Pacific Gateway program in one way or another to be able to provide some assistance in getting some jobs out. We had the contact tracing program up there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also have Census 2020 that we can still use a lot of help. The numbers are as formidable as I would like to see them in terms of what's going on out there with people registering and getting their names and all through the census.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's a lot of work that we need to do. Looking at this at these funds through an equity lens is certainly a very positive thing to look at, to have and let that work. We're looking at that as part of our discussion that we have here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm very pleased in general with the direction that we're taking with this. I know it's a short timeframe and turn around and just one question in terms of our discussion today, are we going to be getting a a an update or a report on where we're at with this in the day?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're also having the team and I think we're almost done with the framework discussions out there. I think that's going to be coming forward. And I guess we could tie all that in together to create a plan that will take us through the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. We will be giving additional information on as the programs get developed and we can give status updates on where we are with funding distribution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate that very much more. That's American. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is councilman's in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Thank you again to staff. Thank you very much for all the work that you've done. And and a big, huge thank you to you, Mayor, as well. I know that that there's been a lot of work put into this and I'm really happy to be supporting this item tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also would just like to really quickly voice my support for for these funds going towards scaling up our rental assistance program. And so many of my residents are struggling, and I think that providing security for renters is one of the best ways to be able to use these funds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would also like to voice my support for assisting assistance for our hospitality hospitality industry. As you know, a lot of our our residents are employed through the hospitality system and are one of the ones that have been affected greatly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that these funds would be greatly used in those forms. But I also think and which is probably one of the biggest concerns of mine, is to provide these funds for assistance to help people get jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm really happy that my colleagues have brought up Pacific Gateway because I know that they're coming up with really innovative ideas to be able to support our community in finding jobs. And so that's going to be really essential, especially in going forward when a lot of people continue to lose their jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you again for all your hard work on this item, and I'm wholeheartedly supporting this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to just, first of all, thank my colleagues for all of their comments. I don't disagree with much of what has been already articulated here. I want to thank you and your team for your excellent advocacy with Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Understanding that our city was really facing a a serious fiscal dilemma. This cares act windfall. Well will certainly make a difference to help us recoup our cost for emergency responses, but also will go a long way to help a lot of people in our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lot of needy families, a lot of youth. There's money here for seniors and elderly adults. There's an issue there's a line item here that that I'm especially interested in, and that is mental health and domestic violence. You know, last year, a half a million dollars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can somebody explain exactly what the thought is in terms of who will receive those, those those resources and the and whether or not those resources are accountable to the city or to to the state or to the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's a number. So the the the funding around the mental health and for and for domestic violence is a focus on increasing access education and access around mental health services within the city. As you know, the Department of Mental Health in the county is the primary funder and provider of mental health services within the city of Long'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Beach, and they subcontract out for those services that then support the city. Our goal with those funds is to increase the knowledge and access of those services to people who are experiencing mental health conditions related to COVID or that have been exacerbated by COVID.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So part of that is also helping connect people to different providers and other pieces. So that's one piece of the mental health service. And then the remaining part around the domestic violence would be to fund providers of domestic violence services with additional resources to support people who are experiencing domestic violence.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As there's been a lot of discussion about how people are staying home more that they may be in violent situations but are having a more difficult time being able to request service or to engage. And what are the ways that we can better support access to domestic violence services?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's the funding at this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we know, for example, the women's shelter of Long Beach where they fall into that category. Would they fall into the homeless shelter?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They would it would fall under I think they could fall under either of them or both, just depending on what it is that they are seeking. So that would be something that we would have to look at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Well, we know that they're doing good work and our and our community would love to see them considered. I guess the question also I have for for for you, Kelly or Tom, is how will these these funds actually.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Be. Allocate it, or how will we decide who or what organizations and what agencies receive these funds? It will be a hodgepodge of different for each line item. Or is there a process for for this overall? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'll start and I'll have Kelly join in. So we do have to follow some federal procurement guidelines. We obviously need to go very, very quickly. And so we're looking for ways that we can make this a very easy process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, in some for businesses will be able to set up kiosks and take applications and do it that way. If we're looking to deliver actual services, we're going to have to create kind of a scope of work and then have people bid on that and submit their application.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, we we are looking and working with our procurement partners in finance to try to make this as easy as possible so that it's not a prolonged process and get their money out the door quickly. So, Kelly, anything you want to add?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think also what we wanted to ensure that the council members had an opportunity to review and engage in this conversation prior to final design of any programs just to ensure that we that we were capturing any additional feedback.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So from this space, we will be going back starting tomorrow to do the design. And so what are the criteria and then how are we funding through those programs? So that will be forthcoming and you'll be hearing more about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're also seeking to do a coordinated effort across all the programs, just in terms of the ability to get the money out the door and in order, you know, the most the most efficient way to organizations that really need it across the city and who have been impacted by COVID.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one thing we know that you're going to get the requests and say, how do I access these dollars? So if you could just help us by collecting those and we want to build an email list. And when we're ready to put this money out, we want to make sure everyone who who has been asking about it'",
        "'speaker_5': 'gets included so that they have a chance to to apply it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly. Thank you for that clarification. And I would just say that I think what we have before us is pretty, pretty broad. It covers a lot and will help a lot of people. I am very, very concerned about childcare for for working families, many of the essential workers who are not necessarily health care providers with some or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all, but there are a lot of folks out there who, who, who without school been in session coming up in September or having some sort of modified school year for children. It's going to be even that's going to be a major hurdle for for a lot of working families.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think we've said, you know, looking at what we approved this evening, we should make sure that we have some flexibility and allow some flexibility to address those type of challenges as we as we and assess our our needs moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think that this is a this is a guideline. I think that we will be approving tonight. But I'd like to see some flexibility and maybe I should ask those. And will our vote this evening provide that flexibility for this for staff or for the council to want to come back in and and adjust if necessary'",
        "'speaker_5': '? So that is the recommendation that we are asking for. And the way we would do that is if we saw a category that really needed to be changed, we would ask the ability for us to come up with a different plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We would put that out in writing to you and kind of move forward. Unless there was objection and the council wanted to formally come bring it back and vote. So that would be our plan is to keep everyone informed of changing circumstances and have that flexibility to make sure the money gets spent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I think we should of and I'm. Really interested. I know other council members are queued up and this is a conversation, but that had a line item on that. That area where we want to have early childhood support, we should look at and look at that very closely and possibly consider or consider even increasing that'",
        "'speaker_4': '. I'm curious to know how we came up with these numbers. I know this is this is all you know. Quick response and everything about local government for the last few months has been quick response. I can can you give us some insight on on what was what was the methodology even to come up with the the line'",
        "'speaker_4': 'items and assess need for the budget here in front of us?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So Kelly actually led a group at our emergency operation center, put a group together of kind of subject matter experts in all the departments and talked about what is it that we're going to need over the next six months in terms of supporting people through this COVID response?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that covered business and residents and and health outcomes and a number of different areas. And then we had the kind of like a budget process. The departments put together their ideas and thoughts and kind of a wish list.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, and then our team gets together and tries to, to make it all fit. So in some of these it was, this is how much we can afford, and then we'll craft programs that we can create to it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So again, we also want to make sure that we're meeting your needs. We listened a lot to what the council has to say as you talk about digital divide, as you talk about mental health and substance abuse and and those types of things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's a little bit of art and a little bit of science.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, we know we have a very talented team and our health department, our senior management team staff, and these conversations have to be had with the city council. Those are my comments for now. I do like the direction this is going in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Overall, I have concerns. I would like to see potentially more resources and I see potentially a need for more resources and mental health and domestic violence and potentially early childhood support. Beyond that, I do think most of the needs, as I've been listening to my community and and listening to the public, I think their every just about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'everything is considered here. And I really am supportive of. The business improvement districts, the loan and grant programs to those those areas. As you know, we have two business districts in the eighth District. We also have unofficial business districts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I do support the thought behind allocating resources and getting those those areas that aren't necessarily official business districts resources as well. And so those are my comments. Thank you all and appreciate all the great work that has gone into getting us here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is this is a unusual situation where we are now tasked with spending our resources in the middle of the year and prior to our our budget process, which will probably give us less encouraging numbers to work with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know we're going to be faced with a challenge in the upcoming fiscal year. So let's. Let's let's help our community and allocate resources while we can. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You let me go to Councilmember Supernanny.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'd also like to thank the and everyone. I guess what strikes me the most is what our starting point was. It was a lot less than the 40 or 53 million. So to see where we are today is absolutely staggering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So kudos to those who put in work to get the funding. Also like to thank Councilwoman Pryce and also Mongo for accepting the friendly. Um, it's. We have two bids in the fourth district, but we also have huge areas that are not part of a bid, specifically the greater traffic circle area and also the Los Altos Shopping'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Center. So I think we really have to help those folks, too. On the point of the restaurants where it was stated that. Half of the restaurants you go under if they don't receive assistance and the term mom and pop restaurants was used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just like to add to that that the major brands, while the franchise owner may be a major corporation, many times the franchisee is a small business person, so they deserve some attention to. And when I think of the restaurants, I just think of, well, I'll just say the service sector in general is a huge job creating'",
        "'speaker_3': 'machine in our city and in many cities. And I think we have to look at it in terms of that, that the businesses may be located in a particular area of the city or some council district, but those working in those jobs are all over our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And really that's what we're doing and we're helping those folks. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I may go back to Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just three more things. So. So, first, I love the comments on early childhood education, childcare. And that's important. Just having two children that are actively enrolled in it, I can tell you they're having a tough time with learning how to make data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so let's not lose track of there are a lot of like we don't have universal pre-K, so we have public and private childcare centers who are struggling to figure out all of our rules. What does it look like?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How do they keep all those things? And so a part of this is making sure that we we figure out how to talk with them and communicate with them and make sure that when you if you go back, you know, go back in the fall or of childcare happens, a lot of these groups, these childcare facilities not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'connected to lobbies, unified, they're more connected to our local health department than they are. I was make sure that we we place that lens on that. That's for the sake of the kids. Second thing I would say is I there's been a lot of good discussion on the human factors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to just remind remind the council that last week we talked about leveraging this as well as some of the coronavirus relief funds to target in a way that helps address it helps interrupt the violence that's happening in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If it hadn't come up on this call. So I just want to make sure that that that staff hears that, that we need to make sure that we are, you know, consistent with the commitment we made last week to violence interruption.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that that's going to happen, but I think it's important to the public that they hear us say that today. So target the work that we have to do around some of the coronavirus relief and youth ambassadors to violence interruption work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also think it's a good idea to talk about just some flexibility on how those dollars are are spent. I think I think you're right. The bids are a point in time on who's organized. But a lot of activity is, you know, groups who have trying to get organized or maybe they'll be a business district next year'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if it were not for the COVID pandemic. But these ears are just as important. So I definitely want make sure we have some flexibility. I also want to say that all bids are not created equal. You know, our our business district in uptown has a quorum and on on a year in their meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just just make sure we're flexible that, you know, we want the we want the funding to go to those areas. But that means that we need to kind of work with them to get it done because they may not have the capacity to be flexible in that way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Make sure that we just understand that there are more than one way, more than one way to support the business improvement district. So in those so those are my final comments. In general, I think we should make sure that we're going to have to go back and get additional funding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's just the reality. This this issue is not over. We're going to have to go advocate for the Federal Heroes Act. We're going to have to advocate for state and federal stimulus. Those conversations begin now. We're going to have a big state, large bed, large, our mayor, Greg and all the others to get right back to the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'table and talk about what's next. Thanks a lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me go ahead now. I think that concludes the council comment. Let me go ahead and go to public comment and then Councilman Mongo, I think, wants to close this out. Is there a public comment on this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, we have two speakers. The first speakers, Kelly Lucero.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. Yes, thank you, Mr. President of the London Symphony and Mayor Garcia, city council members and city staff. As a 35 year resident of this great city, I just wanted to thank you for your extraordinary leadership during this time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you can imagine, the city's arts organizations are devastated by the pandemic. Our artists and musicians have been out of work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'March, and our staff are enduring severe pay cuts and massive layoffs, knowing we will be the industry to most likely open last. We are in desperate need of your help by including the arts organizations. In the proposed test funding, you are once again demonstrating your ongoing commitment to keeping arts alive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just wanted to thank you all so much for your vision and your investment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for your vote to support this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Sara. Next Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next speakers. Mike Merchants in your time starts now. Good evening, Mayor and Council Members on behalf of over 1000 full service restaurants and thousands of employees in our city, I want to thank you for at least having the conversation about the impact of the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'COVID and everything else goes along with keeping a restaurant opening or opening a restaurant. And I also want to specifically thank Councilmember Richardson and Councilmember Supernova for their very kind comments. I wanted to ask the council, as the city manager mentioned, that the funding has to be spent at the CARES Act funding before the end of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'calendar year to look at and possibly try to identify other funds within the CARES Act or some of the other programs to help out these restaurants. The restaurants are a true family of owners who have built their restaurants and devoted their lives to the thousands of employees who depend upon those owners keeping the restaurants open.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They depend upon that because that's how they pay their rent and everything else. This is huge. It needs some very hard thinking by all of you to figure out how to offset the costs, the payroll costs, the loss of food and beverages gone bad.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Restaurants need your help. I appreciate your thoughts that you may have as we move forward together. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I appreciate all the council comments and many of my questions have been answered, but I still do have a few remaining questions on the homeless sheltering in $2 million. It states that they're not currently FEMA eligible on some of our shelters or any of our shelters eligible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And why were these not FEMA eligible?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Theresa Chandler will answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. So that the FEMA eligible were for the non congregate shelters. So our shelter that we put up at Silverado was considered congregate because everybody was in the same space. So the eligible is under the non congregate shelters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's the difference. That qualified. Did we know that we set up the shelter? We were yes, we were aware of that, but we thought that some of the funding was going to cover the congregate sheltering. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we also use some of the state money to fund some of the congregate sheltering as well. We had state of homeless money for that too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What's the total amount spent on the congregate shelters? I'm sorry. I can get back to you on the number. I think it was about 2.5 million. But I can get back to you on that the full amount. I just felt like the number wasn't as proportionate to our winter shelter numbers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I thought I would kind of dove in and find out why is it so much more expensive? Or is this projecting through several more months ahead?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the sites at Silverado and others are temporary. And they also were something that were done, particularly utilizing staff, volunteers, others who were able to pull together to ensure that this is in place. The Winter Shelter contract is a contract with LAHSA.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The funding is based. The funding is. The funding comes from them and they are the ones to negotiate that. So I believe that they paid $30 per bed night, including all meals and and others, I think is the appropriate is how much they pay per person per bed night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when we started the project Roomkey and started to have significant reductions in sheltering needs, did we close these up as soon as possible or are we still operating at lower capacities because the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The congregate shelters? Mm hmm. Yeah. So we those were not operating at full capacity. So we had we had opened two we had opened the one at Silverado first. We then opened the one at King Park because those were not full.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We reduced. And the King Park, they were then aligned partly into Project ROOMKEY, as well as into the Silverado shelter and the Winter Shelter. Given the current status of that and they were Project Roomkey continues. Also, additional shelters across the city have opened and so there has.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When COVID hit, most of those shelters start taking new, new people. And so we needed those additional shelters to support. Those are now starting to open with new abilities to, you know, they've taken on all the practices required to be able to open safe shelters under these COVID times, which has allowed us to close the Silverado shelter'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and to operate the winter shelter through the contract with Lahsa Project Roomkey. And then also the the other local shelters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm understanding from community feedback that there are two encampments that are not being addressed by other neighboring agencies. Are we able to, under any of this funding, do outreach into those encampments and ensure that people are being housed and or encouraged to safe distance?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember. We have continued to do outreach throughout the city, reaching out to, you know, coach people on safe distances as well as, you know, providing kits and things to help us with sanitization and others. We continue to offer services and to work with people to to access shelter when the winter when the year round shelter comes online'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, toward the end of August and September, then we'll be able to have, you know, additional 125 bed capacity to support across the different system. But we do continue to outreach and work with our partners to engage in those encampments, to assist them into housing when they're interested.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Mental health and domestic violence. It says it includes an education campaign. What percentage of the 500,000 is an education campaign? What do we believe that would look like?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And believe that it's I think it's approximately $100,000 run education campaign, which be working a lot around social media, around different billboards and busses and everything we can to be able to to be able to educate folks as well as working within community community partners who are connected across the different community members, different neighborhoods and others, to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be able to really reach out and get the word out through through sort of nontraditional partners to ensure that everyone is aware of and has access to the services that they need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. The cooling systems and contactless payment systems, I'm really supportive of this. But I'm curious, do we have any idea in the selecting of how much money we're putting towards this, what a system like that costs?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council member. So so we have some ideas about different types of subscription based software that is either available online via the cloud and also many POS systems now will actually provide the hardware in exchange for service fees and other things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there's a there's a number of different business models out there. We're going to be working with probably some some digital navigators out there who are implementing these systems to find out what the options are. And then, of course, working with the different sections or sectors of, of, of business types that use different types of platforms for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'their specific needs. So as an example, also in that council recommendation that was passed as part of the responsible reopening package, there were questions about queuing systems, reservation and registration systems, point of sale. So there's a there's a large range of different types of solutions that we'll be looking at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we believe that a lot of the recommendations about solutions will actually come out of the businesses themselves that apply for these grants. So in our estimation, there's going to be a range of about 500 to $1000 is going to be the sweet spot for many of these systems.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm sure we're going to find some that are that cost less and some that cost more depending on what what support they need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, a lot of them come with ongoing costs that the business would be burdening. And so I guess my recommendation overall would be that when the businesses apply for any of the grant funds from. Line 16 through the end, I would like to see a single application, a single application that has a very short section on the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'top that kind of gives us perspective on their business and then really goes into check marks and the amount by each grant category because as a small business you might have PPE distribution, you might have the queuing system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, all of these. Individually. They can't be looked at one at a time. They really need to be looked at globally and then really appraised as a whole on prioritization of the businesses based on both an equity lens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as I met with the restaurant owners yesterday and I've met with them several times over the last six weeks, and we kind of talk about, as Councilmember Richardson said and they said this to me yesterday, it's expected that 50% of these businesses aren't going to survive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we want to make sure that we are making the investments in the organizations that will survive and then working to ensure that the businesses that are most closely helping us recover by jobs. So an example is that the city, I think I heard estimates between 21 and 22,000 jobs in foodservice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If 50% of our food service business at, well, restaurants went under, which would be less than 50% of the food service businesses, because there's categories within that. We were talking about significant jobs. And so you want to make sure that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also are taking into consideration if you have a business that employs 75 people and a business that employs five people, that there's some proportionality in our allocations in there bringing back our workforce because what we really need to recover is jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then in any case, a lot of this can be reimbursement. A lot of these businesses have already outlaid the cash. And so I would hope that when the application comes out, they say, okay, I'm asking for $1,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So far I've spent $4,000 and here's why and what that looks like. And so that they those that have already made those investments are the ones really able to access that funding first, because they're also the ones that have been reopening and getting closed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to address the discussion around childcare. I've done a lot of work with workforce Workforce. The Work Source Center on Workforce Development and one of the areas that's been hit hard was our childcare workers. So childcare workers that used to work at congregate childcare facilities are now available to the community to be hired, keep good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'standards in their personal life, and then be available to go into your home and others. I've really done a lot of promotion and a lot of the mommy groups that I'm in, and the price point is just not acceptable for the current financial status of the families.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so what I would like to see is on the item that Councilmember Austin and Pearce were discussing. Which is early childhood support. I'd like to expand that to say early childhood support and child care. Work force. Program subsidy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that it's closer to the price point that is really market rate. So I don't know what it is right now. I can make up some number. If the market rate is currently a and work source is charging B, then maybe we find out what that variances and add another 10% and then offer that program through that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rate for individuals who are trying to go back to work or have been reentering the workforce or whatever we do. But I would really like to see that. Councilmember Richardson, do you think that that's something that you'd agree to?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Sounds good to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And then within the categories and business support, I'd like to see some flexibility. I'd like to add some verbiage, quite honestly, to any of the categories, but I'll add it in the 3.6 million to also say that some of our businesses have very, very different needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They had a workforce, a work environment that really had social distancing and other things and or they've really been able to meet some of the other categories. They might already have a queuing system. They might already have some of these other things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And where they're really struggling is that they will never be able to get past that rent payment. So I'd also like to see, similar to my agenda item last week, I recognize that you probably had already finished this list on a rent, a back rent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So march through, let's say June 30th. Rent. It payback matching. So if your rent was deferred for three months, months, and you are able to start a payback program that we would provide matching funds, and I'm not necessarily saying 1 to 1, I'm going to leave that to the staff to come up with what makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also recognize that some of these places have rent that's two 3000 a month and others have rent that's 25,000 a month. And we're not going to be able to get very far if we're giving money in those bigger categories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, those categories might be easier for businesses to fill out, and with all the day to day things that they're really encountering, to be able to just say, I'm behind on my rent $75,000, but I'm not going under.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to take this on and I'm asking for three, five, nine. Whatever we decide as a city, the city staff decide is the appropriate amount of a maximum amount for recovery and resilience based on their employee numbers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then I would like to see that we would come up with some kind of aid in that category and as we draw down additional care funds, as assistant city manager Tatum stated, I'd like to see this expanded because I feel like the number one thing I'm hearing from businesses is they'll never be able to get over that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'balloon payment. And so I want to find a way that we can get there so that we can maintain those jobs in our city. Because without them small businesses, which the national number, they say 80% of jobs are really housed in small businesses, we won't be able to recover without those jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that would be my comments. Councilmember Richardson, are you open to that amendment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I don't think it is requires an amendment. What we just gave direction for on those resources is for staff to have the flexibility to design it the way we designed. I think I feel like if some of these small business loans or grants want to use it for rent, I problem with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But what I don't see.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In my staff briefing I'm sorry, and myself and my staff briefing rent was not specifically mentioned on here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So yeah, no, I think it could be included as a broader set of things. I just love to see what's that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And councilmember, if I can jump in here. So I think Councilmember Mongeau is just trying to make sure if somebody has, you know, if rent is their biggest need and there's a there's they apply for one of these grants that they can use it for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're supportive of making it just a larger bucket of COVID related costs and we don't need to get into specifics. Will pay for this, but not for that. We'll try to be as flexible. And if they've lost income and they're behind on their rent and they want to use it for that, where another business might want'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to use it for barricades to set up in their parking lot. We want to be very flexible. If that's not the intent. If you want to create a different rent program, then we would need to to move things around from the buckets of money that we have here or address that when the CDBG money comes in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me just say, this is the mayor. I'm going to go back to the council. But guys, it's one I'm sure we're moving along. We have a very long agenda we've been in for a very long time. So let me go back to Councilman Mongo and then those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are my only comments, sir. That was the end. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just wanted to. There was one item that I left off of my list. I support everything that's been said, and I think it would be great to have a lot of money that businesses could decide to use for back rent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I support that as well. On the rental assistance, we we didn't bring it up because staff had told us that this was it would come back with a C to BG funds. I just wanted to lift it up and the issues that some of the tenants have had with the application process, I know that there's a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'letter that staff has around some of these issues, and I hope that as these items come back to us, that those issues can be addressed. And I think some of them were like being able to make changes to the application, making sure that people could get the application in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know we have some seniors that have had some challenges, so I will save us the time and not go through the whole list. But I hope that we can address those when these items come back.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And with that, Miss Tatum, I'll turn over to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. We appreciate that, that background. And I'd like to introduce our director of development services, Oscar Orsi, who will present the the team that will be making the presentation for tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. Members of the city council. I'm very delighted to bring this matter in front of you. As the mayor just indicated, we've been working many years to put this program together. This program began as a recommendation for the mayor's 29 recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with that, I want to introduce the team Patrick here and Christopher Koontz. Both will be presenting tonight's item. Thank you. Patrick.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Oscar. An honorable mayor and city council. Tonight, we're here to present a proposed framework for an inclusionary housing policy and to seek approval to prepare an inclusionary housing ordinance. I wanted to point out that we have Cathy Head, managing principal of Kaiser Marston and Associates, here with us tonight to help answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The zoning code includes an existing voluntary inclusionary housing program to create affordable housing. The program offers a density bonus to encourage participation and an option to pay in and Luthi in place of providing the affordable housing units. The program has never been used.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The City Council has directed staff to develop an inclusionary housing policy, and staff recommends replacing the existing voluntary program with a new inclusionary housing program. We engage Lazard Development Consultants and Kiser Marston Associates to assist with this effort.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The preparation of an economic analysis is a key component of the development of an inclusionary housing policy. Kaiser Marston prepared an economic analysis to analyze the feasibility of an inclusionary housing policy. It assesses the impacts on development created by the imposition of inclusionary housing requirements, determines the feasibility of a program in the Long Beach housing market and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'estimates supportable in Lucy amounts. The analysis also provides information on other programs in California, reviews relevant state law and discusses state density bonus incentives to present recommendations for a policy. Over 170 jurisdictions in California have an inclusionary housing program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Recent state law has enabled cities to adopt inclusionary housing policies, provided that they do not act as a constraint to development or deprive a property owner of a fair and reasonable return. And inclusionary housing program must balance the interests of property owners and developers against the public benefit created by the production of affordable housing units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We included here a 2020 income chart for your information, so that you will know what what the incomes equate to when we're talking about incomes. The economic analysis determined the maximum supportable inclusionary percentages for single and mixed income alternatives shown here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The inclusionary percentages presented percentages for rental. Single income alternatives are 11% for 100%. Very low income. 12% for 100% low income. And 19% for 100% moderate income only the moderate income alternative was tested for ownership housing. The maximum supportable in lieu fee is calculated in the economic analysis are shown here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They range from 223000 to 383000 per unit for rental units and 270,400 for ownership units. State housing element law requires adequately zoned land to accommodate a share of the region's projected housing needs, or what we call arena for the planning period.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The arena is divided by income category. The top chart shows the city's current allocation and production progress through 2019. As you can see, very few moderate income units have been produced. The 28 that were produced were negotiated through the sale of successor agency owned sites, and the bottom chart shows the expected range of over 26,000 units for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the next planning period. And we're working on the housing element for that planning period now. The the housing elements renamed requirements will increase the city's production requirements substantially, as you saw from that last chart of 26 over 26,000 units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In terms of meeting current Rina goals, staff expects the city to do well in the above moderate category and fairly well in the very low income category. But we will fall short in the moderate income and low income categories.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And inclusionary policy is critical to addressing the next housing element requirements. There are currently five subsidized, affordable housing projects under construction or recently completed. Those are shown here. These projects all contain a combination of federal, state and county funding, and these funding programs heavily target the inclusion of extremely low and very low income units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a result, 295 or more than two thirds of these 439 affordable units are set aside for very low and extremely low income households. There is no funding for moderate income units. And I'm going to hand it over to Christopher at this point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Patrick. So with that background, I'm going to go over the detailed proposal that was first developed by staff. And then our planning commission spent a good amount of time at multiple meetings to refine that policy based on public input.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's based on submarket designations. So that's really where is development occurring and not occurring today. A differentiation between mandatory and triggered requirements, legally required alternative means of compliance and then the general program requirements. This map is a map of two different sub areas that have two different requirements.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So inclusionary does or will exist and be required in both locations, but there's different triggers. So area one, which is broken down as one and one B could be called downtown and midtown, but it could also be described as those areas where development is occurring today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The vast majority, over 90% of all the units built in the city over the last ten years are in this area. One area two has a different trigger related to legislative action, such as zone changes and general plan amendments that would trigger the inclusionary requirements.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I just talked about the downtown plan area and Midtown Plan area. Those requirements would be triggered on all projects over ten units. Some have asked why the other requirement does not apply to less than ten units. There's two critical reasons those very small projects, one through nine units, have much higher fixed cost and in a nutshell'",
        "'speaker_9': 'are less profitable, particularly on a per unit basis. If we were to include those types of projects in our analysis, they are high cost of those projects would drag down the total amount of inclusionary that we're able to impose.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Also, those projects serve an important purpose but are extremely rare in terms of the type of projects produce. All of these requirements will take effect on January 1st of next calendar year. I think there's one inconsistency in your written packet that references October, but we would synchronize all the requirements to trigger on January 1st.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Area. Two is the remainder of the city. It will be triggered on applications for zone changes, plan amendments and exceptions. It would also take effect on January 1st. We are working on a separate but parallel track on an enhanced density bonus program, which is going to be delighted for the first time at our Planning Commission on Thursday'",
        "'speaker_9': '. All of those efforts will come together on January 1st. So this gives you an idea of where staff started and we presented Ops and A, B and C to the Planning Commission and they made changes to that which are on the next slide.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What was adopted by the Planning Commission, based on their analysis and the public testimony, was a inclusionary requirement that 12% of units in any project would be affordable, and within that subset of affordable units, 25% would be very low, 25% will be low and 50% would be moderate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Planning Commission made these changes in specific response to testimony and their own analysis for the need to address all three income levels in the adopted policy. Which brings us to today. What in your report is referenced as option B?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Which staffs the recommended option is what was approved by the Planning Commission. We have also presented other options. If the Council wish to go in a different policy direction, that may emphasize different income levels differently. There is a different amount of subsidy required for a very low income unit versus a low income unit versus a moderate income'",
        "'speaker_9': 'unit. And if you think the sum of all of that subsidy, we can't exceed that sweet spot or that bubble because that would make development not feasible at all. And any percentage of zero is zero, as we all remember, from high school math.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what we're trying to do is keep the development and investment in the city going, but to have a public benefit of creating those affordable units. So again, this is just a staff recommendation which says that 12% of rental housing units would be affordable and that would be split among the three income levels at a 25, 2550'",
        "'speaker_9': 'split and ownership because of the nuance of ownership projects. That would be a 10% requirement and that would be at the moderate level. Faison is an important component of any inclusionary policy. So while Inclusionary has been a discussion in the city since at least 2012, we're going from having no inclusionary policy at all to a fairly robust'",
        "'speaker_9': 'one which has presented to you today. That requires the market time to adjust. That adjustment happens both in the product that they are delivering, their expectation of cost and profits, as well as changes that will occur in land values as land is bought and sold.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For that reason, there's a five year phase in recommended for you, and we would highly recommend that you stick to the phased in schedule. There are a number of alternative means of compliance. I'm not going to spend time on this other than to tell you that these are legally required but not anticipated to be used.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And our focus is on having the housing built and included within the projects that come forward, and that is the goal. We heard loud and clear from our partners in the development community as well as from the public, and an earful from our planning commission that they inclusionary policy is the stick, but we also need carrots.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we are looking at a number of incentives that would go along with this policy. So that includes existing fee exemptions for for low income units in terms of their impact fees. It includes providing priority plan services without any expediting cost.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And providing projects that have robust affordability levels would be given priority entitlement processing. And on a separate but parallel path, we are updating the city's density bonus ordinance and that would all come together on January 1st, as we discussed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is a situation that has not occurred, but we have thought out all of the possibilities. So in terms of condominium conversions there, that is dealt with in this ordinance and we can go into detail later if there's a council question on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Density bonus law does apply to all projects in California, so that would include projects that are built pursuant to this ordinance. So in addition to requiring the affordable units, the developer, if they include enough affordable units, would be eligible for incentives under state law.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as I mentioned previously, the city recognizes the need to update our local ordinance, and that effort is ongoing. In case you're wondering, the logistics of how this works, a project will come along. Let's say it's a 100 unit project.'",
        "'speaker_9': '12 of those units would be required to be affordable at various different rates. They would record a covenant against the title. Their covenant would run for 55 years for rental units, for ownership units. It would run for 45 years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is consistent with best practices up and down the state. We do monitor each and every covenant in the city. They pay a small fee to cover that monitoring and any fees that we're paid, either because the project was small enough to pay fees or because of a fractional unit would be accumulated in the inclusionary housing fund'",
        "'speaker_9': ', which would be used in concert with other funds to fund 100% affordable projects through a competitive process. As currently drafted, this program will be reviewed in year three and presented to the Planning Commission, and then the entire program will be reevaluated at year five and presented to this Council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will be adopting a number of administrative procedures that will exist within Emanuel because they're not required to exist in the municipal code itself. This gives you just the recent history. This project has included community engagement and that took part between December of 2018 and our Planning Commission hearing in February of 2020.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I just want to provide counsel some closing comments and then we are glad to answer your questions and within reason make any adjustments to the program. We really do need your clear direction tonight so that we can go back and be doing the work with legal counsel to do the drafting of the ordinance itself.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That all occur over the next two months while you're in your budget deliberations. And once you've adopted a budget, we would come back with the ordinance itself for first and second reading. We believe this policy has broad support from housing advocacy groups and residents who have encouraged the city to require onsite production, which is what this ordinance'",
        "'speaker_9': 'does. There has been a desire for this policy to go further, for this policy to have higher percentages or to apply more broadly within the city. That's certainly an opportunity for the city over time, but we feel that it strikes the correct balance based on that economic analysis for this moment in time for the city's first inclusionary'",
        "'speaker_9': 'policy. If we strike a policy that is too aggressive, will actually end up with less development, including fewer affordable units. The development community expressed a desire for a flexible, voluntary approach. So in the end, whether you were a housing advocacy organization or representing developers, you'd not get everything you wanted in this policy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what this policy does reflect is everyone's input and a sweet spot between those extremes that is workable for the city. This project's not subject to secure. The development that will occur is consistent with the land use element that was adopted by the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And with that, we're excited to answer your questions. And again, what we're here for today, the recommendation is to give staff and the city attorneys specific direction about what should go in this ordinance that we would return to with those amendments to the municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you very much, Mr. Koontz, and thank you to the staff for all the work on this. We have a motion by Councilmember Pierson, a second by customers and day house customer piercing is going to make some some comments but then wants to go to public comment first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Customer Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you here. Thank you, staff. I wanted to make some brief comments before the community has an opportunity to speak and then bring it back so that we can ask some questions of staff. You know, the staff just mentioned this would be our very first inclusionary policy, which I think we long many of us have long waited'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for. In 2009, we advocated for an inclusionary policy in our downtown plan. We know that cities like Irvine, Los Angeles, Seattle's and other have an inclusionary policy that allow for our communities to be diverse and to thrive alongside each other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're in a moment when we've spent months talking about how black lives matter and the fact continues to be repeated. The 63% of black women are rent burdened. We have a new study that came out from USC that expects our homeless numbers to rise, and this COVID situation has continuing to get worse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know that there's fear from many of a recession, and we also know that there's fear of many of homelessness. And so I wanted to make comments tonight. I know that this is a citywide policy. I know there's impacts directly for the downtown and surrounding areas, but really a comment of inclusion and dialog.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope that we can work together as a council to meet the needs of our entire city. I know that my district is 70 80% area too, even though I do have the downtown. And so I definitely want to work together to get to an agreement that brings all of our residents to a place where they can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have affordable and safe housing. So with that, I'd also like to just say that we received several letters from the Dolby Iam, CMA and others asking for us to be thoughtful about how we're including those at the bottom end of the income bracket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I look forward to hearing from community members and then bringing about. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Clerk, why don't we go ahead and do the public comment then?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First we have Elsa tongue. Your state. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's try to start my time now. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor and council members. My name is Ailsa Chang from Long Beach Forward. And I'd like to start by asking you all, what kind of city do you want?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we want for the future? Do we want integration or segregation? Inclusion or exclusion? Homes or homelessness? In this moment of racial reconciliation and housing catastrophe, I hope we all share the same vision. What that means in terms of tonight's item is that council must adopt a citywide mandatory inclusionary policy with the same triggers that require new'",
        "'speaker_2': 'development in every corner of the city to build or contribute to the supply of affordable housing. The map and attachment e is redlining 2.0. That not only does not help to desegregate housing, but also exempts the vast majority of the city because the policy triggers are vastly unequal to ensure no displacement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The policy must institute a no net loss requirements for each and every project, which means that new developments must replace on a 1 to 1 basis existing units that are affordable to lower income folks. So if you have a 100 unit building and all 100 units are occupied by lower income folks, do you want to redevelop this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'building? You have to preserve 100 units of affordability, not just the 11 or 12 units under the inclusionary requirement. Finally, 100% very low income targeting. The fact of the matter is very low income folks have three times.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Jan Victor Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Honorable council member is my name is Jan Victor, an organizer with East Yard. I work with residents across the nine districts and an overwhelming majority of our residents are renters. I stand with the Housing Justice Coalition letter submitted and would like to highlight these three points.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need to adopt a citywide mandatory inclusionary housing to require affordable housing and new developments. As someone who immigrated to the United States and first settled in Long Beach 27 years ago, we need to give opportunities for long time residents and new residents who want to call this city home, not just in the downtown and midtown area'",
        "'speaker_4': ', too. We need to ensure no more displacement with a no net loss requirement for each project. And three, the city needs to target all rental inclusionary units to very low income families. My aunt, her partner and son have lived in Long Beach for 30 plus years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She's a renter and has never been able to buy a home. The rent for the small apartment that is one bedroom is 1150 with her Social Security income. They are barely able to make rent. She's one of many Filipinos and other black PRC residents that can barely make income to support the multiple people in their household rent'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to the huge burden. Owning a home doesn't seem like a possibility. If you're going to make an inclusionary housing policy for residents that are committed to living in this great city, for people, whether they are born in the US or integrated like me, who want to call this city home, a better inclusionary housing policy needs to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'made. Please make the changes articulated in the Housing Justice Coalition letter. Don't move forward with a policy that falls short by thousands of residents that want to continue to be part of the community. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Next, we have Susan Brown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Suzanne Brown and I'm a senior attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles in our Long Beach office. In light of covid's disproportionate impact on black residents and the city's reconciliation process, equity should be at the forefront of inclusionary housing policy decisions being made this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city should target 11% of new rental units to very low income households who earn $56,000 a year. These are Long Beach working families who are struggling in our rental market. This also aligns with arena numbers, which state that we need over 7100 very low income units to meet our existing housing needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is almost double the amount of our low and moderate income Rita numbers, which are at 4000. Anything less than 11%, very low income rentals is not an equitable policy to address the housing needs of moderate income households.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city should target 10% of new ownership projects to moderate income families earning up to $93,000 a year. This approach is a fair compromise and equitable because it addresses both the needs of residents struggling in our rental market, as well as residents struggling to purchase a home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your consideration of our comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Your next speaker is Victor Sanchez. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Honorable Mayor and City Council. My name is Victor Sanchez, the director of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in a Healthy Community. I'm asking that you think about the laid off workers tonight with respect to this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The one to financial security have been destroyed by this pandemic, the ones who have to rebuild their livelihoods and only hope to be able to afford to stay in the city they have called home for generations. These are your hotel, retail and other critical service sector jobs that have made Long Beach what it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They need an inclusionary housing policy not just because it's the right thing to do, but because they should be able to afford rebuilding their livelihoods in the city they call home. That's only possible if we center the challenges of the most vulnerable in this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think about the very low income working families and consider these amendments. Once the inclusionary requirement for rental units should be 11% and 10% for ownership units. This was recommended as part of the original study and is not only reasonable but balanced to include no net loss and net gain requirements for all development in all submarkets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We want addition, not subtraction, especially given Long Beach's greener goals. Three. Remove the phased in approach. Exempt projects that have entitlements at the onset of this policy. But don't press pause unilaterally when the need to build as many affordable units is too great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And lastly, make this a citywide policy to directly combat the legacy of redlining in this city. New development across the city must be required to build or add to the supply of affordable housing so we don't repeat our history of mistakes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Remember the workers and please meet this moment by passing this policy with the aforementioned amendments. Thank you. Next we have Dave Shukla. Your time starts now. Hello. Dave Chappelle, third district. I'd like to speak now in support of the item, but in support of the Housing Justice Coalition letter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Three points. We've already heard about them. But very quickly, we definitely need income for local residents at 11% and 10% to moderate income families. Second point. But we definitely need a no net loss requirement to replace affordable housing 1 to 1 or every project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then third, remove the phased in approach, make it apply to the whole city and in specific to my case. I grew up in the third in a really nice neighborhood. My parents, after renting for more than ten years, grateful to buy a house that we've lived in for the past 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was only possible because Margaret Brown, the first black college counselor in the city at me City College in the late fifties and early sixties, fought the FHA redlining in our neighborhood across the street from Cal State, Long Beach and nice neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for years paid our mortgage and five vicious covenant. Racially restrictive language and culture. And I would like to see a fourth option at it to remove these absolutely unenforceable legal restrictions. Racial restrictions on who can live where.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because that didn't work for my family. I turned out fine. I went to the best schools. I'm here helping out my town, like should work for everyone. Our goal should be to keep people here. That should be our goal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First and foremost. Those most fun. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jordan Win. Your time starts now. Hi there. Jordan Winn, second district. I would like to cover all of the points that everybody has previously addressed. First and foremost, we don't need a phase timeline.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've been working on this in 2012, as was remarked, to waste another five years until this action take full effect is absurd. We need to make sure that in lieu fees match dollar for dollar the actual market cost of the units that are being sacrificed on the ground so that we are not losing out on the money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we need to actually create affordable housing. We need to make sure that this inclusionary housing policy, the 12%, applies citywide. And more importantly than that, we need to make sure that our focus on these rental units, on these affordable developments, is deeply affordable for very low and extremely low income earners.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we're talking about moderate income, we're talking about families that earn at least $90,000 a year in the median. That kind of income should be focused towards ownership. We should be trying to move families that are earning that much towards home ownership, towards building wealth, instead of focusing our efforts on creating more rental units for them to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'waste their money on landlords, especially corporate landlords, are likely going to be affected by the policy. We need to bring these people into homes that they own. And save the rental units for those who are struggling in our city right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are over 60,000 individuals who are paying 90% of their rent to their housing right now. And that number is going to go up way more after COVID 19 is over. It's going up right now as we as we sit here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we need to make sure that our units are dedicated to very low and extremely low.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. The next speaker is and Cantrell. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. Hello. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Hello. Your time started.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. I'm concerned about the recommendation that this project is within the scope of the previously certified E.R..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not think that that is the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Case.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Low cost housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Has very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Different height requirements than those in the elderly. A document in the staff report indicates that to be economically feasible for a developer, it will be necessary to build a 185 units per acre. What height building does this require?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what about added traffic to residential neighborhoods with the added number of people? Air quality schools. Not only an amended E.R., but more public.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Outreach is needed. Before you approve these changes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not opposed to low income housing being a part of my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If there are few.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Units in a building and the building locations are spread out, the building is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Constructed in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Accordance with the height and density that were defined in the Louis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Environmental reviews are conducted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the public has an.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Opportunity to comment in the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Planning phase. Staff indicates there was a notice of this hearing published in the DG in May and written notices were sent to all city libraries. May I remind you that many libraries, many citizens do not read the press telegram and that libraries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have been closed since March. Thank you. Our next speaker is Robert Fox. Your time starts now. Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Yes, we can hear you. Oh, good. Thank you. That's a little confusing here. My first time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have to echo a lot of what people have talked about. I totally support the no net loss issue here. I've been doing the math and the section one A and one B. These are the areas where we have already the most affordable housing in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm concerned about the new fees and other projects like Park Improvement, etc., that they can developer can use in order not to provide the low income housing. Low income housing is 5050 $6,000 a year. Very, very low income is $34,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you're talking moderate income housing, that's about 85 to $90000 a year. And you could buy a $500,000 condo with that kind of a salary. So I'm concerned here about displacement more than anything else. If we're going to build 180 units, they'll take a block normally on a block in midtown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have over 150 people living in moderate to low income housing. So where can they get rid of 180 people? And we're going to produce 22 units inclusive of moderate income. Out of those 22 units, only five are very, very low income and five are low income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there is going to be an exodus of people who are already suffering now having no place to go. I don't like that. And the and the cost factoring on this is pretty disturbing. Thank you. Our next speaker is Benita Shah Malone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It is my understanding. Thank you, first of all, for hearing from us at District four. We want to thank Mayor Garcia and our wonderful councilman, Darrell Supernova. We are concerned that under item 19 would allow developers to get density bonuses to build low income housing in our city, including areas regarded largely residential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The density bonuses could increase height with more smaller units. No parking guarantee. And I have to echoed the sentiments of our earlier caller that shared that our neighborhood is extremely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Concerned that there was really no public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Input. We as a community would like to have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Input on this matter because we are concerned. We are concerned about the traffic, the density. We all agree that we definitely do need more low income and low, low income and moderate income housing in Long Beach. But where and how is the question?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we would like to be included in on that discussion. Because of the pandemic and many places being closed, we have not had the opportunity to have input and we would like to ask that this item be put off until there is more community input.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our next speaker is Clark carelessly. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. This is calling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Leave this district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Although I do not object to adding low income housing in our city or in my neighborhood. I do urge you to vote no on this because of how it is structured and also because there are changes to definitions under.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Agenda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Item. I think it's 26 that affect the land use plan and will greatly change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All the plans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My objections are as follows. Zone one and Zone two idea should be removed. It contradicts the Everyone Home policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Says that homeless facilities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Should be built.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Across the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your document excludes downtown and midtown from low income housing installations going forward. Downtown has been this has already displaced the low income population and has installed high end luxury housing. It is considered to be gentrified. We would be rewarding bad behavior by excluding the downtown area from an issue that requires our united efforts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the term is inclusion, let's include downtown and let's look back at no net loss. We have lost a lot of our low income housing through what downtown has been up to. Do's and don'ts. There are laws such as AB 1763 that encourage large development by providing height and density bonuses if a developer will commit to 100%'",
        "'speaker_2': 'affordable housing. As I understand it, large tracts like the Kmart area in the South could obtain a density bonus and have three stories to become a five story or more facility.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Our last speaker is Mike Merchant. In your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, mayor and council members. As you all know, I've represented multiple developers over the past ten years and Long Beach. I've only seen two market rate projects outside of districts one, two and six, and that was in five and eight over the past, probably about past five, five or ten years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The reason why developers are not building in those districts three, four or five and the east side of Long Beach is because the cost of the land, the cost of construction, the fees associated with it makes it extremely difficult to do market rate housing and pretty much impossible to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Low income and moderate moderate housing. So the council's looking for more low income, moderate income housing. They need to take that into account. The cost of the land. The developers have to focus on that. The developers focus currently today on districts one, two and six due to the old housing stock in our city, and that will continue'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So I just want to let you know that my clients support staff's recommendations. Thank you for your time. Thank you. That concludes. We'll be coming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Back. We're going to go back to the council and I'm going to start with make of the motion councilor of yours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you to all the community members that spoke today and sent us public comments as well. In 1/2. I think as I as I mentioned, I have some questions for staff. I asked for the PowerPoint to be sent, but I haven't seen it yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going to ask that staff go back to the slide that had the amendments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We could have the PowerPoint back. We'll do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know. And while we get that up, I think, you know, I definitely agree with a lot of the comments that I that I heard tonight recognize that we've done a lot in the downtown because we did maybe our housing stock is different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The property values are different. And whatever we can do to make sure that. That this policy is a policy that affects us citywide, even considering that there are different triggers. So I know that there was two different numbers that were out that I've seen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I have in front of me a very low income army of 56,000. But what you have here. So we do have the same numbers. 56. Very low. 67. Sorry. Low income, 67. Very low of 56. So the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know Christopher the. That we had a little bit of conversation about this. So you're confirming that the low income is not 90,000, that it's 67,000.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct. So low income in this report was defined as 60% of AM I. It is described different ways and different reporting, including up to 80% of AMI. But AMI is about $77,000. So whether it's at 60% or 80%, it's going to be less than that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And my own number of 77. So in our use of 60% in a four person household, low income is an income of 67,560. There's an HD publication on the Internet floating around that has a typo of the hundreds of statistics in the chart.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The one that is incorrect is the four person low income in Los Angeles County. I wish that were not true because that number seems to have been repeated in a number of documents that are available online. But these are the accurate numbers at this point in time, and they were the basis of our study.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But these numbers change every year. We get them from a CD. And they would be adjusted in the program on an annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So one more question about data, and I wouldn't so hard about these numbers, but if we're going to be all of us tonight that are looking at how to adjust, the percentage needs to all be based on the same information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the list that I have and possibly it's from the data that you're talking about, has that very low income bracket as 31 to 50% of am I. And that low income is 51 to 80%. And so that 90,000 is the 80%, not 60%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's the high end.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But but again, it's still an incorrect number because area median income in Los Angeles County is about 77 to $77000. So 80% of 77,000 would have to be less than 77,000. So obviously, it's not going to be 90,000 number.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we use the midpoint and I'm going to ask Kathy from KMA to explain why we use the midpoint rather than the range.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the midpoint on all of the brackets. Right. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's that's correct. So if we could have just one moment. Kathy heard from Kaiser Marson, our consultant is going to provide you some additional information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, council members and Mayor. I'm not going to belabor this point, but it is a very strange circumstance that HK actually ends up with a low income that is higher than the median. This is this started in 2002.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what it relates to is if you look at the chart, if you look at the OECD chart online, you'll see the very low income line. If you take that and multiply.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It by two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then you'll get what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They call for the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Purposes of then calculating low income. They call that the median, and then they take 80% of that. The problem is, is that the low income, which is actually numbers produced by HUD, very low and lower, produced by had because of situations having to do with Section two, Section eight program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is now actually 112% of the median. So what the city has done here on the chart and in their policy is they've actually used a mathematical number of what the actual median is. And then and then 60% of that, that's absolutely appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in in fact, it's the way affordable housing cost is calculated. And so it's very confusing. I can spend a long time on it if you want. But the numbers for how you would calculate rent are the numbers that they have on the chart here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. That is helpful. And I needed to show that we are clear on that because I wonder if we thought there was a difference of 2000 and between low income and moderate that would change what our conversation was moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I appreciate that clarity. Let me go back to my questions. And so understanding the AMA numbers that we have, looking at the sky numbers that are current, I show that are skog numbers, very low income is 7000, roughly low income 4000 low and moderate 4000 is that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What you reported on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's for our next round of arena. But that does sound roughly correct from a percentage standpoint. If we exclude the market rate units and are looking just at the income restricted units, it's 47%, very low, 26% low and 27% moderate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for that. And looking at the numbers that we've developed over time, I see the difference in those and in appreciate that you brought up the five projects and that we've got a 144 loan developed and 129 very low developed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we talk about the percentages, your report shows that we could go as high as 11% for very low income households and submarket. One being able to do that is something that I personally would would love to be able to get to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is my goal to get as close to 11 or 12% in very low income as possible. And that reason is for the reasons I mentioned above previously, which is that we have a homeless crisis that's already here and on the cusp of getting worse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know that we have a great need for this population and that there needs to be additional resources for this. And so when we're looking at the percentages, if we wanted to get to 10% of very low income, but I understand there might be other conversations about moderate, what is your recommendation staff to be able to get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to as opposed to 10% very low income.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the the policy consideration about that mix is for council to decide. You know, we have provided some options and the planning commission considered this and has provided their input to you. If you're solving specifically for maximizing very low income units, there is a scenario by which we have a 12% inclusionary requirement that is made up of'",
        "'speaker_9': '80% of those units being very low income and 20% of those units being moderate income. So that's one option that's available to the council, among others, in addition to the options that are outlined in your staff report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I know some of our my constituents have asked this question. When you say 12%, you're really talking about 10%, very low and 2% moderate of the whole process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sort of it gets tricky because of the size of the denominator, but we start with the whole project. So a project has 100 units if there's a 12% inclusionary requirement. 12 of those units are going to be affordable.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then we get into what level of affordability among those 12 units, and 80% of them would be very low and 20% of them would be moderate. So because of the different denominators, I think it actually comes out to 9.6% and 2.4%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But if around then your number of 10% is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Just try to make sure it's easy for for easy as possible for everyday folks to do. Think about what this looks like in real time. I would like to ask about a no net loft policy. It was brought up by several people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's something that I fully support. Is that something that we could include alongside passing this tonight, or is that something we should include in the actual inclusionary policy?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So council member from the stop table. The city is already subject to knowing that loss. If it's the desire of the Council to enumerate or elicit that in our municipal code, we'd be glad to do that. We'd work with Mike and Charlie to make that happen from the legal side.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It wouldn't necessarily go in the exact same section of the municipal code as this policy, because it would apply to the development of projects, sort of with or without this inclusionary policy. So I think it's going to go in different sections of the code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But if if that's a part of the council's motion tonight, we'd be glad to work with city attorney to make sure it's included.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you for that. And I saw that when we talk about the in lieu fees that we talk about an in loofah account or fund. Is there a reason why we're not putting that into the housing trust fund?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or can you legally talk about the difference between those funds and where those funds will be used? Councilman, this is Linda Tatum. And essentially the funds that are generated by this program would be established in a separate account.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, both of the current housing fund and this fund, would you be used fundamentally for the exact same purpose, which is leveraging any other outside funding sources for the purpose of constructing affordable units? So we say creating a fund, but it would be used in the same way that the city's current affordable housing funds are used.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. There's not a reason for just making it. Putting it into that background and not really. I mean, it's it's it can be done either way. Okay. I'm not particular. I just I know we've talked for ten years plus about having a housing trust fund with no money in it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And wouldn't it be great to stop talking about that and put money into it? Okay, I'll continue on my mind. I'm almost done, guys. I really appreciate everybody's patience with me today. For Area two, as I mentioned earlier, the city of my district is an area to when we did the land use element.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was critical for me to be able to increase density on areas like Sylvan Street so that we would be able to have an inclusionary policy that would really address that corridor's dire needs right now. I do have two developments on the street currently that people are looking at that aren't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think one of them's entitled and one of them isn't. Can you walk through how this policy, if past as it is today, would affect my seventh and Redondo corridor?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. Councilmember So in both of those scenarios that you're talking about and within Area two, those projects require zone changes. So the requirements of the inclusionary that is in front of you would apply to those projects. So there's two different scenarios that are important to understanding Area two.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The most common is the land use element has changed, but the city has not changed the underlying zoning. So that's going to be the case on your seventh street property for something on Redondo. They need a legislative action from the city and that legislative action would trigger the inclusionary requirements at the same rates and same requirements that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'apply within Area one. There's a more narrow circumstance where the city has changed the zoning and the general plan amendment and all that project applicant needs is to obtain what's called their site plan review and build their project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Under that more narrow circumstance, the requirement would not apply for inclusionary at this time. This will be evaluated annually and at such a point as there are sufficient activity outside of downtown, the policy can be updated to eliminate the difference between Area one and Area two.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But to go back to sort of the zoomed outlook, the whole reason that we have an area one in an area two is because there is a statistically insignificant, very little development in area two and we have to make a finding and present what the impact of this policy would be on development.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there's not development to speak up to start with, it's very hard, actually impossible to show that the inclusionary policy would not further diminish that development. I think we've worked cooperatively with this council to pass the land use element to do a good amount of planning, and I think we have some exciting projects coming up in actually'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Council District eight, which I know it's not your district, but I think over the coming year, two years, we will see a good increase in the activity in what's known as Area two and that would provide a future council the flexibility to revisit the differentiation between the two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And I think that I hear I hear that comment, and I also recognize that we've done a lot of work to get development in downtown, and that's why we have such changes there. You mentioned in the plan and you mentioned in your presentation the density bonus conversation that's going to be coming up our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On Thursday can if the density conversation happens, what are some like for Seventh Street for the ones that don't have entitlements yet or might not need to do a zone change or density bonus would still pertain to them because it's citywide outside of the inclusionary policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct. So there's a state density bonus law that applies in all of Long Beach and in all of every city and county in California. Those bonuses allow for up to 35% additional density and allow a developer to request up to three incentives.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'An incentive could be a slightly reduced setback in some circumstances additional height. It could be an adjustment to a minimum balcony size. But it's it's fairly narrow. But it is the incentive program that exists. It's not being used to the degree that we would like it to be used.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Today, in the 29 recommendations, mayors 29 recommendations, there was discussion of increasing the utilization of density, bonus and marketing. That program to that end were updating the city's own ordinance and it will have additional incentive. So you would have to put in more affordable housing, but you also would be eligible to get more than a 35% bonus'",
        "'speaker_9': '. You'd be eligible to get more than three incentives. We have to work through all of those details with the Planning Commission before we bring that back to this city council in the fall, other cities such as Los Angeles and Oakland, you may be familiar with Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A program called Tier C or Transit Oriented Communities, has been extremely successful in expanding development, including in areas where they weren't seeing development and producing a large number of affordable units as a result. So we have similar aims and that work is ongoing on a on a separate parallel path.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for that. And my my last question is about the phase in I know that some people on council, it might be their end all die on a situation. Others might want it to happen right away. I think I recognize that in the next year we probably are not going to see a lot of development, but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that I also recognize we're going to have a lot of need. And so I appreciate the way that this inclusionary would help clear the path to make sure that permits are going faster, that we can fast track this without additional costs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What would happen if we. If we if we shorten the timeline from what do you have now five years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a four year phase and as per year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For your two or three year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. It's it's hard to evaluate exactly what a change from 4 to 3 would do. It would increase the amount of what we call market shock, which is during the first year after the policy. That's just projects can't happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Transactions can't happen because the market has not been given enough time to adjust. I can tell you in the extreme, if we had no transition whatsoever, so if we went from zero inclusionary requirement overnight to a 12% requirement, what happens in that scenario is that you have some period of time where you have no development because existing'",
        "'speaker_9': 'property owners have certain expectations for either the development of that property or the sale of that property. And all of those expectations change with the inclusionary policy. And it takes sellers time to make peace with the reduced potential sales price of their property.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And actually, development can't happen until the transaction occurs because you have to, in a way, reset the underlying land cost so we can go into more detail if if the full council would like to. It's hard for me to say that exactly what would happen in that three years instead of four years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it is highly critical that there be a transition. We felt that four years was appropriate. The Planning Commission thought that it was appropriate. But it's up to it's up to the council to make that final decision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Understood. Okay. I think that that is the majority of my questions. I, you know, closing remarks before I make my motion. I, I do think that the downtown and midtown, which covers the first district, the second District, the sixth District, and a sliver of the seventh could burden a lot more of the lower income housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think that it's redlining, but I think that it could definitely exasperate some situations and understanding that if we have lower density buildings in other areas, maybe it's a four story building that has inclusionary, but that's still a lot of great opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm going to make my motion, but I really want to make it so that we can have a point of conversation for the entire council. I look forward to hearing from my council colleagues. I hope that they take this comment with genuine partnership, and so I move to amend the stock recommendations as follows.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Target inclusionary rental units at 11% of very low income and submarket one. Add no net loss requirement just so that developers must replace any units that are occupied by affordable or lower income households. I'm okay with that being along the same track.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, staff sees that that should be done and I'm open to other council conversations on that. Apply the inclusionary housing requirement. Actually, I'm not going to. Not going to do that once based on staff reports and increase the in lieu fees so that they are set at the economic equivalent of providing affordable units on site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is extremely important. I want to make sure that we are not incentivizing people paying a fee instead of developing the units that they need to develop. Remove offsite compliance is a mean of providing units. Require affordability covenants for both rental and ownership units to be set at 55 years or the life of the project, whichever is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'longer. And. That is my my current motion. I leave the rest to hear from my my council colleagues as it pertains to the rest of area too. And I might have some additional changes as we go on. So I look forward to the dialog.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hours in day out of the second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You, Mayor, and thank you very much, Councilwoman Pierce. And it has been a long time in coming, so thank you. First of all, I would just like to also thank the staff who have been working for a very, very long time and have been trying to bring something to us to the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that inclusionary housing was a topic of conversation for a very, very long time. So I'm happy to be able to be here at this moment and be able to participate in in the decision making of inclusionary housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also have been hearing a lot from residents in my district that this is a big issue in my neighborhoods that we face every day. Right now we are facing a crisis. And I firmly believe that we we must address this crisis with all the tools that we have and use this inclusionary housing policy to bring to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bring forward some. You know, change in the positive way and relief for all of our all of our neighbors. Based on the key findings about the the needs in housing, we can all see that a very, very low income is needed very much, twice as much as others.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that's very important. I believe that in order for a policy to be successful, we we can we can. We must actually we must need to devote a lot of time and effort into providing and bringing forward an inclusionary housing policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With that said, I support Council Woman Pearce's motion of 11% for very, very low income. And I also would like to hear from the rest of the council, our colleagues on this and may have more thoughts later. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Customers in Dallas. I do have some customers of queued up. I'm going to go ahead and jump in. Obviously, this has been a policy that a lot of folks have worked on, including, obviously, the staff and a lot of the council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to thank Council Member Pearce and customers in Dallas for their comments. I want to just I want to make sure also that I heard the motion, but I want to make sure that I'm also clear on exactly what the motion was as being presented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think staff may have had like staff to respond to them just to make sure that there weren't. I thought there might be a legal issue I had understood with staff earlier in the day, but maybe staff can clarify that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe they've clarified that already. Can we maybe Mr. City Attorney, can you reread the motion or staff? And then I'd like to have Christopher kind of go through each one of those and then I have some comment as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. something and Mayor Garcia, it's Mike Mays. As I understood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilwoman Pierce's motion, it would be to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Include an area one.'",
        "'speaker_4': '11%, very low income, a requirement of no net loss. Number two, eight, number three, an increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the in lieu fee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To be equivalent of the construction costs for actually building the units on site. Number five, there would not be an ability to do offsite.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Construction as an in new.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Measure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And number six.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Properties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That qualify would be restricted for 55 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or the life of the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whichever is longer. That's what I got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr. Mayor can have. Thank you very much for that. Can we can I start asking just I know we had some discussion on the offsite issue. Can we get some legal clarification on that? Because I thought I thought that I had heard that that was not possible.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if I can start from from south and then we can help from the attorneys to things, just so we have clarification on the the motion that the fees actually relates to the net value of the unit and we understand the instruction to maximize those fees in terms of the offsite, that's an option that's available to smaller'",
        "'speaker_9': 'projects. On a 10 to 20 unit range, we are required to provide alternative means of compliance. And this was an alternative means of compliance. We have written the policy to comply with that state law and at the same time provide every incentive to provide the units on site and every disincentive to providing them offsite.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In order to provide the units offsite, the developer would first have to entitle their affordable project and begin construction on their affordable project and then obtain the permits for their market rate project. We don't believe that any developer will do that, but our hands are somewhat constrained in our ability to remove that provision.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We do understand and share the desire to have the units located within the project and we think that our policy goes as far as possible on that. The 55 year, the 55 years comes from state law. That's not to say that we can't do something different, but we would end up with a policy where these mixed income'",
        "'speaker_9': 'projects would have a longer affordability range than our 100% affordable projects. I think we need to do some work with the attorneys to think about whether that's defensible. And then we also would be creating an obligation which doesn't exist in other projects throughout the state.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we have to think about whether our construction lenders and permanent financing would be available to builders in that unique circumstance. So we would not recommend that, but it's up to the council and and we may not have all of those answers at this time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the other part about the motion is we understand the 11%, if the council went with that, it would apply to both area one in area two, because we're trying to not have a difference between the two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I'm fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I think it's might. Yeah. Thank you. So. So I want to go. Just continue so I know. Okay. So that clarifies my questions on what I thought were some of the legal challenges on on those issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if the attorney can clarify those, that would be great. Just moving on from those issues, the increase to two in lieu of just 2 to 4 for parity, I think that's a that's a good idea. I think that's that's something that if there is not concern to establish concerns from staff, I'd like to hear from I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'haven't heard any concerns on that issue. We obviously want as much we want people to get to build affordable housing. I certainly like what was said around a housing trust fund. And Councilman Pearce, I want to thank you for or for the comments on that issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Koonce, did you what did you on the no net loss policy, can you explain how that would how that would the relationship between a policy like that and the one we have in front of? And would they be separate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So they would fall within separate sections of the municipal code. But it's perfectly staff can certainly work with legal on that and we believe that under state law we're already subject to knowing that loss. But if there's a desire by the Council to also adopt that as a local ordinance, we'd be glad to work with Mike on'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on doing that. We were just disclosing that it won't be in the exact same architecture or part of the code as the inclusionary policies because it would apply and it already applies to any project sort of regardless of if inclusionary applies.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So for example, inclusionary is not going to apply to a unit projects, but no net loss applies to eight unit projects. If someone proposes to demolish an eight unit building that has six affordable units in it, the new project must have at least six affordable units in it and must have at least eight total units in it'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So that's the concept of no net loss. The concept has existed for a long time and density bonus, but it was applied more generally to all projects, beginning with changes in state law that took effect this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And that was my question. I was under the impression that we were already working with some type of no net loss. Rule step by step by step. I wasn't sure if it was statewide or if it was a federal HUD related issue, but obviously if we want to have our own no loss policy to kind'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of mirror what's already state law, you know, I think that that's fine, obviously. And I think that just kind of reinforces what the what the policy I believe already already is. And so I thank you. Thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm just to other broad comments and of course, I want to hear from, from, from everybody else as well. Uh, I want to, I know that staff on the using in and that's been, I've heard from you Mr. Koonce multiple occasions in this Tatum on how important that is from a perspective of easing in the market.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Obviously we want to get housing created quickly, but I know that that's been something that as far as when I asked when I asked all of you what was the most important feature of, uh, of the report in your best opinion, um, as staff you are, can you at least came back to me and said it was'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the phasing in? Is that correct, Mr. Koontz.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. And if the goal is to create affordable units, we have to have the phase in. So I understand the immediacy of the issue and the need for housing is is huge in our city. But if we don't do the phasing correctly, we end up with what's called a market shock, which would be no development, which'",
        "'speaker_9': 'would be a failure in terms of the immediacy need for housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then lastly, and I think I'm obviously open and I think for the councilors as well, I think Councilman Pearce brought up shifting the percentages as presented by staff and moving those around. So I look, I'm looking forward to seeing what the council has to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to make sure that I certainly would support what would. I'm just curious if we were just to use like the Reenen numbers as a guide, what would be kind of percentages be as they relate to the staff proposal?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Have you met Mira at all or. No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is an option that's available to council. We there's many options and we just need a clear direction on what we're doing. So if we were to go with Rina, it would be 47%, very low income, 26% low income and 27% moderate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So okay, that's that's the overall. And when you say 27, what I mean is within the bucket percentage that staff is proposing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it would we have not run that exact scenario, but I can tell you would be between 12 and 14% would be the overall inclusionary requirement. And of those affordable units, 47% would be very low, 26% would be low and 27% would be moderate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So okay, that's that's helpful. I appreciate that as well. We'll get it. And I'm open to that discussion. Just do what the council's got to say there, too. So why don't I just keep going? I'll have I might have more at the end, but I have a long list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me get to the list of folks and I'll start with Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. I'm going to if a few comments may come back and make more later on after reading from our comic colleagues. So let's start off with. So I feel like we got some clarity. But Mr. Collins, if you could just clarify what is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know there was again that this discrepancy that these numbers in 90,000 was low income. What is the low income number?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the low income number for this program and for all statistical purposes, for a family of four, the low income number would be $67,560.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So for very low income, that's a family of four making 56,300 and below and a family of four under low income is 67,063 or 67, would you say?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm going to just go through all three numbers so I'm less confused, at least the for a four person household. Very low income would be $56,300. Low income would be $67,560. And moderate income would be $92,700 for the full household.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Okay. So the next thing, I'm just going to keep going here. So I heard the proposal come in lieu fee. I think making that consistent with what the market rate of the on site affordable rate is, I think that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there's no gaming of the system. So support for that recommendation is on the discussion on the covenants. Why did staff recommend 45 separately from the motion on the floor, which is 55?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's what's recommended under state law. But that's up to the council to make a final determination on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So there's no economic impact on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The longer the affordability covenant, the greater the theoretical cost to the holder of the property. But the asset is largely depreciated at year 45, so I don't know that the difference in those ten years is significant. But we did not do that analysis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Let. I agree that, you know, it's probably negligible the difference in if it adds ten more years to where the city is, in fact, those units, I think we should certainly stick with 55. I'm not supportive of the phased in timeline with the motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the motion, the four years of was it to go down to three years on the phasing?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There wasn't anything in the motion regarding the change to the phasing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Well, just to be clear, you know, I think a phrase phased in is important. But I think given all that's happening, we're going to be reviewing this ultimately anyway. I'm okay with going to three years on phasing, but sort of maintaining the reporting that's that's proposed here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know it has a three year check in to come to the Planning Commission. I'd love if the motion were to reflect the checking that comes to the full council and maybe some annual two from for a report on how we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I feel like the reporting there's there's some work that needs to be done there. But you know, if there's interest in making it three or four phased in in front of sort of four, I'm okay with that. I think a phasing makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't want to shock the market, but I think three years is enough time for us to sort of evaluate and if we make changes, we can onward to know net loss. I'm supportive of the discussion that we've heard on the net loss, whether it's connected this policy or separately.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd love to hear back on that, but I'm supportive of no net loss. I have some discussion on Area two. I love that. I'm glad to hear that the council districts and Area one of District two, industry one we've heard from already.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But my district and sirene area two. Now the idea that inclusionary would trigger a certain set of triggers that wouldn't trigger inclusionary. I know that every housing development that's taking place, whether it was rehabs or new development, it's in my district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's taking some sort of incentive from a city, whether it was a redevelopment property where we have leveraged land, revetment land to make it happen or if it's an incentive. For example, the Ramona Senior Apartments, I think we gave a $1,314 million loan to help make that project happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We haven't had any any development that's just simply been driven by the market. So I understand I understand and support the the idea of making it a trigger. If there are incentives, then it triggers the inclusionary requirement. However, one of the biggest triggers is to be able to take advantage of the density, and the land use element'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would require a zoning change. While in uptown we're going through the up planning process and that means it's going to be an entirely new set of zoning documents that developers and everyone can benefit from and modernize some of the very outdated zoning the north lobby.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What that means is that trigger would essentially be eliminated. So if you're already guaranteed those benefits through the land use element and the planning process, there is no trigger to trigger inclusionary. And I'd like to see inclusionary, especially if there are specific, you know, specific plans that allow benefits, you know, incentives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We should tie those to some some level of inclusionary housing. Now, I also know that not every area in Zone two has specific plans. I know there's work being done down on Anaheim and Pacific Highway and up North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have some. Is there a way, Mr. Coombs, for us to look at Area two and figure out a way or the specific plans in Area two to address inclusionary housing so that they don't just eliminate the trigger? It's it's, in fact, calculated and factored into whatever specific plans we do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then conversely, make sure that there is some reference to specific plan areas in the area to inclusionary plan, include what that's going to draft. How would you approach this issue?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, Councilman, I don't think we can do a theoretical analysis on every neighborhood of Area two as part of this process. But let me tell you what I think we can do. Area two today does not support viable development, at least in numbers that that we can analyze.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But you are correct that the city is making a number of zoning changes to increase development capacity. And it's also looking at our incentive structure, including density bonus. So specific to the zone changes that are occurring in your district and Councilman Austin's district that comes back to council in September.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'd be glad to work with a consultant team to do a specific analysis of what, if any, inclusionary requirement could be placed on those specific properties. It's going to be different on a project and Councilman Andrew's district, it's going to be different on the other different project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Councilman super nice district. So certainly the ordinance that we bring back to you could say that. Area two is triggered by a zone change, central plan amendment or other triggers as specified in specific area plans or zone changes so that you have an opening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I just want to be careful not to prescribe what might be right for your district, may well not be right for a different district. And we don't have the logistical ability or the finances to do those theoretical pro forma as on every unique neighborhood in Area two.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I do have the capacity to address it for the instant projects in your district and to provide some greater flexibility in the program per area, too. When we come back with the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think the right way to go about it, if we have an opening created in this ordinance and then the economic analysis is done on a neighborhood level. Sure. That those neighborhoods go through a specific planning process like what we're doing in uptown.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That way we can sort of tailor what inclusionary housing looks like based on those market conditions in those areas. I can tell you that the dynamics in North Long Beach are going to be, you know, in a project that say uptown comments going to be very different than a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'PCH is going to be very different, but they're both in area two, I think. I think we need to be intentional about making sure we address the connection between our specific plans and those our specific plans and the inclusionary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How important is supportive of that approach? I think want to hear more from the council about about what the levels are. I think there's I think there's certainly. I certainly want to see an increase in very low income.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's important. I want to also make sure that we we address low income as well. I know that our arenas, we have arena requirements that I'm supportive of that sort of trigger that sort of stagger it across different levels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that very likable, very low income is hard to approach, hard for us to build. I know that that's what represents a lot of our essential workers, our home care workers. A lot of our frontline workers are very low income.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also know that, you know, the those the numbers that we're just provided in terms of $67,000 for a family of four is still also low income. And that that could be a teacher. That can be, you know, a lot of many of our city employees, you know, and acknowledge that know that our city employees, our nurses'",
        "'speaker_3': ', our teachers wrote a letter actually advocating for very low and low income targeting in this policy. I want to acknowledge that that the workforce and working families are speaking up and telling us what they need. I think it's important that we're responsive to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's important that we sort of we listen to the four council members that represent those four districts, just the way that I would expect people to listen to me if we're talking about the ninth District, North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to hear a bit more from the council, but those are my comments for now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I want to thank the city staff for their work on this. Councilmember Richardson took the words out of my mouth that the letter was excellent and our teachers with a stay at home parent could be in this low income category.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just really appreciate the work. I've talked to a lot of residents about it and it is frustrating when I hear certain individuals, whether it's at a community meeting, which I went to one last night and it was socially distanced and outside or whether they're calling in for public comment, but stating things that are factually incorrect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or fearmongering. And so I want to make sure that when I go to a meeting that people are getting good information. So I think it's important to kind of highlight that. No projects are yet starting and that this is a step in the right direction for us to address some of some of our issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The median rental price in Long Beach is low because there are so many individuals who are in buildings or units that have not had rent increases in a very long time. But individuals who are trying to get a rental unit often do face a harder, more challenging processes and competition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we do need to make additional housing. And $60,000 per employee isn't what people typically think of as low income, especially with the number of families that are fortunate enough to have a stay at home parent with their young children.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is is the right thing to do. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, staff, for the discussion and for the briefing that I'm sure we all got before council meeting tonight on this topic. I know this is something we've been talking about for a very long time, and I appreciate the council comments on it, especially the council members who whose districts will be most'",
        "'speaker_2': 'affected positively, hopefully, as a result of this policy. I do have a question for staff. Is there anything regarding the motion on the floor that's concerning at all about realistic implementation? Because I know that when we look at these policies in other jurisdictions, there are some who have been very successful and other cities that were very, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, had high aspirations but were not very successful. And I just want to make sure that we're we're not being too aspirational with our motion tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for the question. Council Member I think we already discussed with the Mayor that the offsite has to stay in the ordinance for legal reasons. The change from 45 to 55 years. I totally understand that the desire to have longer periods of affordability that will have some dampening effect to make the construction of ownership projects less'",
        "'speaker_9': 'desirable to potential developers. But we cannot quantify that. So we certainly can implement it and and would be glad to do that whatever the Council's final instruction is in terms of the motion on the floor. It is a different affordability mix than than what the Planning Commission and staff recommended, but we would have no logistical or legal'",
        "'speaker_9': 'problems implementing it if that was the desire of the whole of the Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then what about the three year phase in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I. We think a four year phase end would be better. But if the the whole of the council would like to do a three year phase, then we can make that work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So it's not impossible for staff. We're not setting you up to achieve goals that are not possible with the motion. Councilwoman Pryce, this is Linda Tatum. I just wanted to weigh in a little bit further regarding the 45 versus the 55 year period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know we often talk about the the ownership mix here in the city. And one of the other frameworks, frameworks for that policy, aside from the financial implications, is that it's that's also an incentive for ownership. I think, you know, in the most recent years, we have not had a lot of ownership projects built.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in a sense that that lower number of 45 for ownership projects is by policy, a way of incentivizing ownership projects. And we think that that's a good thing. So staff still firmly supports maintaining the 45 year period for ownership units because we think it'll help incentivize the option for or the opportunity for additional ownership units in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the city. We just don't get a lot of those. So every opportunity we have to to push that, we think it makes sense as a city policy. Okay. All right. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then I think I spoke with Mr. Koonce about this earlier yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I want to talk a little bit more about Area two. I know that when we talked outside of council meeting, but as you were educating me on the topic and I think you've alluded to it tonight, there is the reason we have to approach different areas differently is because of really a lack of data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think what you've kind of described as really you have to have a different approach for each area based on the circumstances and the factors. So can you speak to that a little bit more in terms of why we can't have general policies that would go to all areas in the city?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there's a requirement under state law that while you can adopt an inclusionary requirement, it cannot be burdensome to development. So I'm going to invite Cathy back up to the microphone to talk about how we did the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in my late summary or in my summary, because we don't have data from area two, it's it's very hard to draw conclusions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again. I'm Cathy Head.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll just amplify what Mr. Quinn said is it's not only a lack of data, the reason there's a lack of data is because there hasn't been development. And a key component of inclusionary ordinances from the state's perspective is that you not create a constraint to development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so if you're already not seeing any development and then you add another set of restrictions that in a way act as another impediment to development because they add to the cost without adding to the value. Then there's a very strong argument that you're constraining development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other issue is the way we do the economic analysis is we look at what's actually being developed in a community. So in each community, I do this and we look at the actual types of projects being developed so that we can assess what the impacts are of imposing an affordability restriction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, when you don't have any development to assess, then you don't have any way to figure out the impact. And so the only way around it in a community where really through multiple real estate cycles there hasn't been development, is to try to do exactly what the staff recommendation is, which is to say we're going to try'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to create a carrot to incentivize development in these areas. And then as part of that, we're going to impose affordability restrictions. And then to then added codicil to that even is we're going to stay vigilant on that to then figure out if development starts happening in a part of areas of area two, then we're going to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'able to jump in and modify the ordinance accordingly. So I think some of the comments that were have been made by the council people have been really excellent, including the notion of, you know, what do you do if you've changed planning requirements, etc., is to then be sure to look at what those impacts are at the time'",
        "'speaker_2': '. But really, as we sat and I looked at all over all over the city when I did the analysis and as I believe was mentioned earlier, there's just been such a negligible amount of development that you can't reasonably impose another restriction on it until development starts occurring.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It makes a lot of sense. I appreciate that and I look forward to hopefully having more developments in different parts of the city that would warrant and welcome some of the housing that we talked about tonight, specifically in regards to workforce housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you very much. And I have no additional questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for this. You know that conversation all the time to people and it's, you know, a community environment with Liam thankful that we have having this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The camp is not your idea. This is a conversation that is long overdue. I'm disappointed again. The fact is that in midtown and downtown, we talk about equity and everyone's taking responsibilities to help with the housing crisis. Yet we make no effort to expand policies across the board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think you do need to have a second look at. I want to be supportive of a policy that adds housing units, but those that is most need but also for our working class families along with worldwide cardboard as a prime example of the need the workforce housing for our nurses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think there's a cost and metro drivers. We do not know how fast we're going to come back from the economic downturn. The Corvette is taking a center, but I want to be supportive of a policy that would be clear and conducive for when times are appropriate to build again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need a policy that is fair and does not allow the bills to pay their way out of accommodating low income residents. Because I can remember the years when I wasn't allowed to afford to buy a house and it lets me know and I am looking forward to hearing from all of my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilor Marie Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank my colleagues for the great, great discussion. I think that we worked through everything that I had in mind and guides to even the phasing worked out. At least three year plan is workable and if concerns happen and I'm glad to see that staff is agreeable to that as it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with a lot of things that we're recommending tonight. In terms of the the some of the amendments that were made to the set of recommendations, I think that the staff has been very flexible and workable with with everything that's been presented so far.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I can certainly support all the items that are being put forward right now. But just to be clear out, when we're talking about low income member, very low income, what are those those figures yet? Low income and very low.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are we talking about 57,000 or $86 million figure?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember for very low income. A four person household income is 56,300. A low income household with four persons is 67,560, and a moderate income household is 92,700.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I would like to see if we can increase the very low income. I know when you talk about a family of four, it might seem like a lot, but it's not. I mean, those are when I look at my district, I have a very robust.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Working Families district in West Palm Beach. And I and I think that we need to have a little bit more of a flexibility on that. I know there are some housing projects that may be coming up in my district that I think would be benefit from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From a very low income recommendation there. So I think I will push that a little further in terms of the very low income. And in regards to the. The Area eight, area 11b, I have a very small sliver of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it's still important, obviously, for residents in the district because it does touch it. And I hope that we can work with that as well. But the majority of my of yes, both of us, it's an area, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm hoping that as projects come forward that we still have some flexibility with, especially in zone changes and those that require zone changes. So we could incorporate a lot of these these recommendations into those new projects as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm very supportive of the motion on the floor and looking forward to what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Let me bring this back. Councilmember Pearce, so maybe we can make some clarifications on the motion as well. So just to clarify what I think what we have so far on the floor is the no net loss policy or kind of adjacent type of policy to kind of reinforce what the state has in place'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And we have that on the floor. We have the in lieu increase to kind of raise that so that it's more more equitable. We also have let me just get to really briefly, customer appears on the on the 55 year question that is in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What where are we at with that issue?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're asking me or you're asking stuff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was asking you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It seemed like Linda spoke to wanting it to be lower because of home ownership. I mean, I'm good with 50 years. I think while State allows us to go to 55, I recognize the home ownership part, but it sounded like 55 have support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So unless there's a motion to reduce that, I'll go with 55.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then the the the offsite issue, the just legal concerns. Can we just I think we need to get some clarification on that piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we could get clarification on that when this comes back, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then let's go back to, I think, the meat of of the proposal. I think you proposed I think your motion was 11%, a very low income period. No low income and no moderate on the rental. Is that was that your proposal?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was my proposal, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And so then on the home ownership, the mix. So the just as I'm quoting, I think staff had proposed 12% affordable. So you're going down to 11%, but making it all very low income and not going to 12%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the staff's recommendation was 12, but it included 50% of that was moderate. I could do 12, Mayor, if I'll even know the even though it's the council. And even though I have a large push for 11%, what I could do is do 12%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very low. I'm sorry. You 12% with 80% of that very low and 20% of that low. And that way we would get that next income bracket. We know that that nurses might start off at very low, but then they move up as their income changes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't necessarily want to make everybody go through another round of changes unless there's another substitute motion on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. No, but we're not I'm not just I'm just just more question. So we're not doing so that the proposal is to do very low income, but no low income.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But also on the floor right now. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Let me keep going through that, through the council. I just wanted to just clarify what's on the floor, I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. Yes? It's Mike Mayes. Well, I just heard Councilwoman Pierce say is that she would be willing to go with 12%, 80% of which would be very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Low and 20%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of which would be low. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Percent would be would be the workforce, moderate housing or whatever that category is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I would be good with that if there's a second motion to that. But if folks, you know, I recognize there's been some conversation, but even though there hasn't been public conversation about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Well, let's let's let's just hear what people folks have to say. Okay. I try to make sure we're clear on what the motion in front of us. Yeah. So, yeah. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's one other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Issue that wasn't raised and that is the phase. And we talked about a three year phased in or a four year phased in. And I want to be clear that I think Janine's motion is to include a three year phased in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll accept Rex's suggestion for a three year. So, yes, we include that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I think that I think that was understood. Let me let me just keep going down and then we'll go from we'll go from there. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. And I was just chiming in. I heard Councilwoman mention either 11% at very low or increase the percentage, the increase in the low. I like that approach of getting more of the project protected and offering more units of affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I'm not going to fight between low and very low. I acknowledge this incredible need at very low. I was that also know that 67,000 a year for a family of four is not a lot of money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are three months kids we're talking about, and they need housing, too. And so, you know, I'm okay with seeing some portion of this split go to low income housing. I think that's fine for me. I would ask that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do those numbers reconcile 80 and 20 or what reconciles what rank and file? Yes, like a big percentage of the you know, you know, higher than 11%, you know, with that split, get us closer to 12 or 13% of a project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, Councilman, there were as a compound question, but I'm going to do my best to answer it. So at 11%, you would do only very low income. And then there was a discussion of 12%. The way to make 12% work would be 80%, very low and 20% moderate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then I also heard if you wanted to hit all three categories. So, for example, at 14%, you could do one third very low, one third low and one third moderate. So there are a number of different scenarios.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I also did hear in the discussion the idea of at 12% doing 80%, very low and 20% low. That scenario does not work. That would result in a cost that is burdensome. So at that 12%, if you were doing 80%, very low, the 20% would be in the moderate category, not the low category.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think I'm one of them. I think what I'm interested in is some split between the like a majority on a very low three in the number show that that's where, you know, probably two thirds of our need is but I'm okay with including some as as low.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So did I hear a number that increases 11% to 13 by having a portion it because I know low income before income is a bit more affordable for a developer to bear. So he keeps at the same economic threshold by perhaps getting us a different additional percentage or two, it costs the developer the same.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is there a way to grow it from 10% to 12 or 13 by including a percentage toward a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the the difference in subsidy is similar but is not the same between very low and low. So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a million different permutations, but what we would recommend is if you want to do 12% and you're trying to maximize the very low you would do of that 12%. 80% would be very low and 20% would be moderate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That would get you the 12%. If you're trying to get a higher total number of affordable units, the amount of very low would have to come down. So that's where we have the 14% and that would be split.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A third, a third, a third. But what I'm hearing from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like the 12% and this small percentage. Okay, I would I would recommend that to council and the peers. I don't want a split between, you know, whose poverty is worst poverty. I think folks are in poverty in the free lunch kids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are working families, I think carving out a portion of this 20% for low income and 80%, which is significantly higher. What is that recommendation was I think is gives us a bit of a spectrum here. But you know, I'm not going to do a subset motion, so I'll just offer that, which is something you brought up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from years 18 to 20. So, Councilman Pearce, what do you think about that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I brought up 8020 whenever I mentioned 80%, very low, 20% low. And stop is saying we can't do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, that's what just that we can do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, no. Council councilmembers Pierson Richardson at 12%. If you do 80%, very low, you're pushing the limit of what the development can bear. So that 20% would need to be at a moderate level. I believe, based on the comments we heard from all the council members, that the idea was to maximize the very low units, but a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'get above 11%. So to get to the 12%, that 20% of units would be at the moderate level. And just as a reminder, a moderate unit, a moderate, moderate income family is $92,700, which may be a lot for an individual's income, but that's an income for a family of four, you know, so conceivably of raising children and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'paying for a two or three bedroom apartment. They're significantly rent burdened even at that income level today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Christopher. If it you know, 1% doesn't make much of a difference. I'd rather just keep it clean. And our ordinance, you know, it supports it creates very low income housing, which is the gap.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've built a lot of low. A lot of the incentives and subsidies around low. And the we're targeting the ownership around moderate. I've talked about homeownership. We need to add more incentives, down payment assistance. I'm okay with where we are.'",
        "'speaker_3': '11%, very low. So I'm supportive of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just to clarify that, the motion on the floor is 80% very low, 20% moderate income. It's a three year phased in. There is a no net loss provision. There's a new increase. We're at 50 years and the offsite issue will come back for a legal analysis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. City Attorney, did I get that all correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think so, Mayor, although I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm still not sure about the split between the 80 very low and the 20.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The staff has the staff has that breakdown, though, that can get you the exact.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Mayor, can I have Christopher respond to that a little bit? I think we've got a little variation in the motion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Christopher Well, first of all, what we heard in the audio here was Councilman Richardson say, no, I'm okay with the original motion. So we believe that the discussion on the floor has to do with the 11% very low.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That said, we did discuss a different scenario, which was 12%, which was 80%, very low and 20% moderate. But what we just heard was Councilman Richardson say to Councilmember Pearce, no, I think we'll keep it with the 11%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a need at very low. So we do need clarity from the staff table about that. And there has been much discussion about that three years versus four years. But in the original motion, there was no mention of that three years versus four years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we from staff need clarity on that. And the motion was 55 years, so not 50.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, and I get the 55 years wrong. So we have 55 years. Well, let me get Councilmember Pierce. Are we a 55 or 50?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We talked about 50, but we're 55. And so I do want to clarify that emotion, right, myself. Everything you said is correct, except we're at 55 and we're still at 11%. I think that some people might be getting confused because we had a lot of dialog about it, but the motion on the floor is 11% with 55'",
        "'speaker_2': 'years and everything else that you mentioned. Okay, we're good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So so just to clarify, then, we're 11%. That's very low. No net loss in lieu 55 and the offsite legal analysis. Is that correct, Mr. City Attorney. Gotcha. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We. We. As the phase in. Is there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anything in the motion about the phase in three or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Four years after recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The phase in is at three years. I think the correct answer appears yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So I think we got I just want to make sure that staff attorney do have all of the the bullet points. Yes. Okay, great. Okay. Thank you. With that, we're going to go ahead and go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the motion. There's a motion to second on the floor. Madam Clerk, please do a roll call vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District two.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'On June 29th, I ask Commander Lopez and Mr. Hauber whether fingerprints could be collected from empty fireworks boxes and remnants, which we find all over the streets to assist in citations. Commander Lopez confirmed that although it's not a current practice, it's a feasible strategy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the city prosecutor confirmed that fingerprints are useful evidence for him to bring in court, likely in conjunction with other evidence. So how can we ensure that this is followed through on? I'd like to see this become a more regular practice as a way of sighting people after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Since we all understand that it's extremely difficult for the police to catch the perpetrators in the act of possession. I'd also like to see new legislation allowing for vehicle impoundment and fireworks cases so that fines can be enforced and collected more easily, as is already done in Pasadena and South Gate.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'My heart jumped out of my chest. My dogs ran in and went into hiding. This has literally been our lives for over two months now. We don't feel safe. We can't relax in the comfort of our own home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Every night after dark. Our dogs hibernate and don't even go out to pee. They panic and pace around the house. Their little hearts beat so fast that no supplement or medication makes a difference. Hiding in closets and under our bed every night for three months is no way to live.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My husband and I both have serious and successful careers, and I'm not exaggerating when I say the sleepless nights filled with anxiety hindered our productivity massively. We reported the fireworks coming from the same location and same people multiple times, along with proof, but nothing has changed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The low number of citations that you asked indicate how the issue is not being addressed like it should be. Every year we travel out of state for a few weeks in June and July, and this year, due to COVID, we were stuck in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I have to say that the impact of illegal explosive fireworks was so immense that we're seriously considering selling our house and leaving Long Beach unless we see some drastic steps being taken by our city officials. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Upon calling 911. It took 30 minutes for the police officers to get there. They were very nice, but told us that the video evidence of explosives being detonated was not enough for them to issue a citation. This is contrary to what we were told during town hall meetings about illegal fireworks and what we needed to do to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'report the individual. I am asking the city council members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not to brush this problem under.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The carpet, but to start a campaign now to combat the influx of explosives that will start coming into our city just in time for the fall and winter holidays. Beginning in October, we will start to experience the nightly terror position of our neighborhoods, similar to what we have been experiencing since early May.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. First of all, I'm not going to think anyone of you council members, because you're doing the very basic minimum of what we're asking you to do. Maybe not people on this call, but people in the city, on the streets protesting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The majority of people are saying defund the police. And here you are doing the exact opposite of that. You're further penalizing people. You're further jailing people for not having fireworks. People are complaining about their dogs. I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I don't like living with fireworks all the time. But you know what? The police, LAPD or El Monte Police Department killed 30 plus people between 2010 and 2020. That's that's scary. And it was interesting to me that Janine Pearce, I believe it was, but the part that the police are stressed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How about the people? How about the people who are continually police? All I hear are helicopters above my house because of the Long Beach Police Department, continually just in their helicopters. But, you know, it's interesting. It's hard to defund the police when the mayor has received over $500,000 from the Long Beach Police Officers Association, his single largest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'donator donor. And this is public knowledge. This is not, you know, conspiracy. This is public knowledge. And this is in complete opposition of what your constituents are saying. But the whole country is saying defund the police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And that concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you to everyone who spoke tonight. As you can see, this has been an ongoing problem here in Long Beach. But I really want to thank the staff for coming forward and putting this item on the agenda for me and also my colleagues who have who are supporting this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, thank you to all those who paired with us for public comment through the whole me being and were able to voice their their frustrations and their experience with us being a resident of the First District. I also had my share of frustrations during these past couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that I think that it's very important to to the community so that we can look into possibly having stricter laws and and adding fines to to anyone with possession of illegal fireworks. Reminder that all fireworks are illegal in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I felt the frustration with some of my neighbors because I, too, was calling in. And I know that it was a crazy night that day. But I don't I don't want us to have to go through that again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nobody nobody in our in our city should have to go through that. So I'm asking staff to please take this item back and come up with some solutions on how we can either increase. I know we can't increase the misdemeanor, but increase the fines that we can attach to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also am committed to working with our state legislators and also our federal ones to try to see if we can really, really enforce something that is going to be that is very problematic to our city right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know fireworks is that is very difficult for law enforcement to actually employ. So this is why I'm looking for other options, because we are putting so many of our residents at risk. We have to think about those who who suffer from PTSD, from being in the war.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we sometimes forget about those are the seniors that that are frightening that every little while it's not a little noise. Usually it's a big, big boom, you know, and the babies who are just scared, much less our our furry friends who are always, you know, scared and can't do anything about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that that's what a lot of our neighbors are very frustrated. One of the things that I also want to commend is the creators like Don K and and Charlotte or or bringing together a group of people in a in a Facebook group, which has grown in the past two months, has grown to over 1500'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people in there that are against fireworks in our city. And that experience this that, you know, every night and still to this night, we we experience that. So I think that this is very important I to my also also don't want to forget to thank our city prosecutor, Doug Harper for for being so accessible to us and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for launching his great, great program where people are actually able to submit their their evidence into this portal so that then he and his office can can further prosecute those offenders. So that huge thanks to him for being so open to the community, for being there and helping to find solutions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that together we can do it. So I'm really counting on us bringing back some really good solutions that will hopefully help solve this this crisis that we have in our city right now. And I know that 4th of July is over, but this is the perfect time for us not to take our foot off'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the pedal. You know, I think that we must really move forward in this and make sure that this doesn't happen again. So now with that said, I'll open it up to my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we have a little situation here. I do not have the the the Rome or the text messaging. And so as an councilmember, vice mayor or mayor or no longer with us. So I will go and district order.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've heard from public comments district to comment on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Austin. I my comment is around the administrative fees. I guess I'm curious for staff. If we increase the fines, administrative fees, where are those fees going once they're collected?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have not assessed that yet. So this was an item that was kind of first brought up by the council a couple of weeks ago to ask us to look more into this. And now this item further spotlights it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we would bring that back. Normally, administrative fees of just in general go into the general fund. They don't go to specific programs. Most of our budgeting, everything goes in the general fund and then you allocate it once a year to the budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I guess I would ask when this item comes back, if it's okay with the original maker of the motion, the members in Davos, when it comes back, we can look at options one for putting it into the general fund and then two of the prosecutor has any options for diversion programs or how we do outreach with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the community that tends to be consistently using these fireworks that we do something to halt the to continue to the world of my friends missing the word you know, to invest in the community so that we're deter I can't say the word keeping them away from doing it again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Councilman Austin, I want to thank those who spoke out tonight at public comment. This is incredibly frustrating and I understand all of your frustrations. In 2017, I believe we started a third district fireworks advisory committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a group of residents who spent over a hundred volunteer hours interviewing different cities, different departments throughout the city. They got data from emergency rooms. They got data for arrests in the city and citations. They just did a tremendous amount of work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They came back with a report that we presented to council. Actually, I can provide a copy of that if anybody wants to email my office, but they came back with a report on some best practices that they had seen in other cities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we actually went to council and as a council action item, asked for specific things to be looked into, like administrative citations, increasing fines and fees. We really have really tried to talk about this issue for years. And it just this year, every year on July the fifth, I get tons of emails from people saying they've lived'",
        "'speaker_2': 'here their whole life and this year was the worst. I get it every year. But this year literally was worse, I think because it started earlier in terms of the number of days before 4th of July and also it started earlier in the day and it went much later into the night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was just a very painful thing to watch and listen to. And I know that in the past I have myself called and when I've gone out on the street, I've heard something and I've gone out and I've called.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And by the time the police arrived, the individual that I didn't even see, I just heard the sound was nowhere to be found. So it's an incredibly difficult situation. It is really like a game of whack a mole for the police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They go from one look at the fire department. They go from one location to the other. And I just don't know the answer. I think that the city prosecutor being proactive with having the homeowners have some liability of financial liability, I think that's going to make an impact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that we need to make sure that our city prosecutor's office is staffed appropriately to be able to have a designated task force assigned to go after the violators that are having fireworks generated from the location of the residential home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If they don't have the resources to follow up on that, then it's not going to be a deterrent, which is where I think Councilmember Pearce was saying it's not going to be a deterrent if we can't actually follow through with the enforcement mechanism.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for me, I think this is a great item. I think there are some statutory limitations on how large the fee can be, but I don't know. I look forward to getting the report back. I think because it would be an infraction or a misdemeanor offense, there are some limits on how much can be charged as a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fine, but I look forward to hearing the report and seeing what else we can do. But we can enact every law. We can enact every enforcement. I mean, we cannot live every law. We can have every deterrent measure in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if we don't have enforcement, if we don't have resources for enforcement, then nothing's going to change. So we need to make sure whether that task force comes out of fire, the task force comes out of PD or the task force comes out of the prosecutor's office.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to be able to fund it appropriately in order to be able to follow through on the threat of punitive sanctions. If we're just putting out there punitive sanctions and we're actually not enforcing it, then no one's going to take it seriously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's the problem. I think we have to follow through with the punitive sanctions that we put out there and we advertise because otherwise it's not going to be a real threat to anyone. So I think this is a great item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank my council colleagues for bringing that forward. I think by now every single member of the council has at one point or another in my tenure, brought an issue about fireworks, which to me. Speaks to the solidarity we all have on this one issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are multiple issues where we don't see eye to eye, but I'm fireworks. I think the council is absolutely united. And so I think together we can try to figure out how to fund enforcement. Right. So that we can actually get a return on on the the threat of citations that we actually do something about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember. Super nor do you have anything to add.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Thank you. Just a couple of quick comments. Thanks to all those who who called in and expressed their opinions. Uh uh uh uh uh. Councilman Price mentioned the third district task force, and I just want to give them credit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, and they certainly reached out to our staff and they're perfectly willing and do city wide efforts. Just regarding the issue with the city prosecutor. Um, you know, being able to enforce since just the first year on the portal, um, I would suggest are reaching out to the city prosecutor's office just to get the data, that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is how many enforceable violations they receive. Just so we have some numbers to crunch on that. Um, I think that's all I have, so thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I'd like to thank Councilman Van de Haas. I plan to continue to the city managers offer us on this. I've met with several individuals since. I joined the Facebook group and even since the 4th of July, and I have some ideas that they've brought to me that I think we kind of talked through and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'kind of came up with together. But I want to definitely give credit to some of these individuals and talk about some additional options. I've also talked to some police officers, not necessarily any that were actually featured in the videos on the page.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think it's important also to hear from them on what we can do to help them and incentivize them to give out more tickets related to fireworks. So I know there are laws in the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know many people want either quotas or an incentive program for the police officers. And there are laws that I've talked about with individuals, but I know those individuals have talked to other individuals. So I just want to kind of talk through that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then I hope the staff report will kind of outline the limitations that are in place related to those items. As a previous councilman there stated, we don't have the determination between a misdemeanor and a felony. However, what would be ideal is if we could really target your multi time offenders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there are a very small group of individuals who are lighting up fireworks on a continual basis. And so if we could work hard with the enforcement team to ensure that multi time offenders are hit even harder, and so it doesn't even mean that they have to be a multi time offender in the same year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If they were lighting off excessive fireworks in 2018 and then 2019 and then 2020, and they should be coached on what those repercussions are. And since there are limitations to the financial fine that can be provided or enforced, I think that we need immediate assignment to community service.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Literally, if you are lighting fireworks on June 1st, your community service needs to start immediately taking away the time you have available to light off additional fireworks. And we also need to look at. An education program. Perhaps if you receive a ticket, maybe you need to go to a class, an online class that shows bloody photos of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'individuals. I know two years ago we had an individual who we gave him a ticket at like, I don't know, two in the afternoon and by 9 p.m. the kid was and he's probably I remember seeing the photo, it was just horrific.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He was in the hospital. He blown off his hand. And so they need to see the potential personal risk to them and increasing the fine from $1000 to $2000 and talking to community members. I feel that there's been a lot of pushback on the safe and sane firework fines system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of the police officers and neighbors kind of said, you know, even seen fireworks that are legal in other cities aren't really our problem. We want 30 and $40,000 fines for individuals who are lighting off a large supply of the fireworks that are really being brought in from out of the area, that are very detrimental, that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'made them 100th all of those. And and the reason that the fines should be so high is because the cost of that inventory is high. And so what what I was hearing from one of the police officers was that he was like scoffed at when he gave $1,000 ticket a few years ago because the guy's like, Look'",
        "'speaker_2': ', I brought in all this stuff. I've got $30,000 in inventory here. What am I going to do with it? It's dangerous to leave it in my garage. Of course, I was going to light off all of it tonight, and I'm just like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So hearing these stories firsthand really add some perspective. People are bringing in third. They're probably bringing in $100,000 in inventory that they pay $40,000 for. They plan to resell it on $100,000 range and then they didn't sell enough.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so then potentially, since COVID was so strict, they didn't have the sales they had. And so these individuals were just lighting off more and more. I don't know. Those are all anecdotal things that I've heard from community members, but I really feel strongly that the community is demanding community service and direct education for those who have'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Been caught lighting off fireworks. And then if city staff could just answer to me because I'd have the same challenge as some of our community members and council members in terms of there was a question asked at a previous community meeting in talking to a police officer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He thinks that the answer was given based on the question being different. So I think we need some clarity. Can we talk a little bit about the fingerprinting issue or could that come back in the staff report? Because I think we're getting mixed messages on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This time. Yes. We need to come back in the staff report and we can answer questions about fingerprinting. I believe technically it can be done. It's just, you know, a matter of resources and and forensic staffing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, there are times where we have in home invasions and we aren't getting fingerprints. So I just think it's really important to add the perspective.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then also, I know that I kind of talked about this a little bit with one of the individuals who even spoke tonight was in the fireworks group. And when you run fingerprints, I think it's important for the staff report to discuss whose fingerprints are even in the system that they have to have committed a crime'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and how that works. So I think that people can understand and then what the turnaround time is and all of those kinds of things, because I think that those are some of our barriers. And then lastly, I want to thank Prosecutor Doug Halbert and the new program in policy that we rolled out related to holding homeowners'",
        "'speaker_2': 'responsible in some cases may have backfired. And I think we need to look at this. There may have been individuals who were reported as setting off fireworks, even though the reporter may have actually been the one diverting the the fine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was actually a neighborly dispute. And Doug was so kind as to take a personal call from a landlord. And the demographics of his building were just. So unlikely that the individuals who were very ill and elderly senior citizens could have been the individuals lighting off those fireworks on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They had mobility issues and other things that would have prevented them from running away from the lighting quickly. And we had had individuals in the area quickly after the lighting and so it wouldn't have been possible for the individual reported.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think we just need to look at how to ensure the validity of a lot of these and then with the report could also include related to using video data to prosecute these individuals and hold them accountable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm really interested in that. I think that's the way forward. And if there is a significant fine structure, I'm supportive of maintaining a $1,000 fine for your safe and saying, but when you have individuals who you have a block party and we had one in the unincorporated area where all the neighbors in the unincorporated area adjacent to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the fifth District have each agreed to pitch in $100 to pay for the fine. The fine is not enough. And on top of that, they all pitched in to pay for the fireworks. I mean, these are the anecdotal stories we're hearing from the neighbor who lives just adjacent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Her dog actually got out from being scared and was running through Hartwell Park. And it was really an unfortunate situation. But with that, I also want to thank Supervisor Janice Horn's office for all her help and the Lakewood Sheriff's Station for their help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we we need to do more. So thank you. And I will continue these discussions over the next several weeks and look forward to working with staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council member council member, Urunga. Because them I want to add my voice to the frustration that's being felt out there, not only with the citizens who have called in today, but also with our council members. I mean, we all face that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That frustration, especially, I guess more so us because, you know, we get people to come out to our doors and say, what are you going to do about it? Look at this. Hear this? You know, I have it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have the same frustration in my area we call in. It takes a while for our PD to respond. And, you know, I'm the council member, so it affects us all. And we all feel the frustration. And this is hopefully a step in a process that will get people more serious about using fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they have an excuse because as we've as we all know, it's not only about pets and animals, it's about people. And people also suffer PTSD. They hear an explosion and they start getting nervous and edgy. And you don't even have to have that used to be out, you know, enjoying your TV program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then you hear a very large explosion and then here go the cars. With your alarm going off and and they stay on for a while because people aren't paying attention to your car. You're not home. So it just don't keep pace, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're going through it is is another step in that process. I really appreciate the cast member Mongeau for her ideas, being innovative and creative and and trying to see more what more we can do to ensure that fireworks get under control or rephrased.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we don't usually stop using fireworks as a whole in general. But again, if we have neighboring cities who are legally selling. Quote unquote, safe and sane fireworks. We're always have the same problem. But again, those are not the real issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The big issues are the big explosive ones, which I call IEDs and improvised explosive devices. Those are the ones that really create the noise and the and the concerns on the community that those are the ones that really hurt people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you so much. And that's for inviting me to join you on this item. I think it's important and looking forward to report when you come back in 90 days. Thank you. Thank you. And Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember just General Clark. I think we're all in alignment that we should. We should. This is an important issue for us to engage in. Personally, I'm less interested in quotas. I'm less interested in busywork. I'm more interested in outcomes and accountability as both for property owners as well as our own response.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think folks want to know that if they call the call the call center, someone's going to answer and respond. And if they respond, if they catch someone in the act, they're going to write a ticket. I think that's the most we can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, we can commit to those things and make sure they actually happen and do our part. I'm interested in outreach to the property owners months in advance if we know that there are census tracts targeted. You know, residences have been called on in the past.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We should reach out to them months in advance, let them know what the rules are. Let them know that they'll be held accountable once an event. I'm interested in targeted enforcement in those problem areas. We in the council agenda item that that came forward a few months ago, we talked about using data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Identify those problem areas. I think you should start now and start deconstructing the data we have from this year, Independence Day celebrations and see if we can make a difference in targeted area. I think the city has been it's going to be hard to make a big macro difference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we have to target where we can make a difference, learn some best practices, test out some things, and if it works, then we scale it. I'm interested also in giving the community something to do. I know that we don't have a lot of I mean, we have the neighborhood fire roadshow, which is, you know, you can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'come out on your front porch and you just look at the fireworks from out there. But there isn't any any actual fireworks show anywhere close. We should think about. Think about doing those doing those things to see if it has an impact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We should test it. You know, I've gone down to the queen. I've gone to Big Bang on the bay. Great experiences. Let's give the American Biscuit something, something to do so they can maybe save a little bit money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's an official. So that safe home park, something like that and see if it has an impact. So I think we have to start thinking about doing things a bit differently and just focusing on outcomes and accountability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what I would say here in terms of increase the fine from 1000 to 2000. I'm open. I just I just think that that, again, is a is a is. Let me address. You know how we're going to hold folks accountable?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's not going to happen. You know, not not it may not have as much of an impact. It could. But I'm interested and I'm okay with this morning. Those are my comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Thank you. I have Councilmember Mongo. Then I have council members and they have screwed up. I want to just say a couple of words. Alison, we've heard from many residents over the last few weeks. This has been a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A very, very difficult few months. When it comes to explosions and living with explosions and in our neighborhoods to our city. And it was more than just the 4th of July. Obviously, it was a sustained period of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, so much so that I want to say over a month ago, a month ago or so, that I brought forth an item signed on, I cosigned by Councilmember Richardson, Councilmember Zane de Haas, Councilmember and Vice Mayor de Andrews to to ask staff to develop an action plan from that plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did we were able to get the city prosecutor to initiate an innovative portal and letters to to to to property or to residents that that were reported. That was a step in the right direction. Obviously, it felt well, we fell well short of what we needed to do to eliminate fireworks during the season.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will say that we fell short, but. The entire Southern California region fell short. I had to go and pick up my son from a from a 4th of July function in La Palma. It was really no different than Long Beach, Cerritos, Artesia, all up and down the 91 freeway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was lit up fireworks, banks, explosions. And I'm not sure if those cities experienced it to the extent we did, but I can say that this year was different. There was a proliferation of fireworks that we haven't seen before.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think as we look toward next year and moving forward, it's going to require some investigative work, is going to require some work beyond just what we can do as a city to eliminate the. The proliferation in the ports of entry, where are they coming from and how are they getting here in such large quantities to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the fines? Again, I think we just recently raised our fines last year and I don't think that had much of a deterrent. I'm okay with stiffer penalties, but clearly people are spending a lot of money on fireworks as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so there's a lot of disposable income and this is a deterrent that we feel like we can that will make a difference. I'm supportive of it, but I'm also going to go live with my comments because as I mentioned, we brought an item about a month ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We directed staff to get back to us on a number of items. I'm curious, Mr. City Manager, wouldn't you expect to have a report back? I know there's a lot going on right now, but what can we expect to report back on on the item that we passed just a few weeks ago regarding the fireworks action plan'",
        "'speaker_5': '? I'm not sure what to call you, vice vice mayor or something. But, Mr. Austin, I don't have a date yet for that. I think we had looked at about a 90 day, if I remember the item, for the first kind of check in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This also calls for a 90 day. So we'll set our clock to that and get as much information as we can by that time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So those are my comments. And we'll go back to Councilmember Mongo and then Councilmember and ask to close if there are no other comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just really appreciate the comments made about using the data. I'm very supportive of some kind of a letter that is sent to residents who have been reported for fireworks addresses that have been reported for fireworks in the past, something that says, please be advised that all fireworks are legal in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Should you or a member of your household light off fireworks? You're going to be required to do 200 hours of community service or whatever we're going to be able to do. I really think that advance notice to them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd also like to find a way that anyone who is a spectator can somehow, if you can set up your chairs in a way to support an illegal fireworks show that goes off into the air, I really think we need to think about you're really contributing, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you talk about bullying and there's three different levels of bullying. But my and participating condone are part of the problems. We need to look at that, too. Thank you again to all who have participated in this and the several other agenda items related to reducing the firework issue in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is a regional problem, but let's be leaders in making it a quiet and peaceful place with high quality of life for our residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Q and council members in House.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Colleagues, this everyone has had some great ideas. And I think that's exactly what what this item was, why I wanted to present this item. And just to make a clarification, I don't think that we can actually raise the fees on a misdemeanor because that's not something that we can do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but this motion is more for the staff to go and and look at other options that we can include on top of that misdemeanor. So, for example, you know, tagging on community service to that or another fine or violating another thing, you know, the annoyance ordinance or a health ordinance, some things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So all of everything that was talked about today is great. I know that within the community there's also been talk about maybe setting up a reward fund to be able to just you among the people that that turn in, people who are who are doing fireworks illegally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really also like the idea of, you know, the possibility of impounding a vehicle if you are caught with these illegal explosives in your car. I've also seen where, you know, during my research have also seen where cities have actually had checkpoints like we do for drunk driving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had they've had checkpoints to to check the vehicles and make sure that they don't have these kind of explosives. So with that being said, I really look forward to working with staff on bringing forward, you know, a lot of options that we could use and question for staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that the council member asked and also brought up a firework item, you know, the firework action plan. Is there a way to combine these so we can bring back information on this same time?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Certainly. So we can build on some of the research that we had done in the past as Councilmember Price mentioned. And we will combine these two together because they do speak to very similar items and bring those back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're we're hearing you there's a lot of questions that you have, and we want to do kind of a bigger comprehensive report of all the issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I think that that would be a great fit to bring what has come out of the research that has already been done and with creating more opportunities to be able to make a difference for next year and hopefully next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We could say that this year was different because we didn't see fireworks in our city. So thank you again all for supporting this item and I look forward to working with staff on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Let's go to a vote here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one. I District two. I District.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wasn't strict for. District five.'",

They're a wonderful partner. Cannot get into the presentation, but they are actually a little different.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So member Pearce has made a motion their second on the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Second by price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. We have a motion in second. Councilmember peers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Glad to be bringing this item today. I'm happy to have Councilwoman Pryce on this agenda item with us. We know that this week the government has shut down more businesses, more people are going back on unemployment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the situation is not exactly what it was a week ago. Last time we brought this up, I had hoped to do to do more. And this item extends this moratorium until August 31st, which I fully support. If there's support for something beyond that, I also would love to hear from my council colleagues on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Second on this item is we had a lot of debate about the areas that we wanted to include and exclude, and we had previously excluded the Tidelands area, and that was for our intention. I believe our full attention intention was for larger leases with the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's come to my attention that that has not been the way that it panned out. And I have several businesses in the Pike area that are excluded from a moratorium. Meanwhile, we've got small businesses and restaurants outside of that area that are included.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we do not have consistency with our eviction moratorium as it is right now. So I'd like to make the motion to include in this moratorium to extend the eviction moratorium to the tidelands area. Following the guidelines and making it retroactive to March 4th, 2020.'",

I think it's prudent for us as a city to have our own eviction moratorium ordinance, because I am concerned that anything that we would fall into with the county would take into consideration a lot of the discussions that we've had as a city that we have worked really hard to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'try to mitigate impacts for everyone involved. And so I think it's important for us to have our city ordinance be the one that guides this particular discussion. A few things I want to talk about with the Tidelands exemption.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member Pearce is accurate. She's absolutely correct that we exempted Tidelands, but at the time at least I'll speak for myself. I envisioned that it would apply, that the Tidelands exemption would apply to all master leaseholders as well as the sub tenants sub lessees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I did not articulate that. And so it created a loophole such that the small business owners in the Tidelands area whose landlord is this, is a master leaseholder and not the city, have really no advantage and no opportunity to further rents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't think that was the intent of anyone on the council. The purpose of this moratorium is and has always been to prevent and reduce evictions and specifically to prevent evictions as a result of COVID impacts. And so those businesses that are located in the tidelands area that would qualify as commercial tenants and small businesses should'",
        "'speaker_2': 'get the same benefits as commercial tenants throughout the city and should not be penalized because of their location or because of who their landlord is and that it's not the city. So I think that's a loophole that we identified.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to make sure that that that loophole is corrected. I also wanted to note that the retroactive provision that Councilmember Pierce just mentioned is retroactive in terms of the intent of the ordinance, which was to prevent evictions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So anyone who received a an eviction notice as a result of partial payment or nonpayment, this moratorium should extend to those individuals in a retroactive manner for entities or lessees who have already paid within the Tidelands area. Those lessees, those tenants, have received the benefit of having paid and presumably not received an eviction notice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also they have received a benefit in that the amount of money that they will have to pay back in deferred rent will be lessened by the amount of money that they have already paid. So the intention isn't really to for the city isn't really to get into any sort of accounting of rent payments at this point'",
        "'speaker_2': '. For those who have paid or have not paid, the entire legislative intent of this legislation is to avoid evictions. And so that's the aspect of this ordinance that should be retroactive. And I want to make sure that legislative intent is clear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also. I wanted to just make her ask one question. Councilmember Pierce, I know you put it out there as a discussion point, if we wanted to extend it beyond August 31st. I'm not comfortable doing that. I think this is one of those items of legislation that we do need to continue to revisit because of the fast pace'",
        "'speaker_2': 'changing nature of this pandemic. And so I would feel much more comfortable. I think all of us have the same intent to try to do everything we can to help prevent evictions that are based on nonpayment of rent due to COVID impacts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we all are in agreement on that. So I think that as long as we're continuing to bring it back regularly, we can revisit the issue. So I'd prefer to keep it till the 31st. The one question I did have for our city attorney is it is my understanding that there needs to be some sort of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'documentation to show a COVID related financial impact, whether it's a direct impact, such as the loss of a job or a collateral impact, like needing to secure childcare because you're an essential worker or something of that nature. Can you provide some clarity on that requirement, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anthony if you're on the call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly. Can you hear me? Councilmember Price?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yep. So I am on the call and you've stated it correctly. The original ordinance adopted back in March, I think it was, and extended on May 26, requires there to be some sort of a COVID related impact. And you may recall that we had some discussion, the council did, about exactly what level of specificity we would include'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in the ordinance regarding what constituted legitimate documentation. And we didn't get into too many specifics, and I think that was by design because we wanted kind of landlords and tenants and the courts to figure out what was legitimate evidence of a COVID related impact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But certainly there needs to be some evidence of a COVID related impact. Tenants just cannot defer rent willy nilly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I got that. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. I don't think, Mr. Anthony, is there anything that you need further clarification on in regards to either the retroactivity of the tidelands provision or the extension of the moratorium?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There there are there are two things, and thank you for asking. So this question I think is directed at Councilmember Pearce, but it will need your input as the second dir. Councilmember Price and that is tidelands tenancies will now be included in the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I get that I'm comfortable with it being retroactive provided that and I think Councilmember Price, you were clear that rent that has already been paid, the landlords are under no obligation to pay that rent back or otherwise credit their tenants due to this retroactivity that rent has been paid and landlords keep it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what I'm what I think both of you intended, but I'm not sure I'm looking for this clarification is that you do not want to include tenancies administered by the harbor department in the eviction moratorium. And technically those are within the Tidelands.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when Council originally considered this exemption on May 26, I think Harbor Department Tenancies were considered separately from Tidelands. So I don't want to put words in the mouth of Councilmember Pierce, but I think when you say you want to include Tidelands, it's all the tenancies within the Tidelands that are not administered by the harbor department.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, good. So those would still remain exempted. And is that okay with you? Council member Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Good. So that's one piece of clarification I needed. The second one was I didn't quite follow the last portion of Councilmember Pierce's motion regarding requiring the master lessees, who I guess would be the sub landlords to enter into some sort of forbearance agreements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That gives me some pause, but I'm not sure I quite understand that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I. I had hoped to. Yeah, I think the first two are great. And I guess my question, I should have put it in the form of a question instead of a motion. Is there something that the city can do in working with these master lease leases to allow for when they're coming back, paying their rent, that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're paying it based on a percentage? And I brought that up because I know that I looked at the airport lease with our food service and they pay a base amount and then they pay a percentage so that they're not paying the full rent that they were paying pre-COVID.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that might be too much for this motion, but at least one to give staff direction, to have some conversations with the master leases, to make sure that there's some conversation happening between them, because that's not happening right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think. Okay, I think that would be better if it's out of of the motion with respect to the the ordinance I'm going to bring back before August 1st, which will evidence this extension. But it can be its own kind of stand.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It can be part of the motion, but it will have nothing to do with the ordinance amending Section 8.100. It will be just direction to staff to work with cities, lessees to to work with their sub lessees, as you just described.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Does that does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that satisfies me, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. In with that. That's that's the clarification that I needed. But I'm certainly standing by to answer any further questions that may come up. Oh, yes. We have a number of members queued up. We have a council member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Super. Not now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I'd like to thank the makers of the motion for bringing this item forward. I stand in support. I would like to introduce a friendly at this point, and that would be to request to send a letter to the congressional delegation urging forgiveness of mortgages until the pandemic is deemed over by government standards.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we keep talking about the balloon payment and whatnot. I don't know if anyone has attributed a number to that yet, but if my calculations are correct, I think with this motion it'll bring that amount to $9,000 on average per tenant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And another way to look at that number would be this is what the property owners would be out. And so I think it certainly brings some relief to both sides if we could at least make this request and that that is my motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Friendly amendment are freely accepted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is accepted and I would like to add something. I feel like we've all talked in circles about wanting to have the state forgive mortgages, and I thought that we had already given direction to staff to communicate. That is was that happened or not happened?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City Manager No, I don't think that ever was in the form of emotion and direction to staff. So that would be if you're if you're looking to do that, that would be added into emotion tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': '100%, yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And is that supposed to go to the federal government or the state government?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, okay. Great. So next up, we have Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just a couple minutes. So I'm support I'm obviously supportive of that that letter to the federal and state government saying we need federal action. The state government is limited in what they can do. You know, the banks are governed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are regulated secondarily. So. So what I'm supportive of that they are going to say is I think so just looking at the way that our agendas have set up separately from, say, the county that were dark on the last Tuesday, the month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And even this action today is going to require us to come back and take another action next week, and then we'll have to come back. We're going to continue this. We have to come back the first or second year in August.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's only three council meetings in August. We have to come back, revisit this in a matter of two weeks. Revisit the very same issue. I, you know, I'm open to. I'd love to see this go forward for 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think the dynamics are going to change in the next 2 to 3 weeks. If they do, we can agenda it. What I don't want to do this is a full conference. This has been a full discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think we're going to end up with a unanimous vote like we have on just about every one of these these eviction moratoriums. I don't know that we need to come back to relitigate this every three weeks because, again, we don't have a fourth meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm okay with going to 60 days. I'm afraid I'm gonna put that on the floor as a friendly amendment to the making of the motion.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Mayor. Members of the city council. So in 2016, Council adopted the city's Vision Zero policy to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries within ten years. So the action plan before you tonight was developed in a very data driven approach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We analyzed collision data from 2013 through 2017 to identify which transportation road users are most vulnerable. Where our most severe crashes are happening. And what crash types or circumstances most commonly lead to a fatality or serious injury. So in addition to these findings, the plan also recommends seven Keystone actions, and Carl will outline those later in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'presentation. And these will help us meet our goal through a combination of engineering, design solutions, safety, education, as well as traffic enforcement. And it's important to note we aren't reinventing the wheel here. There are 11 cities in California and 40 throughout the country that have adopted a similar Vision Zero plan since 2014.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do know that the cities that have invested heavily in Vision Zero, like San Francisco in New York, have seen marked decreases in serious traffic collisions.

But the goal here really is to ensure that when a crash does happen, it doesn't result in a serious injury or death.

        "'speaker_2': 'And it's also important to note, beyond the tragedy of lives lost, there is also a significant economic cost to consider when we talk about traffic crashes. So based on calculations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration between 2013 and 2017, traffic collisions in Long Beach cost about 1.46 billion from expenses related to medical care, emergency services, property'",
        "'speaker_2': 'damage and lost productivity. And so over the course of the last year and a half, staff has conducted outreach throughout the city to get feedback on the plan. We hosted pop ups throughout the city at events, and we also had a number of focus groups and community meetings with neighborhood associations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We brought a listening bench to our events. You can see that in the photo on the bottom there where folks could sit and record their stories of how they've been impacted by traffic safety. And many of those stories are quoted throughout the action plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, this is a very data driven effort, but we wanted to see what safety issues people were most concerned about in the city. And you can see on the in the pie chart on the right, the top concerns were distracted, driving, speeding.'",

And about half the community also wanted to see engineering solutions used to solve these problems. With the other half kind of split between wanting to see more education and enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So moving on to our technical advisory committee, so we convened a tack that met multiple times throughout the drafting of the Safe Streets plan and contributed their expertize. So we had staff from city departments, including Fire, Health, Police, Department Services, Economic Development and the port.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also had external agencies at the table, Long Beach Transit and Metro staff, and we also had advocacy and nonprofit groups. The Long Beach Gray Panthers were represented. They advocate for older adults, walk Long Beach, walk bike Long Beach and bikeable communities.'",

And many of these folks will be instrumental in seeing that these recommendations are carried out. And so what? We have a lot of work to do and we highlight some of our existing street safety projects in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also wanted to point out some of the education and encouragement programs that our partners in the Health Department continue to do each year. These include things like bike and pedestrian safety workshops, rodeos, pop up events, free giveaways, helmet giveaways, lights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They also oversee our annual walk to school week back to school week and Safe Driver Awareness Week. And it's a lot easier to do pedestrian and bicyclists education because you can kind of stop people on the street. But it does get tricky when it comes to driver education.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm excited they're launching a Drive Safe Long Beach program later this year, and this will include both drug impaired driving prevention as well as distracted driving prevention. So we look forward to working closely with health and all of our other city partners as we start implementing this plan.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'It was great. As Rachel mentioned prior, our report, our study and the things that we had to look at were very data driven and we had to determine exactly how were the majority of our collisions occurring in the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what we found was that speeding was the most frequent violation. The next problem was that people were not complying with traffic signals or signage. And then we also found that bicyclists were colliding with vehicles because they were traveling on the right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The bikes were on the wrong side of the road. Many times there are a lot of other factors involved in. There are collisions and sometimes we don't know exactly what they are. But those were the main three items.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then, although it seems to make common sense that if you get hit by a car going at a high speed, the damage would be worse. We did do some some research and we found these interesting numbers where if you were hit by a car at 20 miles an hour, there would be a 13% likelihood that she'",
        "'speaker_8': 'would you'd experience a fatality or severe injury as speed increases at 30 miles an hour, that likelihood increases to 40%. And then if you're hitting a car doing 40 miles an hour, there's a 73% chance that there's going to be a fatality or severe injury.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, again, if a pedestrian is struck at a high rate of speed, there's a very high probability that you're going to have a severe injury or fatality. And then we went a little further and decided, well, who was getting involved in these collisions?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We looked at what could be done to protect the vulnerable users of the road, and we found that bicyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists make up 14% of all of this, all but 65% of severe collisions. And we also looked at equity concerns.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Many of those who walk or bike for transportation do so for economic reasons or disability. So you can see the charts on the right where we have the percentages of the different modes of transportation and the fact that, again, bicyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists are the largest number of vehicles, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And people who are individual are involved in collisions. So we look at another important factor, which was who was getting involved in these collisions. Is it men? Is it females? Is it people who are older? And what we found is that men and young adults are more likely to be killed or seriously injured in collisions, and that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we can target these target groups, the same men and young adults, to try to reduce collisions. You can see the chart on the right that shows the different age groups and clearly the red or the the males in this study are the higher prevalence of collisions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then we then we looked at the charts that show where are the collisions happening? And we can see that the majority of the collisions are happening on our major arterials. And there is also a high concentration of collisions happening in downtown and central Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, 73% of high injury collision corridors and there are 83% of the intersections are in disadvantaged communities. So we have a very good idea of where these collisions are happening. And our next task is to figure out what we're going to do about it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have seven Keystone actions to to discuss in our plan to help address this issue. First, we have to dedicate resources to the safe streets, Long Beach effort, increased staffing and funding for traffic safety programs and projects.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have to address speeding. And to do that, we have to look at arterial road designs. We have to consider additional enforcement, as Susy Price mentioned earlier. If you don't have that enforcement, at the end of the day, all of the things that we are doing sometimes just are for not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's really important that we have our officers support us in our efforts to enforce our posted speed limits. And then from an engineering standpoint, we have to do a better job in our street designs. We have to reduce areas of conflicts at intersections.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have to build comfortable bicycle infrastructures and routes. And we have to have shorter pedestrian crossings to allow pedestrians to get out of the street so that they can avoid conflicts with vehicles. We also have to have additional education about walking and biking large scale campaigns again targeting drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists and efforts tied to street reconfiguration projects'",
        "'speaker_8': '. We call them roadway safety projects, and we have to do a better job communicating to the public about our designs and what we're trying to to achieve. Item number five of our Keystone actions. We need to collect better data.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, everything that we do in traffic engineering is very data driven, so we have to get better information about how these collisions are happening. We need to improve and be able to be more transparent, providing before and after data to the public and also to the folks that we work with to mitigate these issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have to partner with local, regional and different stakeholders to support safe street efforts. Talk with Metro, Caltrans, etc.. Work on grant programs. Different resources to get funding. As I mentioned, funding is critical. So we've got to work on these different stakeholders to get more funding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Also, we've got to work with our state partners to discuss, to consider automating enforcement techniques. There are ways through automated enforcement that we can achieve some of our ah of our safety goals. As you know, in the city of Long Beach about five years ago, we discontinued our use of red light enforcement systems.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Maybe we should reconsider that or think about that or discuss it. And there are other options as well as far as automated enforcement goes. Item number seven, we need to emphasize automated enforcement and maybe we try to work on getting some automated speed enforcement cameras.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Work on these things at the state level to maybe change some rules, change some ideas. Sometimes these these ideas are controversial at first. But, you know, we can make changes that will be positive and decrease the number of collisions if we increase the number of tools that we have on our toolbox.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, we need to increase community engagement for our transportation projects, and we need to think about bicycle citations, diversion programs, as opposed to citations or fines. The next steps would be to formally adopt our plan to move forward with safe streets.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Long Beach. We need to evaluate resources, priorities, implement Keystone actions. We need to encourage Long Beach community to sign safe a site. I'm sorry. Encourage the Long Beach community to sign Safe Streets pledges, basically as a resident committing to doing things that will make our streets safer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Promise not to use your cell phone when you're driving. Promise to have your phone in your pocket or you're not using it when you cross the street. Have individuals commit to making lifestyle changes that are going to make our streets safer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, safety education campaigns continue with traffic advisory committees, and we're going to also have annual progress reporting regarding our collisions. The numbers that we have and a similar data that we've discussed so far. So, again, looking for formal approval of our plan and we look forward to making an improvement on our streets in the city of Long'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Beach. And we're welcome and able to answer any of the questions that you might have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Hickman, for the great report. We have a motion by Councilmember Pierce, seconded by Councilmember Turanga. We're going to go to Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. I'm very excited about this presentation and this action step tonight. I know that this was something that started with my predecessor in trying to ensure that we had a plan for safe streets. During my tenure, we have talked about Safe Streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Almost every community meeting that we've had, particularly around Seventh Street, where I know we've had a lot of incidents, but also around Broadway, when we decided to slow Broadway down, it was using this lens, even though we had not yet passed a Safe Streets policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'd like to. I know that it's late into the night. I definitely would like to sit down with staff and go through the agenda item and the the policy in more detail. I did have a question on what you the next steps are after we take this vote, how are we engage community members?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then is there a tool kit that will be used as we're addressing other street improvements? I know that we won't have as many as we had, you know, two years ago or three years ago. But knowing that we do have a lot of key areas that need improvements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think what's important is that any particular safety concern that any of the council members might have, you know, we can address those items one by one when we understand and get a better idea of what the specific problem is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we do have a so-called tool kit in mind where depending on the issue or the problem that we have to mitigate, we do have certain steps that we take, certain data collections that we have to do, and then we can, you know, determine what our solution will be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's a variety of things on the table that I'm sure you've all heard of traffic calming. And there are different things that you can do in regards to traffic calming. But I think, again, the report that we presented this evening demonstrates that our data shows that our our biggest problem is speeding in our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's a unique issue that requires unique solutions. And again, I would like to partner with our law enforcement friends and do the best that we can to see that we are enforcing our are posted speed limits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me ask. We have Seventh Street as a main corridor that kind of takes you from, you know, four or five all the way into downtown. And that's the exit you decide to take. Mm hmm. And I know that there's a lot of traffic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there's a couple of fatalities. But I know incidents because we did have Alvin come and present to our seventh Street group at maybe two years ago on a street like like seventh Street, where we have been denied in the past for things like crosswalks that like or Zorba and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could we now go back and revisit our traffic counts with this lens and possibly get approval for additional changes?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, one of the important things to remember is that any of the changes that we decide to implement, let's say it's a crosswalk, or let's say it's even as extreme as a traffic signal. We do have rules and regulations, guidelines that are given to us by the state of California that we need to follow.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, yes, we can always go back and take another look at things, but it's not going to change the requirements that we have to meet to make those things happen. So we can investigate. Again, any of the problem areas that you might have, problem intersections, whatever it may be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But at the end of the day, even though we re-investigate or take another look, I mean, the rules and the regulations that we have to follow from an engineering standpoint are still the same. So, yes, we can take a look and we're always open to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, in case this might be my last public meeting where we talk about safe streets, I would just like to say that Seventh Street needs a lot of TLC, and I hope that we can revisit how we have safety through that entire corridor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So again, thank you for all the work. I know this has been a long time coming for Shayna.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Counselor Bergeron. Good. Thank you custom Embraer and thank you for this report is very timely and that last point you made in regards to from an engineering standpoint and you had to follow rules and regs. That's the most frustrating point for me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've had a number of traffic accidents in my district that have just really been heightened, the importance of safety. And I'm talking about a stretch of road in my district between the 17 Freeway and Santa Fe, where I've had at least five fatalities within the last two years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it doesn't make a threat to you have any kind of. Traffic calming measures such as a sidewalk crossing or a traffic light. And that's that's become very frustrating for me because I got situates within that area who are getting very frustrated because the fatalities are happening not only like in the early evening, but there's a market'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and a and a convenience store nearby, a little strip mall where people have to cross the street and there is nothing there for them to cross with. No crosswalk, no traffic signal, nothing. And so what ends up happening is that the cars are speeding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's about a mile stretch and the cars are speeding along and they don't see pedestrians and the rest is history. So that's a bit of a frustrating issue for me in that respect that the engineering may not be there, but yet we're looking at this program for Safe Streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, I mean, I'm I'm looking at with a jaundiced eye on this world because of the fact that if engineering and and regulations are going to come into play, I mean, it's going to be frustrating all along the way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we need to look at that. The fact that when a death occurs and there is a propensity for accidents in that area, we need to look at it from a different lens and be more accommodating towards what is something there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of course, the big question is where we going? How are we going to find out? Where is the funding going to come to put up a sidewalk, to put up a streetlight, a turn signal, whatever? That that's the other frustrating portion of this is that, you know, funding is going to be critical in this in this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'era of public safety. And yet, you know, during this pandemic and crises that we've had, I mean, is critical going to keep? However, I do appreciate this coming forward at this time. It's important. But again, I'm looking at with a jaundiced eye because I don't see that we can really have real significant change and improvements if we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'still have to follow by some outdated rules and regulations based on engineering. So I'm just throwing that out there. And if I sound frustrated and because my community is frustrated and angry as to what's happening in these areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Question I remember years ago, I recall seeing some kind of report where all the streets in Long Beach were visited and there was like a ranking of the top ten most dangerous corner streets in Long Beach. And the reason I know that is because when one of those top ten streets was on my my district and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'intersection of Wardlow and Long Beach Boulevard, and that was that I want to say about maybe seven, eight years ago before I came on council. Does that report still exists and will you be looking at that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilman Turanga I'm not sure what report you're referring to, but I would be willing to take a look to see if I could find it or I would be able to go out and do another investigation of that intersection.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, I respect your comments about the streets or the intersections that you're concerned about in your district. So please feel free to contact my office and we can open up a fresh investigation of those locations. And again, you know, we do need to follow engineering standards.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I won't get into all the discussion and the explanation and the reasons why during this meeting at such a late hour. However, again, I welcome any investigation that you can present to us. We'll definitely take a look.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate your response tonight. And I do appreciate the fact that the hour is late. And I am talking specifically about marriage in my district. So there will be a hopefully it will be a time where I can sit down with you and my staff and revisit some of these areas of concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is Rachel Junk. And I would just like to point out in the action plan in appendix B, I believe it is, we have a ranking, I believe, top 40 intersections and corridors that came out out of our 2013, 2017 collision analysis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's where we'll be focusing a lot of our attention going forward. So Appendix B has our high injury network.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilmember Mongo, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. A couple of things. Let's talk state law since state law regarding speeding. Does this plan talk about any items that we can bring to the state legislative committee for consideration and advocacy?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There were recent attempts by many agencies within the state of California that presented a bill to legislature to change the way that we set our speed limits. That bill last month, I think it was in early June, was shot down again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Many of the folks want to keep things the way that they've been for many, many years. I won't go into the way that we set speed limits again. We'll be here too long. But. So that item has been looked at and the idea got all the way to the state legislature.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then it was shot down the way that we set our speed limits. Now, what I will say about speed limits is that to support our plan that we've presented this evening, we have already proactively started looking at streets within the city where we can reduce speed limits under the current guidelines that we do have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we're looking at locations, corridors, segments of roadway where we can reduce speed limits on average, typically a five mile increment reduction. So we are already started along that path where we can reduce some speed limits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Alston, who's the maker of the motion to deliver and file. I remember also your muted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Pierce is the maker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Baker. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. So I would like to initiate a receiving file city clerk. Or it's an adoption.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is an adoption of a group.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would like to add a friendly amendment that the plan include strategies to continue to pursue with state legislation. Oftentimes on bills come forward. They don't last their first or second or third time. And we need to be persistent in continuing to change those laws.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are more locally elected individuals who are currently in the state legislature than almost ever before in our history. This is a very recent thing in the last few cycles of elections, and so those individuals are more likely than ever to understand the perils that we deal with in cities like this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would love for that to be a part of the motion. Except in. Great stuff. Are you able to tell me, does this plan identify any specific. Implementations. I hear the strategies that are considered, whether they're lane narrowing or any of these things, but it doesn't say we're going to do a road diet on the street'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or we're going to do this on that street. I think there's some misinformation out there. This is more like a tool kit. Is that accurate?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I think that this plan is a very comprehensive plan, city wide. That's a very macro level. Look at some of the ideas that we have to solve our issues. You know, it doesn't get into the specifics of a project, one or another.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, as we do move forward with this plan and its adoption, we will be getting more specific with our projects, more transparent, more sharing and educating of the public to make sure that we're making the right moves and that our funds are being spent on projects that are accepted by the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, what? Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's exactly where I was looking to go, because when I was elected, I was quickly met with an implementation of a previous plan that I was not even notified about, nor was the community. I will say in the last eight weeks I've received more compliments on bike bollards than ever as an elected because I think that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people are biking to and from. But I still feel that the presentation needs the determination, the implementation needs to have that connectivity that the plan prescribes. And never before have I had people actually ask me for protected bike lanes implementation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my answer to them is, please share with your neighbors and see what kind of feedback you get. But you're not the first person to tell me recently, so I'm just for consideration. As we move forward through COVID, I know some of our council offices are open to allocating some funding, but we need to connect some of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'these bike lanes to parks because individuals are stuck in their homes or having less opportunity and access than ever. I know that on any given days on our bike is our only way we leave the house. So just some things to consider, but most importantly, that council office notification and community input will happen before any of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'strategies included in this this plan are implemented. And so as long as that is affirmed, then I'm more comfortable supporting the plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Councilmember, this is Tom. I want to jump in on that. So you're correct. We are not picking streets or specific projects in this plan. That's very clear. But you are tonight and we wanted to give you this presentation because this this is a policy shift.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is going in the direction of Vision Zero. And we wanted to make sure the council understood that. And so when staff are looking at projects and designing them and thinking about things and doing those outreach, they will be looking at it with this in mind.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we wanted to make sure that you all were aware of that and had a chance to give input. And then of course on specific projects, we will be doing some more that engagement and trying to get some community buy in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it will start with a kind of lens of doing some things that are a little different than just a traditional street in every single, you know, and for every project. But looking at some of those more creative ways to lower accidents and to make them safe for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I'm confident, at least in the presentations I've had from Elvin and others that come to our community meetings, that the team is doing the due diligence that's necessary. And I appreciate us discussing that in detail. Thank you, Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that, I will be supportive of this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember. So this is you know, I've been paying attention to this for a long time. I think the first conversations were back in 2014. The data at that point showed that consistently one of the deadliest intersections was Atlantic and Artesia.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I like where we've come since then. I look at this plan. There's a lot that I write that I like to highlight. So specifically, under each of these Keystone actions, it calls out very easy to understand it because of the timeframe, whether these can be complete within one year and three years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's really easy to understand. I love that. It points out whose responsibility is it to do each part of this plan? It calls out, you know, where does the city council have to take action? Where does the public works department or the health department have to take action?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's that's really good. I'd like to see that utilized more. When these plans do come back. We do we deploy a lot of plans where it says ease of implementation. I think, you know, it's some are very easy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some are very difficult. And it helps set those expectations. So those are are really good. I love that. It acknowledges acknowledges equity. It talks about barriers and acknowledges I don't feel like that. You go to the appendix rather than showing just like the worst intersections in the city, it's more clear and talks about which ones are more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'dangerous for bikes, which ones are more dangerous for cars, cars versus bikes and all these other things. I think it's easy for us to look at it and see that there are certain parts that you see that pop up a lot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just look at these these three or four lists. I see. Well, Street comes up often. I see Artesia Boulevard, the Alamo. That tells me that we we need to be making sure that our investments align with those corridors so we can make them safer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the priority is really to preserve life and have a safer experience, we get what the data tells us. So know I'm hoping to see our teams report above our for example. I mean, that project, it's funding, it's been funded, you know, through metro coffer projects for years and you know, haven't seen a lot of movement on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it. I would hope that when we go forward, we can prioritize, you know, projects like that, big projects pop up on every one of these lists. Yeah, a lot of these Boulevard Artesia down the avenue in Atlantic of Artesia just takes the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Take the money. It's the street. Make it safe right there where an elementary school and high school is. Make it a priority. Make it safe. So I like this plan. I like it a lot. I think I think the message that I'm from I support a Vision Zero since 2014.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I support it today. And I think we should just now get to work. Yeah, I think that's that's all I can for my comments on this. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Members in the House Unified.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council Member Austin. I guess this is a really great presentation and plan. Thank you. To go in your department for this very, very detailed presentation. I think that, you know, it's very needed at this time. I know that we have a lot of accidents in in my district and particularly, you know, some of them are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because of reasons you've already explained in your presentation, like, you know, driving too fast. And I mean, just just weeks ago, we had one of my residents was killed and his his. Dog was killed on Sixth Street and Magnolia and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, it was just horrific. So if we can try to, you know, think about things before this happen, that would be great. I know that, you know, sometimes we we are kind of forced to look at things after someone has passed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think that with this plan, I think that it'll be very, very good to help us in in kind of foreseeing what could happen so that we can prevent. That's another thing that that's been happening in a lot of my in my area is, you know, street racing, which is not good, or showing off with what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'neighbors call cars doing donuts in the middle of the streets or in the corners, you know. Is there anything in the plans to address that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it's important that we address those items with support from law enforcement. We do get notified a lot. Residents tell us that people are doing donuts in the middle of the intersection and that there's, you know, regular speeding and may even know who the person is is doing this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, again, we're going to be looking to law enforcement to provide us that support to to mitigate that problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes. And I I think that one of the things that was mentioned, like you said in earlier items, was the enforcement part of it. So I think that that in conjunction with this plan is going to really help us prevent some of the accidents that could happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm really excited to see this plan coming forward, and I look forward to having you working really close with my office so that we can assist and also tell you what our problem areas are. And you so much for speaking with us to this very late being.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You council in Austin. I just wanted to just take a moment and thank staff. This is a project that I've been aware of for years through my day job and working with knits, and I'm really glad that the city is taking part in the initiative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know staff put a lot of work into tonight's item. I know we're all really tired and we're going to want to pick apart this data. I think individually for our own districts. I was particularly interested in that slide that you put up, Mr. Hickman, showing where the majority of collisions are, the the collision activity throughout the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city. So that's that's a chart I'm going to want to take a look at with you down the road to look at mitigation measures in my own district, for sure. But I just wanted to take a moment to thank staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You guys are just fantastic. And I think one of the most difficult conversations topics that I have with my residents is centered around traffic all the time and changing traffic patterns and traffic calming measures. They seem to be the most passionate conversations that we have at times, certainly before COVID, they were.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think that having this presentation tonight and showing where we're headed in the future is really important. So just to thank you and appreciate the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Supernormal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. As staff reference the hours late. So I'll make my comments very brief. I did have one question about the presentation. I think it might have been on page ten or slide ten, and that is the chart showing the years of the total fatal and serious injury collisions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a reason we don't have data for 2018 and 2019?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So this effort began in late 2018. So we utilize 2013 through 2017 data. Of course, we work closely with PD to keep our collision database fresh in public works. But the in-depth analysis that really fed into this plan was based on that 2013 to 2017 data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you have specific questions about more recent data, we'd be happy to supply you with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I appreciate that. But we have a major policy decision in front of us tonight. It's almost 11:30 p.m.. Beyond that. We've had a lot of experience with some of the principles here, as is applying to our bike boulevards and whatnot in our district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And every conversation I've had has been with a former director of Public Works. So it's a little unfair to staff who's here tonight to go through this stuff. I guess for that reasons, you know, I'll agree with your anger.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If I sound a little frustrated, it's because our residents are and as you mentioned, that ours is late. And for those reasons, I won't be supporting tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I'll take the opportunity to weigh in as well. I did have a couple of questions. And looking at the appendixes, I'm a little confused. One street that I think is the major, major issue, and that is the Alamo Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't see that on the corridors of high injury or intersections or. Of bicycle corridors or motor vehicle or motorcycle intersections. But in the report on page 38, there is at least two deaths on Delamar Boulevard at intersections.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't want to challenge the data here, but maybe I am challenging their data. The Alamo is a is is a street that is as you know, we've we've seen multiple deaths, multiple collisions on that street as a result of speeding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to your credit, Mr. Heckman, to the department traffic engineer, we've really been creative and bold and tried to mitigate those issues. My question is regarding where we're now. Tonight, we will adopt a plan and I expect it will be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a major policy shift in direction and there will be potentially some resource budget implications. I'm curious to know what we have been doing leading up to this moment. Have we not been implementing this philosophy of Vision Zero and how?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will after we adopt this tonight, will things change?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a very good question. And let me answer by saying that as a professional engineer and the engineers who were before me and my predecessors, I'm 100% confident to say that they had safety on their minds. That was their number one priority as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's the ethical code that we follow, that, you know, safety is our number one priority for everything that we do. So I highly doubt that there's any change there. However, what we're doing tonight is adopting a formal policy that city wide.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are moving forward with a formal policy to to create change and to create new ideas and to be open to to possible things that we may not have seen before in our city.

But can you talk to me tell us a little bit about the funding for for the Vision Zero projects that we identified, where we would find'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those find those resources. Well, as many.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As I mentioned earlier. You know, one of the sources that we do have is we we regularly apply for grant sources of of funding, whether it's through Metro Caltrans and even other smaller amounts of money that are available out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when we get these these funds, we apply them to projects and we try to implement our ideas that we're talking about this evening, things to make our roads safer. And there are projects out there that champion our causes that we apply for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We compete statewide, and we are successful in many occasions on getting what we call other people's money. And additionally, we will be moving forward to approach our city manager and others to find additional funding sources to accomplish many of these goals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as we move forward, we want to make a positive change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember, as you and I talked about, this document that you're approving does say that you want us to invest in this and look at this. It does have those kind of goals and aspirations there. The good thing is there are a lot of funding sources out there that are non general fund that help with our transportation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the budget is the overriding document. So every year we have a lot of plans and say these are all our needs and this is what the council has priorities for. And then we look at that every year in the budget.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What can we find to move those initiatives forward and then what the priorities are? So you're not committing today to anything specific. This isn't putting it on a on a automatic payment plan or anything like that. It's but it is saying that this is something that's important and we should continue to look for funding.'",

There's enough controversy surrounding road diets and the vision zero vision that it be in the best interests of the people alarmed to postpone action on this item until after the November election.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Excuse me. I'm a resident of the second District, directly affected by the modifications to the Broadway corridor. I'm especially interested to see the city remain uncommitted on this issue until after either Mr. Fox or Ms.. Allen is elected as they hold largely opposing positions on the benefit of the modifications and their debate should benefit citizens of all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'districts. To the traffic engineer. What does your data tell you about virtually no motorcycle traffic cops issuing citations? No radar speed enforcement cops issuing citations? I don't recall the last time I saw a cop citing a driver like for a rolling stop, which have become ridiculous.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's almost no stopping anymore. What is your data tell you about that? Could increased enforcement by live personnel be constructive there? Finally, I'd like to encourage the council, mayor and city government to honor the spirit of full transparency in their work for the public, not just the letter of the law.'",

When it was reduced to one lane in each direction, it resulted in motorists backing out of diagonal parking spaces into a bike lane and on growing traffic. Having only one lane on a busy street, results in emergency vehicles having to go against traffic.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'In Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm wondering how many of these deaths. Involved alcohol use. Phone use. Many of these things that we can't change. And I really doubt. That all of these efforts to slow traffic down. Are going not going to be worth the.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'No council member. This item does not have to do with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I've literally had to say that 100 times in the last week. Additionally, at meetings, I think that there are individuals that even stated now that they want a conditional use permit and a lot of the properties identified, at least the ones that I've specifically worked on with specific people, have had specific questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They all require conditional use permit to get to the next round of consideration. And furthermore, a lot of the facilities identified as potential allowable have been. Discussed and the possibility of them there in in our lifetime is is is limited because of the current uses and other barriers.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'One, because we're required to do that by state law. But two, because the chance of any individual site developing for these types of uses is so low that we need to provide many, many options out there so that hopefully the market and the funding sources are able to deliver one or two of these types of uses across'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And the briefings that you guys have provided and the questions that I've asked over time and I know this has been a two year project, but I think the main question was related to if there were any portion of a map that was colored.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let's say on a map that has a bunch of red coloring and a neighbor says, I want this one red coloring removed, that that's impossible to do because this is not a change of zoning. The zoning remains in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is the change to the definition of available uses for that particular zone and that we would not be able to exclude any one particular property. Thank you for the question. Councilmember Mongeau, this is Alexis, our appraiser. Yes, you are correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would not be able to change one particular parcel zone as that's considered spot zoning and is prohibited by state law. And we wouldn't even be able to remove a a, a, a section that has multiple parcels on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If it's currently zoned a particular way, you couldn't exclude one or the other, all of them within that zone. Correct. I'm sorry. Wonderful. Thank you. I don't think there were any other questions that came up at the community discussions I've had over the last week or so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to just thank Oscar, RC and Chris and the whole team and all the work that you guys have done. I actually do know one other question you guys answered. There was a question related to the amount of community input.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On this process. Could you give a little bit of background on that? Certainly there were several meetings held, the first of which was beginning in October of 2019 and was actually a focus group with.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'From Long Beach City College, Cal State, Long Beach, Linc Housing a number of other nonprofits. And then we went and did our homework and research. And then eventually in early or late January of this year, we held two community open house meetings, one at the Long Beach Multi-Service Center.'",
