        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, I think as we sit here today, there's a clinic going on at Petro Lane, which is obviously in a very, very difficult part of the city. And we go in there every week and we try to give those kids a little bit of glimmer of hope, and they seem to really be appreciating it.'",

In that measure, there are provisions that will repeals taxes previously adopted in 2010 by city voters related to the sale and'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Vice mayor or members of the council? It would be a competing measure as to the taxing portion of the initiative. We would make it clear in this if it were approved by the council when it came back, it would make it clear to the voters that this would compete with the tax portion of that initiative.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the rest of the regulatory ordinance it would not compete with. Okay. Would not invalidate the regulatory ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. But in regards to the taxes and things, there's direct, direct differences between what's proposed and what this competing initiative.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is correct. And under the election code, in order to be successful, this initiative, this proposal would have to receive more votes than the other initiative.'",

I will say that the taxes that are being assessed for are proposed on this measure with pursuant to manufacturing distribution are entirely within line, reasonable and balanced within the retail sector.'",

If a in a collateral bill from the county also passes, which is going to assess a 10% sales tax on top of that, especially pursuant to the four medical patients, is going to be extremely problematic because one each has passed'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a 10% sales tax on her own just for the city. Combine that with the inability for any of these retail businesses, especially to deduct any of their business expenses because of the federal prohibition on it. And you're going to be tapped out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're going to be making retail outlets essentially unable to function, potentially. You're going to have ones that are going to be well-financed and ready and willing to open, willing to provide good union, local jobs that frankly, will not be able to operate with an effective tax rate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, just adding these all up in my head at this point, you know, they could be anywhere from 50 to 75% with inclusion of the problem from the feds. So please do not tax retail, tax manufacturing, feel free to tax cultivation, distribution, any of those things.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I support the wave of the fumes in the park. So I support being with you when you go by the buildings. I supported the people who are sitting in the cars. The smell of it. I am supporting. True story.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When I was not here from 2012 through 2014. The beginning of 2015 is when I returned back to the city of Long Beach. I was starting initiative services for homeless in Ventura County, helping to augment their services. That is where I have been.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When I was out before you, I was recommended by a parent who was her son. Ventura County sheriff officer said, I want you, my son, to work with your organization. The son had a heroin problem and he was now going through rehabilitation to get off of heroin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so as a pastor and both as a volunteer coordinator, his mother wanted him to work with me and I had a chance to ask him. I said, I have not done drugs. I have not cigarets alcohol is not a part of my daily.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I need your honest opinion. Young man, 21 years old, having come through Cordon Blue Chef training, but he couldn't even use the skill because now he was hooked on heroin. I said, Where do you start? I said, I'm hearing talk that marijuana is the gateway drug.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I need your personal opinion. 21 year old now sitting in front of me needing help. Where did it start? He said Marijuana. I started smoking marijuana. And then after you do that, somebody comes along, you know, they're putting Primos, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're mixing the cocaine with the marijuana. And then we have a had our chief in his absence. I don't see him anymore. But I remember Suzy asked in the chief are we have can handle the the the the outside carriers or distributors or manufacturers of the product.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And she said no, we can handle it. So now we're voting it in anyway any power that is God puts it in office. So he had your chief and all the other police officers tell you we cannot handle this if people who are not authorized to sell this product began to make it illegally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you're voting it in in spite of hearing your chief. So why are you doing that? Understand that God is saying, okay, all of your family members, somebody is going to be end up with a drug habit and they're not going to stop at marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Prophetically, you are giving this order of the day. Thank you. Due process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Time is up. Next speaker is our final public speaker. It looks like I'm going to close public speaking after dark after councilman tauranga and then the speaker's close.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next speaker thank you, diana. La genes. And by the way, welcome to janine piercer, our newest. Yeah, i would actually like to answer that very quickly. Marijuana is not a gateway drug up. In fact, actually, it's used quite often for a gateway drug out of heroin and out of alcoholism and out of those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it is actually an effective drug gateway out of those things. And what I would also say is 600 churches just recently came on board saying that we need to legalize and deal with it as a as a health issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, speaking of being God given. Now, medical marijuana is a miraculous God given herb. This was given to us by God. Thank you. And it treats a myriad of illness ailments that includes cancer, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, PTSD. And I think you've heard me say these things before, but you need to get it, because what I hear is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that it you know, I keep hearing you say things that, you know, well, it's this or it's that. These are myths. Don't perpetuate the myths. It's discriminatory. You've had the opportunity to create a reasonable ordinance, but you failed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You had the citizens put forth their time and money and effort. And now you want to undermine this this effort. And it's totally disrespectful. Now, here we're talking about taxes. Okay. So you're talking 6 to 10 sales. 6 to 8 gross grow.'",
        "'speaker_1': '12 to 15 square foot on the grow. That's besides the 10% that the L.A. C Los Angeles County is putting forward. The state is charging 15%. The state board of Equalization starting charging 10%. Come on, people. How greedy can you be?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, this this showing nothing but greed. Discrimination against groups is wrong. Yet this council and government continues to demonize and degrade people who are sick and disabled that need this medicine. You've got 900 over almost 900 liquid drug outlets in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yet you demonized this this God given plant. So your constituents have voted time and again for in favor of it. It needs to go. You had your opportunity. Let it be. If you want to do something good, bring it back and make it into law now instead of sending it to the voters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the end, we're all have to answer to a higher power. And, you know, I really wonder how this deliberation would go if Jesus Christ himself was standing here. I think he'd be ashamed. Anyway, you're supposed to be representatives and leaders, and we'd like to know when will that start?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speaker. And then we're going back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tony was the wrong address on file. I just want the council to use the utmost caution and be as conservative as possible when it comes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To medical marijuana. If it was my preference.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would not tax medical marijuana at all, but put the burden on recreational.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think, you know, we can't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go to my sister who has who has a husband, had stage four colon cancer. She couldn't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Go to take her Blue Shield card.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And get compensation or pay for that medicine. The Rick Simpson oil that that relieved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Him I think it was Simpson oil something like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That really helped to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Alleviate the pain. She couldn't do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She had to cash in her retirement so that she wouldn't see her husband suffer. He ultimately took care of it by his own hands.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it was unfortunate, but the pain he was going through was just too much for her and for him.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's not like you can just go to your insurance company and say, hey, this really is something that helps and that is proven. So I would ask for you to reconsider. At least take a look at it and make sure that you are you have some.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Consideration, sympathy for those people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who actually use this to alleviate their pain and to use it because they need it. And it is an economic burden as well as a physical one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, I would prefer that medical.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Marijuana is not taxed at all and that all the burden is put on recreational.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I know it's up to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Speaker list is closed. We're going back to the council for a vote. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have a question about this tax. Is it one of the things that I agree with, with one of the comments that Shirley made? Our police chief has indicated very publicly that our police department cannot handle the additional responsibilities that not the legal operations, but the illegal operations would bring.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And what we've seen is in the city of L.A., for example, there's 135 legal dispensaries and over 1000 illegal ones. So it is going to place a strain on our police department. That's just a reality. So the question that I have is, is it possible for us similar to things that we've done in the past to indicate'",
        "'speaker_10': 'whether it's tonight or at some point down the road, an intent to spend the money on public safety so that the money that's generated through the taxes goes back into enforcing the operations. Because I'm sure that even the legal operators will want the police's assistance in shutting down the illegal operators.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we're going to need to have some money in enforcing the operations. And could this tax be used for that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. City.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Attorney. Thank you, Mayor. Members of the council, the tax revenue and the way I understand the motion, that the motion would come back to you as a general tax, which would go to the general fund and then allocated by the Council as the Council deems appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If if there was a desire to dedicate the proceeds to, as you said, law enforcement or code enforcement or other services necessary, you may create it as a special tax, which would require a two thirds vote of the people in order to pass.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think you have to be very careful on how you allocate or where you would say you would dedicate it. Similar to Measure A, there was a resolution non-binding that was advisory on the council for that. Something like that could be done, but generally speaking, it would be a general tax come to the Council for allocation'",
        "'speaker_10': '. So the resolution, would that be something that could come to the council after tonight?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is correct. It could come at any time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So I would make a friendly amendment that we asked the city attorney to look at a resolution that would express the intent of the council to spend any tax revenues, to cost recovery for any operations associated with medical marijuana enforcement, which would probably be for the illegal operations, which I think are the biggest concern for all'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would so number one, I would say that I think there is a there is a conversation about, you know, from a legal standpoint, how to what are the implications of when we place this on the ballot and dedicated?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Does it require a higher threshold to be adopted or are there some steps that we can consider? So I think I think a good friendly should be to inquire if the city attorney can come back with options on, you know, what are the implications of one or the other.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because what I don't want to do is, you know, we're kind of under a deadline to make sure we meet the appropriate, you know, timeline for the to make place on the ballot. So if you're willing to make your friendly more broad come back show some options for how we can dedicated obviously I think the city council'",
        "'speaker_11': 'would support if there was a resolution about public safety, but there might be other things in place and we just need to broaden it a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure. Sure. And just to clarify, I mean, I know we're under the gun, which is why I had suggested we start discussing a competitive initiative a couple of weeks ago. But I understand we're under the gun and I'm not asking for a resolution or anything to come back at the next council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm just saying at some point in the future, so so we can word it as broadly as you like. Maybe we can say at some point after this item, the city attorney to come back with options on how the city council can basically declare their intent for how the tax money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So as long.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As they declare the. Sure, that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and as part of that city attorney, I think what Councilman Price is is is asking, is that a process that we put in place similar to Measure A where the council very clearly said where the intent was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But obviously, the you know, the measure itself was a general tax, but there was resolutions and there was other materials that were that were adopted that the council showed pretty clear intent about where the tax revenue would go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can do that for you. But it is my understanding that that resolution of that option won't come back on August 2nd. It'll be some time after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's perfect. Thank you. We're going to. Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just want to thank you for being here. Guys, can you hear me? Thank you, Vice Mayor, for bringing this option to us. I just want to stress that I would also want to have that conversation about where the money goes to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have one question for a city attorney. Can you clarify the county tax? Should that pass? Where would those funds go to where Long Beach have to apply or is it automatic?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I may ask the city manager to add in here. It's my understanding that these those funds will not automatically come to the city of Long Beach, that they will be dedicated special tax for homeless. And I believe that the city maybe there may be opportunities to apply for certain grants, but there is no guaranteed source of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'any revenue coming to Long Beach from the proposed county tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then I just want to stress I mean, I want to thank Tony Razor for her comments. I think looking at the state level around, you know, the lowest tax possible for medical is something that, you know, when we continue this conversation, looking at how many funds would come in, should we lower that amount to even'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a 4%, even though that that is something that's not in the original ballot measure? So I just wanted to make that comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. So we have a motion in a second on the floor to approve the motion by Councilman Richardson, as I stated with the friendly by Councilwoman Susie Price. Members, please go ahead and cast for votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much, counsel. We're going to go ahead and now move on to the next item, which is there's a request from Councilman Gonzales. What item would you like to hear? I'm sorry. That related to Harvey Milk Park, you said.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. And Arturo, is there a staff report to please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Members of the city council, Arturo Sanchez with the city manager's office. The item we have before you is per the council request, to return with a revised scope of work that is inclusive of the elements that were important to the Harvey Milk Park Committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staff has had several discussions with the committee and we developed, I believe, a scope of work that is reflective of maintaining a strong identity related to Harvey Milk, the legacy that he brings, as well as the memory wall in the wall recognizing civic leaders related to the LGBTQ community in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Great. And I just have a couple questions. Arturo, thank you very much for your work in this and working with the committee as well as my office to really create a better understanding of what the grant will comprise of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can you go over how many meetings you've had with the committee so far?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, ma'am. Through the chair to Councilmember Gonzalez, we have had three meetings, I believe, and several discussions via email with the leadership of the committee.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Great. And just an overview, if you could. I understand there will be an outdoor office space. Like what other key elements can you describe in this scope of work so people can really understand what this will become very soon?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, ma'am. In the attachment page one, under the opportunity to summarize the project towards the tail end of that description, if I could read a few sections from there it will say it is of paramount importance that Harvey Milk Promenade Park and Equality Plaza continue to serve as a memorial for Harvey Milk and other leaders in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'LGBTQ community. As more users are drawn to the outdoor office, more people can be exposed to the life and legacy of Harvey Milk. In this way, the message of the park is amplified beyond the existing memorial. It is the city's intention to consider reorienting the park, enhancing LGBTQ elements and or add a commemorative element of Harvey Milk'",
        "'speaker_5': 'so as to incorporate the message and meaning of the park into the added amenities in ways that are respectful, creative and inspiring amenities and or elements such as increasing redesigning the space for plaques of local LGBTQ, creating and designing a creative dynamic and visual representation of LGBTQ heroes at the Park and Equality Plaza.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Representation of the LGBT and Mr. Q their pride colors by creating and or designing a representation of pride colors that is artistically and visually impactful that transcends day and night. Creating and designing some imagery of Harvey Milk at the Park and Equality Plaza and potentially incorporating the history of Harvey Milk and history of local LGBT.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Next, another Q Movement. Finally, the programing of the park must intentionally and specifically include programing for LGBT communities and its allies. One of the important things to point out here is that, of course, it's a $300,000 grant and there will be decisions that will need to be made about how these elements are included.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the committee is committed to working with us. In fact, they've already designated three members to work closely with us on with the rest of the community stakeholders that will be pulling together now to really start the serious work on this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Great. Again, I really want to thank you very much for your work on this because I know it's so very important for the downtown community, the LGBTQ community. We have Vanessa, Deb and Raul that are here from the Harvey Milk Park Committee.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I also see Craig Cogen as well, who had been involved with so many things in downtown, of course, of being the CEO and thank you to city staff as well. I think this is going to be a impeccable project for including more local LGBTQ honorees, but also enlivening the life of Harvey Milk.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Are we at the second of that motion was with was Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just wanted to chime in and just say that I've been following this this project for a while now. In fact, I was you know, we're trying our best to emulate the outdoor office concept at Highland Park. But I just wanted to say that tremendous work has been done here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and I know that is sometimes difficult to pull together different interests and and make something happen. So this is really, really a good testament to your leadership. Council Member GONZALEZ So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I, too, want to express my support for this project. I think it's really great. The most impressive part of this process for me was staffs working with the community to get it right. So whatever the process was at the outset, I only read about it in the paper, but it wasn't ideal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the fact that everybody kind of came to the table and made the process right and made it something that the councilwoman is so happy with is really a great thing to witness. And obviously something that all of us with different projects in our in our districts can relate to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just making sure that that process is good so that the the project, if it's successful, is successful not just because of the end product, but because of the process, too. So this is great. I wish I wish I had an outdoor office to work in every day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think it's going to be a great asset to have. I did try to suggest it to some of the stuffy lawyers I work with and they laughed and said, Dream on. So I look forward to watching other people working in their outlets or outdoor offices as I drive to work.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I just wanted to say what a great job Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilwoman Gonzalez has done. And congratulations to the committee that's worked on this. One of the first times I spoke at council as a resident was supporting the creation of Harvey Milk Park based on everything that he's taught our community about courage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it's great to have this celebrate Harvey Milk, but also have it as an opportunity to invite others into that space that might not know who he is. And so I just want to congratulate everybody for really working together and hopefully it's a model for how we can work on future projects.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Larry, would you click as the address? I would request that this city take judicial notice. Of the staff report when this. Subject to change a little too. It came up the last council meeting of the meeting before when they pointed it out that Long Beach is the only the only the only city in this country.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To have a plaza named after Harvey Milk. Or the mayor of the of San Francisco. Related to that. The only reason we have this here is because of the despicable conduct of a photo addicted political pipsqueak that thought he could make political hay out of the unfortunate and tragic, tragic deaths of two individuals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By naming the park after a person who had no connection to this city whatsoever and in so doing, gave the middle finger. The Long Beach residents that were within that community. That does not speak well for the character of this city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it does what I'm saying does not eviscerate some of the comments some people have made here tonight. But the genesis of this. Is what needs to be. Worked out eradicated. It may have to be completely taken down and shipped back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's particularly devastating to the city's image when it comes with what's happening when combined with what's unfolded in the last three, six months. Pimping out. Teenagers. In an attempt to get a selfie with the first lady. And also in solving her.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By suggesting her character was such that she would like to come down, she would allow herself to be come down and be seen as elbowing her way into a situation where more people or local residents were more qualified.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To have a library named after a period. That's an insult to the first lady of the United States, all orchestrated in the final analysis by a political pipsqueak who will be by the end of the year, in prison.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I suggest you again take judicial notice of the fact and ask yourself why no other city in the country has it. It does not speak well for the character of any individual on this council. That does not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For coming back and redo it.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. When I. Now. Did some study on the Harvey Milk legend. I noted that he had fought for all minorities, not just the LGBT. Not just the. The. Same sex community and. Somewhere in there I thought, Oh, the homeless fit in there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So while we are closing out Linkin Park. And I've thought about this for a while. The homeless have nowhere to go. They don't have a park. So that's how Harvey Milk fought for all minorities, all people who were outcast.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He fought for the outcast. Is it feasible as we're closing out Lincoln Park for the redevelopment? To now say to the homeless community, here is a place where you, too, can gather. Outdoor office. What does that mean? Maybe there would be some people sitting out door in that office on staff who could.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Help facilitate the homeless who are part of the same sex community. Harvey Milk didn't just fight for the same sex community. He fought for those who were of the outcast IV service, those who were of the same sex transferring into another outward gender community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And when you're homeless and you're trying to go from a man to a woman or a woman to a man, it's much harder. But if that if if the park that Mr. Miller fought for embraces all of the outcasts, which includes the homeless.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we have the, the, the same sex community and the transferring into another outward appearance community embrace the homeless. You're bringing all of the outcasts together. Now we have to ask ourself. If the same sex community is looking down on the homeless, what really is going on here?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the only park we have is for the same sex or the transfering out of my God given gender into another outward appearance community. Then. Then we're having a park, but we're we're leaving another whole community out of the accommodation of the park that is named after the legend who fought for all of the outcasts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I need you to think about it. Where are the homeless community community going to go? When you get up Linkin Park. Abe Lincoln would probably want to know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really? Mayor Council City staff. First of all, congratulations to Councilmember Supernova De Andrews and Al Austin on the reelection and congratulations, Jeanine Pierce. It's especially nice to see you up there. Thank you very much for your continued support on this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was here about three weeks ago when the grant needed to be approved and the committee is has been committed to this project since the initial days in 2012 with then Councilmember Robert Garcia. And we continue to work with Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez and city staff.'",
