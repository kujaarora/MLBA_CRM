    "Budget Hearing for Parks, Recreation and Marine, Library Services, and Code Enforcement.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Members. Here this report from the city manager with the recommendation to conduct a budget hearing to receive and discuss an overview of the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Proposed fiscal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Year 2014 budget. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. West. You want me to you want me to get started? The return of you coming to go and start. So what? I know that the Council and the public have had a chance to review the budget as presented by the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a it's a budget that, in my opinion, has been well, well thought out. And a lot of the the the top management team, the financing put a lot of work into. I'm going to start by going through my recommendations as mayor for the 20,000 for the 2015 FBI budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As part of that. And when I go to this presentation, it's one that I made earlier. And in fact, a few of the council members were here earlier. From there, Mr. West will take it over and walk us through the budget itself and there'll be opportunities for any questions as well as public comment towards the end.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you should all have the recommendations in front of you that have being passed out and we're going to go out and go through those. I want to just start off by saying what I said this morning is that we have over the last few years gone through a very difficult financial time in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been a really in large part to a lot of the work and the returning council members that have been here that have been able to get the get the budget back into a strong position, we've been able to eliminate a lot of that structural deficit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've been able to go and work with our city employees to reform our public pension system. So we're in a position today where we have a small surplus, and I think rightly so. Management has proposed that surplus move forward so we can look forward, look for savings in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to reiterate some key messages that Mayor Foster left on the way out. I think it's important that moving forward, we continue our partnership with all of our employee groups. The only way we solve our future budget challenges is by working with our employee groups, by working with management to ensure that we are providing the best'",
        "'speaker_1': 'possible service to our employees, while also looking at the financial future of the city. So that that is going to continue. And the budget message reflects that, although the items that Mayor Foster suggested are items that like in any case, in any budget cycle, will always be on the table and we'll review those thoroughly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also, as part of the budget message, I want to reiterate my support for benchmarking oil at $70 a barrel as we know oil. Is still a pretty volatile commodity. And I think we've learned our lessons from the past and the fluctuation of the oil price certainly caused the city some financial strain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but more importantly, the way we value oil also has a direct relationship to our bond rating and our credit rating. And our bond rating is incredibly important for the city. And so keeping that responsible level of the $70 a barrel is something that I continue to support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as part of this message moving forward, however, it made some additional budget recommendations. Most are budget neutral. And in fact, it's really about restructuring the way we we do business and engineering a lot of what the council incoming council has been talking about for the last few months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The first proposal is to continue to strengthen our reserves. The manager's budget allocates 3.1 million of F 15 surplus into the CalPERS stabilization fund. And as we know, that's going to help us smooth out our deficit challenges in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I propose, in addition to that, we take two mil, 2 million, up to 2 million of any FY14 surplus, and we will have a surplus like we do most years and also put that into the CalPERS stabilization fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By doing that, we are ensuring that we're taking care of our future challenges today rather than pushing them forward, and that will allow future years to have it really be in a more stronger position when it comes financially.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So one is to strengthen those those CalPERS Stabilization Reserve by an additional 2 million, up to 2 million, depending on what we have. The second thing is I'm proposing that we look at restructuring the way we organize economic development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is something that I heard also pretty loud and clearly from almost all of the council members that the new council that's here is their interest in returning and having an economic development department within the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm proposing and reorganizing. We currently have already in place an economic development and property manager within the city manager's office. What this will do is part of the budget is also bring over seven staff from the asset management division of our public works to to form the new the new department, which will be economic and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'property development. There is no additional cost. We're essentially bringing staff members from different parts of the city together to restart this department for Long Beach. One key component of this is the new department will work directly with city council offices and business improvement districts to create synergy among the initiatives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's important that the Council have a point person in this office, as well as a director of this department that is willing to work directly with council offices as they do business recruitment and work with the community and the business improvement district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's the second part of my proposal. The third is to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Restructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our technology services department. We have a great group in technology services that do a lot of a lot of fantastic work and have implemented a lot of changes over the last few years. But I like to restructure and rename the department, the Technology and Innovation Department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in doing so, not only will I would like to instruct the manager to look at the department for ways of really bringing innovation into the department, partnering with the university, partnering with the community college, and looking at ways that we can take our government into the 21st century.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm a firm believer that innovative technology with open government, with making our services more accessible, we can create a stronger city, one that works for people, that creates efficiency, but also supports the men and women that are working there currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that also is no addition. No, there's no cost to the general fund, but it will really shift a little bit of the focus, and that department will become a real center for innovation. The next proposal is, again, something I heard from a lot of the current council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During the recession. We lost a historic preservation officer who essentially, as we know, we have 17 designated historic districts throughout the city of Long Beach. They're in every part of the city. They're incredibly important. And we have lost the the person, the position that essentially helped facilitate historic preservation with the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And while we've done some great work, part of my budget recommendations is to reclassify a planner three position that's already in the proposed budget and designate them as the role of historic preservation planner. To serve all these historic districts and to have one highly dedicated staff planner be able to help manage all the really great needs that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our historic districts have. And so this is something that, again, I heard from the community, I heard from council members, and I think it's important to move forward on next is additional support for libraries and the arts, our libraries and the way and the type.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Some materials they have are changing. I've asked that we added this an additional $200,000 of one time funds to increase the materials budget for the library. I included in that would be also a focus on digital books and digital media as the types of use is changing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're getting more interest in ebooks and media and so we're this will also help the library adapt and add to some of those needs that they need. We've also asked that we'd give an additional 50,000 to the Arts Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a request that they made. In fact, I think they probably sent letters to to all of us up here to allow them to do some new marketing and to look for other private funds to match those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The 250,000 total for libraries and the arts. I'm recommending that we take out of a a line item for each VAC systems. In talking to the manager. The we aren't yet ready to replace those systems and so we have some time to replace a couple of those HVAC systems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we're able to use this money and still have no issues and then come back later this year or next year and replace those, those systems that we need that need replacing. And then the last two items I know that over the last few years, we have had, particularly last year, a discussion here at the council'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about privatizing our street sweeping. And the manager went out and did a study and looked at efficiencies in the street sweeping operation. My recommendation is that we that we table and shelve the street sweeping contracting our proposal and that we instead look to our street sweepers and our program that we have currently and ask them to look'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for efficiencies and ask them to look at ways of strengthening our street sweeping function. It's my belief that just because something is less expensive doesn't mean it's better. And this is a way of looking at our street sweepers that we currently have and allowing them to bring some solutions to the table as far as street sweeping is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'concerned. As part of that, we're asking to look to for to look to reduce the four hour window to 2 hours, particularly in parking impacted neighborhoods for the community and other efficiencies that are available. And finally, I want to just a few things about affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As we know, the game has changed when it comes to funding for affordable housing because of the elimination of redevelopment. And there's a bunch of things happening currently in the legislature when it comes to funding affordable housing. The current budget has presented a is pretty tight as we know, but we need to start having a discussion about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how we do affordable housing moving forward. And so what I propose in the budget is a way of starting that discussion. We've had a housing trust fund for many years. As we know. We expect to get back about 24.7 $25 million from the state over the next few years for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As part of this proposal is to take that 25 million and put it into the housing trust fund so that we can then begin to look at ways of actually building and working on our affordable housing challenge. But in addition to that, as part of the budget message, I'm asking ways of reaching out to the community and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'housing advocates to see how can we strengthen the housing trust fund now that it will actually have money for the first time since it was created and also look at ways of other funds as we come down the pipeline and as is available in the future and in future budgets, how we how we end up funding affordable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'housing is a discussion that we need to have throughout this budget process. So I know that was a little lengthy, but I wanted to make sure I got through all those recommendations. Those are as presented. And I'm hearing this over to the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia. Thank you. Councilmembers. I do want to highlight that we prefer to take the capital improvement budget at the conclusion of this. So we have discussion first and then get into the capital improvement because it's so separate from our operating budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have the pleasure of introducing our fiscal year 14 budget to the community. And let's just highlight some of the things that have happened. Our Mayor and his city council have steered Long Beach through the Great Recession.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This council has made difficult cuts and balanced past budgets. We've cut $134 million out of the general fund and 714 positions. Over the last eight years. We've invested in maintenance, efficiency and effectiveness. We've established and we followed those established financial policies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've also used 14 temporary surplus fiscal year, 14 temporary surplus dollars to reduce or eliminate deficits as we proceed into the future. We've also addressed pensions. Our pension reform in conjunction with our employees saves almost $250 million over ten years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also want to point out that the CalPERS board actions will ensure that this plan is funded over 30 years. You'll see later in this budget this is going to be a very, very difficult time for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is extremely necessary so we can pay down that unfunded liability with the help of peers. We've also created a CalPERS stabilization fund. This will help protect against service reductions due to fluctuating CalPERS investments and earnings. There's also been many operational and efficiency improvements recently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've reduced the general fund management team by 28%. We've eliminated hundreds of vehicles from the city fleet. We've consolidated clerical staffing. We've streamlined permit fees and consolidated inspection services. We've even eliminated two entire departments, and we're implementing a more efficient ambulance service as we speak.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've also implemented what we call Long Beach Cops. This leverages technology to fight crime. This is under the leadership of Chief Jim McDonald and provides a camera system that is in our emergency operations center that oversees much of our 52 square miles to fight crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've also reduced skill and stand by pace throughout all of our nine employee organizations. We're also in the process of implementing new systems that will take us into the 21st century. We've introduced a brand new parking citation system which will improve improved collection rates.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to make it clear that this system is not about issuing more tickets. It's about going after scofflaws who have not paid their tickets. We're in the process of implementing a brand new business license system, which will make it easier for the public and our business folk to get business licenses and improve the way that they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do business. We've also implemented a brand new utility billing system that's been very, very successful throughout the community. And finally, one of the things that this city council has talked about for the past four years, we've implemented a brand new financial and our system, which is underway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We funded that. That's going to take another year and a half or two to put online. But it's a huge undertaking and will take us into the 21st century with technology and computer efforts. We wanted to focus a little bit about the fiscal year 14 accomplishments that have happened just recently and throughout the past few years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are experiencing a 41 year low in violent crime throughout our community. Chief McDonnell tells us we're continuing to see violent crime drop even this year. We're also seeing major projects completed or underway. These include the brand new Molina health care buildings, a Fortune 500 company expanding their on Pine and Seventh Street, bringing over 1000 well-paid jobs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to North Pine. Mercedes-Benz is building a brand new facility there at the old 717 site, and Douglas and Canaan, and they're in the middle of that construction period. And that will be a game changer for us. If anyone's driven by Douglas Park, which is north of the airport at the old Boeing property, this is becoming a grand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'slam home run, run for us. It's rivaling the Irvine spectrum property in Irvine as an industrial and office facility. More and more buildings are going up every month. It's just fantastic. The park continues to be a great partner and leader in all of our economic activities with the Middle Harbor as well as the bridge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Numerous restaurants have opened up in the past year. We're getting to be quite the location for this. We've got Chia Nina. We've got the Socialist Retro Row Bobo's on Pine, James Republic, the Federal Bar. And more and more restaurants are expanding and relocating like E.J. Malloy's and Hamburger Mary's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Pike retail component is ready to take off. We hope within the next year the park is moving to be a quality outlet facility there and adjacent to the convention center. And it's anchored by the Restoration Hardware Outlet Store, which we're told is the most successful restoration hardware outlet store in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We continue to get awards for things like the downtown plan and our mobility element. We just learned recently, while we knew we had a county award in the mobility element, the state of California has issued us their chief award for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our Parks and Recreation Department continues to win awards, getting a golden medal for the best Parks and Recreation Department in the entire United States this year. When we had to close the old Thelma pool, the city council acted so quickly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had a brand new temporary pool open within just a ten month period, which was unheard of. After many years, the City Council adopted a new billboard ordinance, and this will go a long way in reducing illegal or grandfathered billboards on our corridors throughout our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And finally, through the City Council's efforts and their own council committees, we are now receiving A and B grades for water quality. And all of our bodies of waters were once we just got D's and F's. So let's get into the budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our first core is to preserve services police, fire, public works, libraries, parks and all major services are preserved in this proposed budget. We're using proportionate share again, and that keeps budgets aligned with council priorities and incentivizes departments to be efficient.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you can see about 50% of our general fund goes to our police department. Approximately 19 or 20% goes to fire. And then the rest is divided among various various sources. Our focus continues to be on public safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': '70% of our general fund budget is devoted to public safety. We continue to have police and fire academies funded for this current year going forward. We're also adding police officers for Long Beach Transit and firefighters at the port.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This budget also includes $2.2 million for enhanced overtime for gang prevention and other efforts and our Long Beach Police Department. We are also investing in police technology and also adding a brand new police station at East Station there at Willow and Lakewood Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that should break ground shortly at the old Schroeder Hall and get our men and women out of that old, decrepit East police station there at the traffic circle. We're also using GMT money, state revenues for for new fire engines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have to point out, if you look in the budget, we have five engines. But the council recently allocated some of the money for one of the engines to sidewalks for infrastructure. So they'll go to four. We also are going to fund our prior year commitments in the past when we would build a park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sometimes we wouldn't provide parks and rec the money to maintain that park, and they would have to just divide up their expenditures to do that. This year, we're changing that. We're providing Parks Rec and Marine $287,000 for park maintenance and new parks like the expanded Shattuck Field.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're also adding $109,000 for a position to oversee things that are important to the Council for their policies. Language Access Plan, Violence Prevention Plan, Long Beach Grip and the Human Dignity Program will also provide $49,000 for a position to help improve our homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As we prepare for the future, we also have some one time dollars available, about $11 million. And here's how we plan to spend that. Basically, we're investing in future efficiency improvements. We're investing in $2.45 million for park irrigation upgrades and water needs, as well as $1.37 million for artificial turf version.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we'll get a fourth artificial turf soccer field to match the three that were funded last year. This alone will save millions of gallons of water every year for Parks Rec and Marine. We're also setting aside $800,000 to purchase and install smart parking meters in Belmont Shore in the downtown, as well as $1.3 million in state air'",
        "'speaker_1': 'quality funds for fuel efficient vehicles and anti idling technology, which will save lots of fuel for us. We're also having a huge focus on critical infrastructure while the budget has $4.9 million in our residential street program. We're adding $1 million of one time dollars to match this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'While our normal budget in the capital budget has $3 million for sidewalks, we're recommending another million dollars or one times to match that. We're also setting aside $2.1 million to guarantee that the library looks like I'm going to have them close the inner thing as we're testing out these new curtains here because it's a little sunny.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this won't close the whole thing. But it's just the. Actually, there's a there's an inner one, I think, from what they told me earlier. All right. There we go. Now it's so dark. Thank you. I was on the $2.1 million to make the North Library.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All I can be are. But our bids came in for the North Library on target, and we're in great shape. But we want to guarantee that we can do the offsite and put all the fixtures and equipment in the new North Library that will get started shortly, as well as $400,000 for other critical equipment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've done a lot of efficiencies and reorganizations. Our Long Beach Police Department is reorganizing to add 18 sworn police officers to the front line in police services to meet the needs out there on the streets. Development Services is restructuring their permit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Counter Public Works is reviewing project management and organization structures. Our health department is increasing grant funded positions to maximize money. Our Parks and Recreation Marine is reorganizing the Animal Care Bureau for more efficiency and oversight. We continue to fund our future commitments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Council authorized or recommended 5% of non-recurring revenue for unfunded liabilities, and that is in here. And we're also recommending to transfer $3.1 million of temporary surplus to the CalPERS stabilization fund, which will protect us in the future from market fluctuations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are challenges coming. City revenues are not sufficient to sustain service increases. We know that fiscal year 15 and fiscal year 16 are transition years. We know that expenses have been and are likely to continue to outpace revenues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Revenues excluding one time events have declined in the last five years. There's been negative basic growth. Our key personnel expenses category has increased an average between one and 7% over the last five years. So as we look for fiscal year 15 and fiscal year 16, it looks like we are going to have two years of what we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'call budget peace. But here's where I get to my winter is coming. Slide. Here's the CalPERS rate increases that is going to take care of our unfunded liabilities. As you can see, 15 in the blue area is the $41 million that we pay annually to pers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'PERS is going to increase to smooth out the unfunded liabilities. And as people are living longer, they have to put more money into that as well. So in 17, we're going to see what we're predicting as a $13 million deficit in 18.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're looking at a $20 million deficit, and these are cumulative. In 1926, 20, a $33 million deficit, and in 21, a $35.6 million deficit. Now, after 21, we'll see that start to decline slightly, but 21 will be our big year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, winter is coming. We have other challenges. We have expiring employee agreements that we'll be taking up shortly. Our employee benefit costs continue to outpace inflation. We have unfunded liabilities, as we saw on Cal's a CalPERS pension that's going to be taken care of through the CalPERS payments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we still have unfunded liabilities and sick leave, retiree health care subsidies and workers comp. Mr. West I also want to just make sure that that we know that, because I think it's an important point. If you look at that CalPERS chart on page 15 that Mr. West just went through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's important to note that the the deficit that we're going to accrue is in direct relation, has a direct relationship to our payment that's going out to CalPERS. And so what we're essentially doing over the next few years is we're paying off what we really should have been paying off many, many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it isn't it's a deficit that we are that's been created because of our increased payment into the system. So the payment into the system is a really good thing because we need to obviously deal with our with our liabilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as you look at at those at those deficits in the future, those deficits, while certainly are are painful, and they will be over the next few years as they smooth out. We're going to be doing great damage to that to that pot of money that we owe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that is the really positive thing out of this, is that we're actually taking care of those payments through this new model with the staff level in the finance department. Couldn't agree more. As you pointed out earlier, it's going to be difficult, but very, very necessary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we totally agree. We know that we're facing a $2 million. We're facing a deficit of $2.5 million in 16 and 8.5 and 17. This proposed budget applies $3.1 million of our fiscal year temporary surplus to help solve 16 and 17.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if we carry that surplus forward, we look for a zero deficit in 15. A zero deficit and 16. And a reduced deficit in 17. So the plan for success is to maintain our current services through proportionate share.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This budget doesn't decrease any services. There are no new services without offsetting reductions. The police and fire academies provide for new police officers and firefighters. The budget continues to develop efficiencies and explore cost reductions. Are one time expenditures focus on reducing operating car calls costs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're adding to our CalPERS stabilization fund and carry over temporary surplus moneys to address future deficits. And there's an additional funding for unfunded liabilities for the 5% council policy. This maintains a strong city services for our very diverse and vibrant community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It continues investment in city infrastructure. It maintains fiscal discipline and continues to develop efficiencies and explore cost reductions. We continue to maximize existing revenue and continue to look for new revenues and maintain our Long Beach fiscal health. So here's the budget timeline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here's how we got to today. Beginning in March, the budget outlook was presented to the city council. On March 12th, we had instructions to the to the departments. In July, we started to submit all of the proposed budget to the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'July 3rd, July 9th, Mayor Foster submitted the proposed budget to the city council. And tonight we have Mayor Garcia submitting his recommendations on the budget. Let's take a quick peek at the budget timeline, and this is where we'll need input from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The City Council. While all of August will be devoted to community budget meetings, whether they're at in different districts or they're at various organizations, the mayor requests them during August. We're also expecting to have budget oversight committees with the new Budget Oversight Committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the next council, the next council meeting, we will have a budget hearing. We'll have budget hearings and all of our council meetings until we adopt the budget. So the next one we're recommending to begin with our public safety continuum.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'August 5th, we will start with public safety related items like code enforcement, parks and Rec, Marine and Library. On August 12th, we'll see public safety items like police and fire to continue that public safety continuum. August 19th will recommend public works, harbor and water.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'September 2nd, we stand prepared to have other departments as well, and that's the first opportunity for the council to adopt anything. And if you have any recommendations or requests for us, we certainly could alter these upcoming public hearings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we could also add second meetings, of course, like one at 4:00 or 5:00 in another, one at a time certain at 7:00. So before I conclude, I do want to thank our department heads have worked so hard to put this budget and others together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank our finance director, John GROSS, the budget manager, Lia Erickson, Joe Martin, Tom Modica, Jeff Hall. And I mostly want to thank Suzanne Frick, who is going through her seventh and last budget with us. Her 250th city council meeting and next Friday will be her last day before she heads up to Idaho.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much. And we'd be happy to respond to any questions. But again, Mr. West, did you want to perhaps go through a capital improvement budget now and then? Any questions? We'd prefer to say that because it's so different than the average.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. Well, at this time, are there any questions from any council members REC and Councilmember O'Donnell? Just quick question with regard to the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe is $24 million cited coming back to the city had to do with redevelopment? Was that a $24 million figure?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Some time ago, the state this goes into the the education augmentation fund. So we paid that once sometime ago. And then the state asked the agency to pay more money and a supplemental education reimbursement. It's called the CRF.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the agency to pay that needed to borrow the money from our low mod 20% housing fund. So we did that. And now as money is coming back to the city in the demise of the agency, that money has to come back and be paid to our 20% set aside fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's something we knew is happening and it's coming back to repay the loan to the state of California for from our Longmont set aside fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that is you answer my question which is that money is locally dedicated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Typically dedicated to affordable low very and low affordable housing. It can't go to moderate our workforce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I mean, you know, Pat, I'd like to ask a question. You know, on Slide ten, what projects are going to be covered with the park irrigation upgrade and the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Artificial turf.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The new irrigation system will cover Hartwell Park that's been identified as the one needing the most work and then the artificial turf field. We were hoping to get ADM Kid Park last year, but we just couldn't get the funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this will ramp up. ADM Kid Park for us. Thank you. Councilmember Gringo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On page 18, you have the police and fire academies to provide the new police officers, firefighters. Do you have an estimate as to what we're looking at for new hires?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm I'm going to turn that over to John.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the both the fire and police academies will be based on attrition, and we'll be making those decisions later. We think the fire academy will be pretty close to the maximum size we can handle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cotton blossom.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. City Manager, let me first of all commend you and the entire city staff, the administrative staff, for putting together this this, I think, very responsible budget thus far. I'm certainly looking forward to haggling over it a bit with my council colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I support the the prefunding strategy to deal with the unfunded liabilities. I think that's very responsible. But I did have a couple of questions. I mean, I have a few questions, and I'll most of them will probably be answered as we would deal with department specific budgets in the weeks to come.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there was a couple of things that jumped out to me. On the $2.2 million in enhanced overtime for gang prevention and other efforts. Do you can you elaborate a little bit on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those dollars, that $2.2 million, this will go for overtime activities in the police department. We usually provide this every year out of the one times. This will be strictly under the the the observation of Chief McDonald and his team on where to put those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the past they've heard a lot of talk from the Council on the Community about frontline gangs teams and that's what they're preparing to use that for. But as I said, this will be at the discretion of the chief of police.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. And then regarding from funds for prior year commitments, the 280,000 $87,000 for park maintenance for new and expanded parks. Is this for park maintenance? These one time one time maintenance?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is this is excuse me, councilmember and mayor. This is structural money that will go to pay to and to take care of the extra added open space that we've put in, say, to the field. This will guarantee that we structurally can maintain the airfield and water it and any of the new parks that we've expanded or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'added.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we have any other parks that we would apply this money to?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, absolutely. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the the the 1.3 million for artificial turf conversion, that only one soccer field.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that's one soccer field. It's much more expensive than we thought it was going to be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And where exactly is that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That will go to Admiral Kidd Park. And that was a park that was on the list last year. But we can only do three instead of four. So we're keeping our commitment to get to Admiral Kidd Park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I also wanted to ask a few questions and and my compliments to the city management staff as well for the start. I am not aware you may have shown this on a slide, but do you have a schedule for the department specific presentations you did?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, we did. And again, we're looking for input on that. These are just our recommendations. So August 5th, public safety items like code enforcement, parks and Rec, Marine and Library, August 12th. Public safety items. Police and fire and the 19th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Public Works Harbor and Water. But as I said, we're looking for input and direction from the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in terms of how much time we have allocated historically, I don't think we've spent a lot of time necessarily to go over area by area, for instance, public safety for violent crime statistics. And so what I think we'll find from our individual council areas or neighborhood associations, I see one of mine in the audience right now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that while citywide we have a 41 year low for violent crimes, we're going to hear hotspots. We're going to talk about hotspots. I have one of my commanders here as well. And so in the allocation of the $2.2 million for enhanced overtime for gang prevention and other efforts, as it's stated, can we anticipate more detail from the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'chief of police as to how that would be allocated? Not necessarily calling out particular areas and tipping off exactly where our focus would be, but to provide some assurance to neighborhoods that are really struggling, that aren't quite feeling this prosperity of the 41 year all time low.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Vice Mayor Yes, we certainly we want to see that. And I think I feel much better having the chief of police respond to those than myself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But will that be an instruction to your department head to do that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely, yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That I wasn't clear about my question, but that's what I was looking for. And then on page nine for homeless services, the halftime position. I think the question was asked, but more specifically, would it be to improve the services in the field or administrative services or at the multi-purpose or multi-service center?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to turn that over to Leah or John.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Specifically, it's in the home, is in the center. However, the administrative duties that it performs will free up the equivalent of time in the field. So people who are currently now in the field and doing administrative duties can spend more time in the field.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So do we have a situation where the folks that are in the field spend a considerable amount of administrative time? That is correct. Okay. And all right. So we should see a like for like our for our replacement of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So ostensibly, that could translate to halftime in the field. Okay. And then page ten, we have the park irrigation upgrades. I know Long Beach Water and I and others have been working for a long time to get our irrigation systems upgraded so that we aren't manually hand cranking certain medians.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is this the type of upgrades that we're talking about so that we will be on a central command center type operation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. This will be 21st century irrigation systems. And then when Parks and Rec Marine presents, Mr. Chapman can go into his other things that you've been working on with you for the past couple of years with MWD and our water department.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And finally, for now, just a compliment to the $800,000 to purchase the smart meters. Those of us who have 100% parking impacted neighborhoods have been working on this for quite some time. I want to recognize Dave Roseman, whom I don't know if he's in the audience, but he made a trip all the way to the other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'end of the coast to Santa monica and and learn about how parking meters have increased revenues to about $100,000 a month in Santa monica, just by installing the sensors and the smart meters. So I want to thank the staff for making that field trip and doing their research.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Got some advice?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Special thanks to the city staff for preparing this budget for us. I did have a question about the one time revenues here, the $11.7 million. It appears from looking at this list that there is no discretionary money set aside in there for the districts to use on their needs in their community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having said that, I also note from the mayor's proposal that at least one of these anticipated costs is not quite ready for the expense, and that would be the emergency communications. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember, in looking at this, is the $400,000 that is set aside for operational needs. These are for some versus HPC systems, systems in some of our facilities. As you know, we've put together we started this budget about four months ago and putting it together and we put in the systems and as we got closer and closer to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'having public works, somebody analyzing them, we have some of the systems that actually do have some useful life on them. So this would come out of the VA system, HVAC system centers, so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That 300,000 is going to be allocated and is ready to be spent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there any other expenditure that's identified here that is maybe not ripe? For for us to spend money on quite yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, I haven't. I couldn't say yes to that. But again, all of this budget is at the discretion of the city council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to also, just in addition to Councilmember Price, the one one of the one time discretionary that's in there that was the city manager proposal was to on top of what we're putting in for infrastructure and capital improvements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe he also put maybe I think it was 2 million additional to that capital improvement. So it's at the discretion of the council if that in the past has been used to infrastructure in the past. Former councilors have also used that for projects within districts, smaller infrastructure projects for park projects as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr.. We may ask for clarification of Councilmember Price's question on the H. Vasey upgrade. So under your recommendations, your set of recommendations, I believe the fifth one was for Library and Arts Council, and it was a redirect of an HPC system funding that wasn't quite ready.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that's what I understood some. Mr. West that to 50 from HPC that is different is that different from the 300 that's on page seven of the community booklet. For Emergency Communications and HPC upgrade.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'd be able to handle most of the stuff in the EOC system, but was also allocated. Some of the money was allocated for other field HVAC systems. So that aren't ready at this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That are not ready.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. But the rest of the money is going to be allocated. Definitely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what you've identified here is ready to go? Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Consumer prices driven into questions or no?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Chancellor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So I want to begin by acknowledging this budget. I so you just referred to it as as a couple of years of budget piece. As chief of staff, I guess I was in a place of budget war.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's what Council Member Neal dealt with. So I'm happy this is our first budget. So good. Good work. A couple of things. I just want to note some steps in the right direction, but a few things I have some questions on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the the funding of the language access position is definitely most certainly a step in the right direction. I think the commitment that's being proposed to the North Library to make that project whole, that is certainly a step in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a long story there. But the fact that, you know, due to state action and loss of redevelopment and so on and so forth, many very important projects that we'd like to fund and we've taken steps in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We haven't been able to see them to completion, so I'm happy that we can finally do that. So thanks. Thanks. On that, I think the the fact that the health department is increasing grant funded positions, I think that's that's that's a step in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the budget stabilization fund is a huge step in the right direction. However, I want some clarity on that. So is this 3.1 million, which is the one time that we didn't spend last year? Is that money?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we've got that that we're going to place into this budget stabilization fund. Is this the first allocation to the budget stabilization fund?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to give that to Lia.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Richardson. So the there's 3.4 or 5 million from the 514 adopted budget that will be deposited in the stabilization fund at the end of this year. And then in the 15 proposed budget, there's an additional 3.1 million in the temporary surplus from 15 that would be deposited into the stabilization fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then based on Mayor Garcia's recommendations in the year end of 14, an additional 2 million, if realized, would be also deposited into the stabilization fund. So all told, totaled it would be about eight and a half million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I certainly support the budget stabilization fund. I think it makes a lot of sense if we want to continue to have budget peace. But at the same time, I'd like for us to plan how large we want this fund to be so that we can make plans to allocate one times strategically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they're not competing with other priorities, like the North Branch Library, like the one time funds. Councilmember Price mentioned, like the Highland Park Community Center that we took steps to fund in the last budget, we funded $3 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in this budget, as you can see, there's there's nothing allocated there. And in one budget we're making in one fell swoop, we're going to make an appropriation to two sounds like eight and a half million dollars to one fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that I absolutely agree that this is a step in the right direction. But we need to make sure that we make sense on how we do it and build that fund so that we're not damaging other projects that, like the library, haven't seen the complete funding to see to completion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Secondly, I don't know if this is the appropriate place to talk about this stuff, but I just want to acknowledge the mayor on some of the things in his recommendations. I thought they were they were pretty awesome. Just to name a couple of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I talked about the stabilization fund. I think the the the Economic Development Property Property Development Bureau or the department. It's a great idea. It can add some. We struggled the last few years to build the uptown bid. And I see these folks here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll talk to them later. But we struggled the last few years to see that. And the fact that we'll have a department is focused on helping to support that, I think is really telling our businesses and and all of our sort of economic development partners that we're struggling since the last redevelopment, that we're going to be a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'partner with them. It's not just council officers and chiefs of staff figuring it out on their own. So thank you for that. The fact that you're investing in libraries, I think is a great step. I'm going to support that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the most impressive thing is, is asking that the council and city manager remove street sweeping. I think that's a great gesture to our city employees, especially considering that we're going to have to go into bargaining with them very soon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's a good step in the right direction. So I did want to acknowledge that I don't know if the timing was appropriate, but since I got to make them and talk about it lastly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's always.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Appropriate. It's all good. It's all good. Lastly, Councilmember Price, that I'd love to talk with you about how I've seen how the council in the past is unrestricted, some of the sidewalk and the street dollars too. So council members have more discretion on how that spent as long as it's maintained an infrastructure, just like the mayor and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the vice mayor mentioned. So I'd love to talk with you offline or maybe in public. I guess that's how it works. Works now. I love to explore heading in that direction because we've done creative things in North Long Beach with that funding to improve our infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember O'Donnell. Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. City management staff. This is, you know, really great. I appreciate it. And it hits on all of the first District kind of issues. Homelessness, of course, parking. So thank you. I did have a question, though, on on page 12.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It just said briefly about restructuring the permitting counter for improve customer service. Were there any details that we can include in that? But Councilwoman Gonzales, by what they're going to be doing is converting some positions to two and I won't forget the title, but two professional level positions so that they're able to to provide better service.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there is an actual addition of four positions at the permit counter. And those will be offset though by, by cuts elsewhere in the department to be FTE neutral. So it will be basically additional staffing and a professional level position.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'll look up the title and get back to you in a second. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any additional questions?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council Member No, no, thank you. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See that there's those are all the council questions. What I'm going to do, Mr. West, is have you do Skype and then we'll open it up for public comment. Thank you. Mayor Councilmembers I'm going to turn it over to our public works director, our morning who's going to walk us through the our capital project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're going to look at some of the projects that have just been completed. We're going to look at the projects that the council has already approved but have not yet broken grounds. You'll see those on a bullet list.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we're going to look at the projects that are in the fiscal year 15 budget that the council needs to approve. Your basic duty tonight for this is to out to review it and give us direction. But obviously it needs to go to the planning commission and the commission needs to find it in conformance with the'",

We have construct bus stop improvement at various locations, perform bridge deck repairs listed in the County of Los Angeles Condition Survey Data January 2012 Reconstruct and resurface city streets to extend their useful life.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Provide incidental curb, gutter and sidewalk improvements, construct curb ramps and bus paths, and replace pavement markings in the residential streets we propose to repair through pavement, sealing asphalt overlays and full reconstruction repair works also to include replacement of damaged curbs, gutters, driveway approaches, installation of access ramps and replacement of signage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also propose to construct construct sidewalk improvements associated with a backlog of neighborhood infrastructure needs and construct verified requests for right of way access and improvements and investigate new request when received. This is our ADA program. Part of our transportation enhancement design construct.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Main Pipeline Replacement and service pipeline replacements. In conclusion, this was a summary of our current and proposed capital improvement programs for FY 15, which is intended to provide some order of magnitude of work proposed for the Engineering Bureau of Public Works Department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This workload is pretty aggressive, but our staff are up to the task and committed to project delivery on time and on budget. As to specific details. Stand by. I stand ready to answer your questions. This concludes my report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. I'm going to start off with Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Ira. Or Mr. Malloy. And I don't know what's supposed to say up here now. So, okay, so the CFP budget I think is great work in terms of the streets and see that we have Myrtle Avenue and Artesia Boulevard, which are major priorities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those are funded projects. I think that's great. What I wanted to discuss briefly in and request. Well, I guess what I want to discuss is the status of certain unfunded projects. Now, when I say unfunded projects, I'm not talking about the hundreds of millions of dollars of projects that department and council members have come up with over'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the last who knows how many years. I'm not talking about that humongous list of CIP projects. I'm talking about projects that perhaps in the wake of redevelopment, they maybe have certain steps have been taken in that direction to fund those projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But due to state action, they're not funded anymore. So we're talking about things like the medians on Artesia, where funding was allocated in the bonds, and because there wasn't ongoing funding to match that as it was anticipated when the bonds were when the bond funding was established, that project was eliminated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like the way that we're scrounging together money to finish the library because we own the bonds, we budget it $8 million, but it's upwards of a $14 million library like the Hilton Park Community Center that ten years ago there was a study.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just last year, we allocated 3 million for it. This year, there's nothing. Now, the last thing I want to do is say, give me a list that's not realistic of hundreds of millions of dollars, things that can't be funded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if there are lists of projects that I've just described, I'd like to see if we can make a plan to complete those projects, whether through this CIP process or we figure out other, other ways to work with council members to come up with a plan to finally put these things to rest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'During the campaign trail, I heard a bunch of folks talking about these projects, these mystical projects that we've talked about for years, but we don't have real plans for. And I'd like to, through this GOP process, finally, hopefully not in the next four years, but maybe this year, figure out how to narrow down what those projects are'",
        "'speaker_2': ', projects that have some portion of funding or some sort of work that's already had in that direction. So we can carve those out away from the massive list of CIP, other city projects that we have. So, so I guess that's my comment and my request.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So do you think a list like that can be pulled together? Mr. De Magic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think we could do that without a lot of discussion from the city council. Basically, we do have, as you pointed out, Councilmember, some of the projects that were were funded by the agency. But because of interest rates and things like that, they fell off the radar screen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One would be Artesia, of course. But if a project's not in the capital improvement list that you saw tonight, it is not funded. So in order to do that, you would have to bring it to us and provide a funding source or talk to us about a funding source.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, as I mentioned earlier, the city council has the wherewithal to change any of the funding sources here that you see tonight. So if you wanted to reallocate and take a project off the list and put a project on the list, we certainly could talk about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But as you and I talked today, we certainly have hundreds of millions of dollars of unfunded projects sitting before us. You're looking at the projects that the agency couldn't fund at the end that were funded by the agencies but fell off, which are small.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly that would be the library which we are fixing, and it would be Artesia, which does not have funding. Oregon Park would be one as well. But aside from Oregon Park and Artesia, I don't recall any other agency project that fell off, that was funded, that fell off the list.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There certainly were hundreds of millions of dollars of agency projects that were discussed but not funded, hoping that the agency would go on for another ten or 15 years. But as I said, we stand ready if the city council wants to reallocate any of the projects that they see before you tonight, especially the ones in the ones'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in 15, because the ones in 14 have already been funded. We certainly could work with you to reallocate those or if you wanted to set priorities as future money comes forward in the next several years. Those could be priorities for us as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's the direction that that I'm headed. If there's and again, I'm not talking about those massive list of projects, but they're projects that work had been done. Funding had been allocated. What is this list? Right. There could be a short list, but I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I haven't been here the whole time of redevelopment. What are these projects?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think there's two. It'd be Artesia and Oregon Park. Those are the only two sources that we had. Funds that disappeared. All the other. We don't have any. We don't have any projects that are on the list that got defunded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It wouldn't be on the list unless it had funding. And once it has funding, that it doesn't get. Defunded it unless the council defunds it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So have we developed a strategy to fund those two projects?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a strategy on Oregon Park that we've working with Councilmember Austin and that we hope to find a fruition on there. But no, we don't have anything in Artesia. You will have the opportunity to approve a project in Artesia Boulevard tonight, but it's a shorter piece, and it's a little bit more west of what the redevelopment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'agency was thinking of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I guess, I mean, just to wrap this up, I guess through this conversation, we've narrowed down that I guess my needs are met if we figure out a plan so that I don't have to rob from other projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we work together collaboratively, maybe the way that you worked with Councilmember Austin to figure out a way to ensure that that very important project does have a strategy and a plan when it comes to the city council to fund ongoing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We could certainly work with you on that and see if there's something we can put together. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Richardson, just out of out of curiosity, how much is the funding shortfall for that particular project? So about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My industry. So we haven't had a complete understanding of how large that project is. Last year, when the bond when the bond funds were allocated, there were 450 or so thousand dollars allocated for those meetings. And along with the Atlantic meeting, less a drop in the bucket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So maybe, maybe so maybe we can explore what it would cost to really fully do what their initial plan plans were for those for those meetings. And I'm open to having that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We believe it's about $2 million.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I was my recollection was in that direction as well, more than a half a million dollars. And the reason why I asked a lot of us former council members and then the ones that have retired, we have utilized our one time resources to backfill where redevelopment could not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It went away. And while it's only 900 and some thousand dollars a year, about $1,000,000 a year, that is how we have systematically tried to address the short gap with a large project. It's difficult to do because you leave so many pieces undone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But one of the things that I would like this council to consider, the county of Los Angeles has their long range plan, their long range transit plan. And I believe the last one and the one we're operating out of goes until 2020.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so when we bring up new projects, we're always reminded, well, it's not in the MTA's long range plan. So perhaps something that we can consider during our retreat, not necessarily for this discussion, is work with the mayor and all of us as council members and identify what type of a long range capital plan do we want'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to work toward. Not just that, it's it's council district specific, but that there are projects coming from different council district. But we put it in a long range plan. But then that would also require us to look to fund this incrementally, similar to how we fund the rainy day fund, that we will commit a certain amount of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'surplus dollars to that long range plan, and then perhaps it's divided by nine. But but that would be a way to approach it. Otherwise we would all have certain projects that were not funded by redevelopment. And how to prioritize those among districts is not an equitable conversation, but a long range capital improvement plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whether it goes to 2020 is a little short from long range right now, but perhaps 2040, whatever it is. The other cautionary tale here is when we do use our one time infrastructure dollars for non hardcore infrastructure projects, it leaves that gap for the rest of the city to deal with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I tend to get concerned when we don't use our infrastructure dollars for that because that there might be a street need there, there might be a sidewalk need there, there might be an ADA need there. But in the long range plan, we can at least peel off some of those projects and work toward that as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'an entire city body rather than just having it as a council district issue. So I'd like to see that on our retreat agenda for a conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor In fact, when we do have a five year plan, it's more of a laundry list of projects. None of them are funded and they're certainly not prioritized per district or anything. But we certainly could present that at the retreat and show that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think part of that has to be a funding scheme as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. At this stage, we don't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. On the airport, Bill, page 28, you have airport terminal area improvements. Can you describe what with that? What improvements are we talking about?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for bringing this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think the department indicated that they needed 500,000 just for repairs and as needed construction projects for the for that purpose. I don't know if there's anybody from the airport that they can articulate that. No, I think it was you talking are you asking about the runway improvements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what is terminal area improvements?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So the terminal is is. Let me read it for you. These are the high usage areas, I guess, that lead for need for unforeseen repairs and improvements. So that basically you're looking for repairs in the high usage areas of off the terminal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So in other words, it's just basically maintenance of the airport.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You want to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Clean up some needed repairs in restrooms and walkways and those common areas. That's an example.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry, Councilmember. So the additional improvements that we need includes the historic terminal. We have some work that needs to continue to be done. There's a high trafficked area there with the with the airport. We completed the work with the new concourse, but we still have some more some work, some additional work that needs to be completed with'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the pre security areas that the associated with the airport.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I just needed a little bit of clarification. I think I got a little bit already. The question is for Mr. Malloy. And first of all, thank you for the very comprehensive report regarding 415 of the proposed IP budget to and your department on my question is about all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that all you got to do? I'm sorry. I can't hear. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. You've done quite a bit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The hard work of the public works department, particularly in the eighth District and throughout our uptown communities. You guys have done a wonderful job with our streets, our sidewalks, our parks, and we hope to see a whole lot more work done in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hopefully, we as a council will fund more infrastructure projects moving forward. There were two priority projects for particularly my district that I didn't hear about, but I did find in the actual CHP budget on and one was the Market Street Project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I didn't see it listed as a proposed project, but I do understand that there is going to be some engineering work done. I mean, at 515. And then the other one was the phase two of Davenport Park. I noticed in the Parks and Recreation CHP budget, there's about $100,000 for bike lanes in parks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have we given any other consideration for phase two of that, completing that project? Thank you, Councilmember Austin. Allow me to thank you first for your comments. And second, in regards to your first comment, in a month or so, I'll be coming to you and presenting the payment management plan that will that part of the payment management plan'",
        "'speaker_6': 'will give us the tools necessary to choose which streets are next to be repaired and rehabbed based on the dollars that we have. So I'm hoping that market is on that one, but I want it to wait and finish that analysis, which is going to be very comprehensive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm hoping that you will see that and you'll appreciate it. The amount of work that has gone into it. As far as the Park project, I'm I will ask Mr. Chacon if he has he has that in his CHP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember. Mayor. Yeah. I think there's $1,000,000 for Devonport, the closure of Devonport for phase two. You know we have a community meeting coming up to discuss future plans and we need that plan for the actual closure of the site so that we can move forward with the potential park site in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I understand.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We actually allocated that million dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In last year's budget, correct? Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then and let me just say, in looking at the the CLP proposed budget plan, the projects that have been done and the proposed projects, I think it shows great balance for the public works department across the city and it speaks a lot about says a lot about your management.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Bryce made a long thought.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just quickly, I'm curious about the light rail transit related improvements. Are those dollars we anticipate having returned to us once we make the investment? Are they blue line? Related projects. They would have to be, of course, but.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These are funded by property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Seeing those are all the council questions. I'm going to open it up. If there's any members of the public that would like to comment on the budget and then we'll be moving on to public comment and so forth after the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So on specific to the hearing, please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That evening mayor Garcia city council members and the city I'm just elated on the part of is just so thorough and so well prepared and so inclusive and living in such a diversely, diverse city. I'm so happy to say everything that's been included.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The homeless people with disabilities and very low, low income. And it's I want to commend you for that. You have made so much progress. Looking forward to lots more progress being made is exciting. The $200,000 is set aside for the libraries.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know whether or not a certain portion will be specifically set aside in that amount for the Information Center for People with Disabilities for Children and Disabled Adults. That needs special types of services. Unfortunately, we have more and more disabled persons coming back from the war, and they're in need of having certain types of things to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'improve their life, a form of therapy, rehabilitation, improve their quality of life. So I'm just giving it to you. I don't know if you have a certain percent, but I think it may be something that's worth considering. Terms of having an eight day response program for the sidewalk, for the everything in the city, I think that's phenomenal'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I think it'd be great to get the message out to the people as to how they go about getting their information and who they contact and everything. I wanted to say, in terms of projects that are not complete and I know Manny doesn't go on a train.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm looking at a letter dated November nine, 2004, regarding the universally accessible playgrounds, and at that particular point they had completed 39 and had a 39 out of 42. But there's a universally accessible playground by Shane's inspiration and Eldorado Park that remains still not completed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's mentioned in this letter. It's mentioned is put on hold until all the playgrounds for the entire city have been made accessible. So I know it's going to take funding. I'd like to look into it to move for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I do think that this playground, it will be for children and adults able by the end disabled to be able to play together. It's essential that we have such an opportunity which will increase sensitivity and understanding. And I wanted there was one of a couple of our but the dock at Alameda Space landing it is still'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not complete it is urgent to please look forward into time to get the dog for the aqua loop for mommy's chance to complete it. They're going to extend their service September 5th through October 26, 2014. That take a stand by people that are disabled to be able to use that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From experiences.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, good afternoon, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council in Gary Shelton's My Name addresses to four zero Chestnut Avenue Councilmember O'Donnell highlighted the 25 or $24 million, whatever it is, of money that's going to be coming back from the state.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know when Director Bodak first mentioned that to the Community Investment Company Board, they immediately said, we need a special meeting right now to draft a letter to the city council to express our desire to that that that money be earmarked completely for the what would have been the 20% set aside for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So having listened to your acceptance, your evening victory speech, Mr. Mayor, and also your speech at the inauguration, we heard something out here in the community that, frankly, has not been heard from the mayor's lips in the 20 years prior to your election.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's that we need to pay attention to the one in five of us who are living in poverty. We need to finally step up and do something about that. The fact that this $25 million is coming back is really only about 15 months worth of what the old redevelopment money was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was on a on a continual train that was coming through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it is what it is. I wanted to point out to you that it will probably have to do some some real soul searching and some new discussions, I think, that were mentioned related to that, to put it into the housing trust fund, because it is earmarked as as staff mentioned for very low income families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the housing trust fund is only 50%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Earmarked for extremely low income families. The other part is earmarked for above median. And so that being the case, the something has to happen to the housing trust fund, probably an amendment to the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Depending on how.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Quickly that money's going to come down the pike out of Sacramento. That ordinance should be amended and in place by the time that happens sooner, better than later. And so I just wanted to get that on your radar.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was what I perked up my ears when I heard it in the report earlier today, and I just wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Underscore it and highlight it. Thank you very much. Thank you. And just so you know, we've actually have a discussion with management. So we understand that the housing trust fund formula, we have to look at adopting that. And so one thing I've asked the management to do is to reach out to the housing partners, and we're going'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to have to restructure the housing trust fund in a way that all that money has to go to the low income level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for mentioning that. I wanted to say that, you know, as a former member of the Board of Housing, Long Beach and a current member of the homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not homeless services, but homeless coalition, the public stands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the ready to help you guys through that process, too. Right. Thank you. Very good. You can't to be clear as the address won't address the item that was reference the judging stand at the Marine stadium that is in that plan and also not it's also scheduled but not was not presented is the raising of yet another'",
        "'speaker_2': 'structure in the Marine Stadium. It's important that people understand that the the organic nature of the Marine Stadium is such it provides an Egis which coupled with the Marine where the Coastal Act prohibits removal of those structures. They may be repurposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They may be repurposed as tools will be repurposed. The dollar amount that was allocated and I saw at one point the for the judging stand was a half a million dollars. That's absurd. That doesn't need to be done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What does need to be done is the simple installation of some bollards on the corners. So the bumpers from these do not hit into the brick. But the position of that obviously is not going to be relocated. It's it's positioned there by the findings and determinations of Archimedes, Copernicus and Galileo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It cannot and will not be moved. But it's important to note that any structure that is in the Marine Stadium may not be removed. It can be repurposed, but it's there by the very unique grant deed. That's the certificate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You require the city to create that venue for one purpose and one purpose only boating. It's not a site for flea markets. It's not a site for arts and craft markets or dog shows or flower shows. It's a venue for boating, VOA TNG.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All the facilities there are designed to support that and the California coast to act holes that they may not be removed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council members and city staff. My name is Laura Merrifield. I'm representing the Long Beach Language Access Coalition. And I come with a pretty simple ask today. So a year ago, in August of 2013, City Council voted and passed a language access policy for our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The parts of that policy have started to be implemented. Largely, the policy remains unfunded. So last year Council did direct staff to fund this policy, but that was not done. So this year we're coming and asking very explicitly that this policy is funded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to thank Councilmember Richardson for recognizing the importance of staff that can oversee and work on this policy. Though a partial full time that is supervising various community projects is still separate from the position listed in the policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we are asking for that funding at the 1.2 million listed in last year's policy, which is that the full level implementation, which would include a staff position but also other things document translation, voicemails, city staff training and others.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, the budget, especially the mayor's budget recommendations, speak to technology, innovation, investment in our community, but it leaves out language access. And this is really a critical, crucial piece and engagement of our residents and of course, for the growth of our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Language access is an ongoing issue. This council will actually hear that issue in the coming weeks. But we have to ensure that this policy is funded now and that we don't let another year pass by with no action and no movement on the policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So on behalf of our limited English proficient community, I urge you to fully fund this policy. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next week. We.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Amelia. And the of the members of the Earth. My name and tune that I am living in the 30 and of what was then the avenue launched by California. And I slowly settle for yes, I am here to support the delivery of the policy and the policy of the Cambodian community and to feel looked like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'comfortable and to speak of the city and then to another department and look like what I now look like right now, that I feel comfortable that speaking to you. And then I asked you that to to have from that the language access the policy that in the city the budget.'",

And I live at 915 East Ocean Boulevard 9002. I'm here tonight to urge you to allocate money for affordable housing in this year's budget.'",

These are things that I'm scared to do. The thing is, these issues are often linked to the fact that these families cannot afford safe and quality housing.'",

It should also believe in proportional refunding of programs from whence the money was cut. We would like to work together with you to ensure this tax increment money returns to the housing budget.'",

And unfortunately, the conversation quickly devolved on over an argument of semantics. Some people called them boomerang funds. Many from city staff called them tax increment dollars.'",

I want to make a comment about why 20% was projected originally. Right. When we're looking at reinvestment and redevelopment in neighborhoods, 80% is going to new business development and economic development.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'The state opportunities that the mayor mentioned, like the cap and trade bill, are excellent, but state dollars tax credits can only be leveraged if there is a local source here in Long Beach.

Also, I just want you to know that Mr. West and I also discussed I know there's been interest to have a point person at the city that could work on developing a kind of long term strategy and discussion about how we actually do this the right way.'",

So based on this recommendation, it seems pretty general to me. And I remember there was a motion associated with the downtown plan a few years back that was very similar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, the motion was, Hey, why don't you come back with some recommendations, Mr. City Manager, on how to address local a local citywide local hire policy. And then a memo came back and the memo said that it wouldn't be employment, be able to be implemented here in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this recommendation is very similar, and I want to ensure that this recommendation doesn't end up in the land loss legislation. I want to make sure that this is real and that there's a strategy. So I guess I guess the first question is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ms. City Manager, how would you approach something like this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I couldn't answer that at this time. This is the first we're hearing about this. We if we did, the previous thing that you're talking about was just specifically identified for the downtown. I know that the council has asked for information on plays in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have had reports on that. Last year we could resurface that. But again, I'm just interested in hearing what the council direction is so that we can go forward and heed that direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So if we were to craft a policy, a citywide policy, would departments like the Port of Long Beach or the water department that that are independent authorities? Would those be governed by something like this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I might have to turn that over to the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor or members of the council. Councilman Richardson. The answer to that would be no. They would need to take a separate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Action of their board as they have independent jurisdiction under the charter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Actually, I think and these are the kinds of questions we want to explore, and this is why we're kicking it into the city manager's hands. And again, I don't know that Mr. City necessarily agree to that, because what if you made it an ordinance, then it might to be applicable to those to those other organizations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe we have some other ordinances that are applicable, so we don't have to answer that question tonight as much as that's a very legitimate question. And those are the kind of questions we want to explore by sending it over to the city management team so that they can develop a potential policy and absolute responses when we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'send it over. I just want to I think he wants some direction, and I appreciate you folks bringing this on. But, you know, before we vote on it, I just want to be able to ensure that what we're voting on is real.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we what happened with the city met with the downtown plan. I remember it was a motion to pull out that out of the downtown plan and craft a citywide policy. So I just want to have have some clarity on what's the difference between this and that to ensure that this is a real effort.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition, I'm sure that there will be a process to negotiate with, you know, stakeholders as as Councilmember Yanga mentioned. I would imagine the LLC Building Trades Council will be a part of that. I would imagine a number of the trades we're here would be a part of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I guess I'd like to better understand what that negotiation process would look like and that and understand that this motion gives the city manager the ability to go out, identify those stakeholders who are mentioned, and begin to negotiate and craft a policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then the the portion that talks about local workforce training, I think that's really important. I think that's the most impressive part of this of this recommendation. In terms of my predecessor, Councilmember Neal worked with a number of folks to try to integrate clergy and to do an outreach to Pacific Gateway and try to place folks into apprenticeships'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I'd love for for something like this, if we're going to have this direction to really look at that pipeline, how folks, kids from North Long Beach or Central Long Beach or whatever can actually land apprenticeships and do work building our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that would be a that's a great vision. And I just want to ensure that while we have the opportunity to talk about it, we're very clear about what it is that we want to do. So again, thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think veterans is another piece we can we can look at integrating. So thank you so much for that. And I just wanted to be able to to give that that direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Andrews. Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, I want to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank my colleagues for really also bringing this to the floor, because this is a great policy for Long Beach to uphold. You know, the lack of jobs that hurts our city and our nation. You know, it's a part of the economic recovery.'",

But I also wanted to celebrate Councilmember Andrews, regardless of what project it is, every project that would come up, he would always ask for and make an amendment when appropriate for local hire.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you may have felt like a broken record, but it seems like the council has heard you. Sir, thank you for being that consistent voice for for local hire, which I know we could always count on Councilmember Andrews for raising that issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My question when you come back, Mr. City Manager City Manager West, is if you could let us know what the dollar threshold is and what is or is not counted in that figure. That would be important when we consider what other cities have done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it was mentioned in the item that other cities have similar policies or counties or government agencies and be helpful to know what their threshold is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And then the other piece, Mr. City Attorney, I know that you were leaning forward to answer. I personally would like to know for our enterprise funds, whether it's the port or water or gas and oil. If it were an ordinance, would it capture those agencies as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In certain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Departments?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It may get to those. As Councilmember O'Donnell pointed out, the the exception would be if you're using tidelands funds or restricted funds, there may be issues with the local hire requirement, but we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Need to address that and look at that while we're developing a policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They can. They've done it on the Joe Desmond Bridge, for example. So those can work. We just have to be able to word it carefully.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that it would be fit within the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm going to open this up now to public comment. So please come forward and we'll start with the mayor of Carson City, Jim dear.'",
