And obviously, following the murder of George Floyd last year, one of the proposed reforms called for in policing at the federal and state levels was to create a nationwide registry of law enforcement'",

The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed the House of Representatives in March of 2021, and among its provisions, the Act would create a nationwide police misconduct registry at the Justice Department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, as we all know, the prospects of passing the Senate and becoming law still remain uncertain. This is also one of the reforms identified here that are all city of Long Beach. One of the action items in the city's initial report on Racial Equity and Reconciliation Initiative.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And that's a quote from our our own policy. And this if that was passed, tonight's recommendations specifically address this goal. The USC Price Safe Communities Institute is working on establishing the first comprehensive, publicly available national catalog to collect data regarding officers fired or who resigned because of misconduct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Law enforcement agencies will also be able to access this critical analytical data regarding trends as well as patterns of potential miscount conduct casualties. The database is named for late civil rights pioneer Representative John Lewis. It's called the Law Enforcement Work Inquiry System or Lewis Registry.'",

And we all know that our city, Long Beach, has been proactive in recent years to implement policies addressing the use of force.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'There's a couple of things that we hope to achieve with this. Number one, all neighborhoods, communities want transparency with their agencies. We think we can have this now because we'll have a database. It's publicly available. I used to be a background investigator and now Background Office officers can go to the Lewis registry and in a matter of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'seconds, save thousands of dollars and many hours to find out that the applicant sitting across from them might be someone who's been fired someplace else. And you all know that California is one of five states in the country that when you get fired, you keep your certification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we want to eliminate that and keep armed officers from wandering. We are a research university, so obviously we're all about data. So we intend to collect information so we can come up with predictive indicators that can reduce the risk of officers having these problems and getting terminated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Increased retention in his department. And last but not least, we hope to influence policy. When I was at Santa monica, we had term limits on special details like narcotics and gangs because of the challenges that those officers may face after long periods of assignment in those roles.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'This past couple of months, we reached out to 360 law enforcement executives, mostly municipal chiefs across the United States. We asked them, do you support creating a national registry of law enforcement officers who've been fired for misconduct? 76% said yes, whether they supported it or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We then asked them in the second question if the national registry existed. Would you use the registry as part of your applicant screening process? Almost 95% said yes. I'll just end this by saying we have a diverse collection of supporters.'",

We have the support of Art Acevedo to major cities chiefs. We have activists, we have academics, we have citizens, we have communities, and we hopefully have you.'",

And, you know, and we've seen the possible outcome of police misconduct, and we should do what we can to avoid it. And I and this the chair of the Public Safety Committee and previous member of the Citizen Police Complaint Commission, building accountability within LPD is very'",

It has been a while, but I always appreciate your presentations and the great work that you're doing and I'm in full support of this item. And if I can be of any help in onboarding additional agencies, please don't hesitate to ask or we're definitely grateful for what you're doing.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So it's an honor to have you here in the city, sir. This is a conversation about transparency. I think as members of the public, we can see various examples of why, you know, 18,000 plus law enforcement agencies across America should have the opportunity to have open ended dialog with one another about misconduct and past and former members'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the police departments in various parts of the country. Should we, you know, municipalities should know who they're hiring and who they might not know who they're hiring. You know, we had a members of a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department gang clique, colloquially known as the Lynwood Vikings that had a Justice Department investigation in the late eighties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And a couple of members were fired and then proceeded to be hired later on into the Dallas Police Department and then create more misconduct. You know, when there's a pattern and behavior here is it needs to be public discourse, both from the community and on the municipal side with who is wearing these uniforms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a great opportunity to to disconnect the good from the bad. And I think that the city of Long Beach would be a leader.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. So I wanted to chime in and just say, I think this is a great resolution. Resolutions can have an important make an important impact, particularly when other jurisdictions will follow you. And Long Beach has a history of when we move, other jurisdictions move, being a large, you know, second largest city in L.A. County and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the second largest city in the entire 191 city sky region. This is important. So thank you, Councilman Ellison, for bringing it forward. I think this is one of many tools out of last year's reconciliation process, a number of tools.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they don't have to all be local tools. They can be statewide or regional and national tools to help us turn the corner and and be a city that really leans into racial equity. And this is a tool that I think just makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm happy to support this resolution today. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Something awesome.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just wanted to thank my colleagues and the public for speaking out. Thanks for the presentation, Dr. Suthers. I wanted to ask a couple of questions of our own police department. I see Chief Luna kind of cued up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What is our current? Recruitment and training practices for four lateral officers hired into the department. Former officers were hired into the department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Mayor. Members of the city council. Thank you, Councilman Austin, for bringing this item forward. And the question for any lateral officer, just like any officer that we hire. I'd like to think that we have the highest of standards actually, for anybody who applies, less than 2% of the people who apply become Long Beach police officers because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our standards are so high. We background everybody. We spend about 40 or 50 hours just to make sure that you fit our qualifications. So from a perspective of hiring anybody who has been terminated for a cause for it from another police department, we just don't hire those kind of people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, if somebody has been dismissed for maybe report writing or something else, that's something we may look at. But it's rare. But if you have anybody that's been dismissed from another police agency for moral turpitude, moral turpitude, ethical reasons, policy violations, which would include use of force and officer involved shootings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We just do not hire.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that might speak to my second question. To your knowledge, has or does Romney's police department employ any formerly terminated officers, officers who have been terminated for misconduct? Currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During the six and a half years that I've been chief of police. No, I have not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, that's refreshing. And and, you know, I think this action tonight actually speaks to to transparency, accountability, all of the. Things that our community cares about, but also this council cares about. I think this item is one that obviously I support and encourage my my colleagues to support.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think of us participating in this registry will make us a. Because stand out as a city but also plants our flag and that we care about the the the integrity of the work and understand that it's a privilege to be a police officer in the city of Long Beach or any city for that matter.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are my comments. Again, thank you so much for indulging me and appreciate your chief for pronouncing those questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Make a contribution to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you all for bringing this forward. Councilmember Austin. Sorry. Dr. Summers out of here. Remember me? But when you were here, you worked in Long Beach for a couple of years as our youth coordinator, I think, if I'm not mistaken.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At that time, I was a recruitment officer for the city of Long Beach. And as I constantly say, what am I? Duties at that time was to recruit for police officers. Ah. We had a lateral officer opportunity. That was a continuous examination opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During that time, I'm not sure that we still have lateral officers that posted as a job opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, sir, we do. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we still get some applications or guessing of other officers from other jurisdictions and other departments as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do. It's a few, not as many as we do on our own when we recruit, hire and train them ourselves, sir.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think that this motion here, I think, is long overdue. There was always a concern that could I be out in the field recruiting? And I had officers recruit with me to go find the best and the brightest to work for the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was always that concern being raised about laterals. They're not they're not the most. That that they're not the most qualified. But there's there's issues. There's a reason, as they would say, why they want a lateral from one department to another.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I never heard that they didn't want to come into law because it was about because it was the best that that was always at the top of their intent is to come to the best department that they could possibly find.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So. But at the end of the day, it's about backgrounds and how qualified are they? And is there any kind of a blemishes on their on the record that we need to know about, and especially those that the chief mentioned that are of grave concern, especially when you talk about violations of policy or others, other things in'",

You also worked in D.C., so I mean, you're just very, very proud that I got to know you and still know you.'",

        "'speaker_4': '44% among those 18 to 24. And 12% for those 0 to 17, which includes a large proportion of individuals who are ineligible for the vaccine currently. On the right is the graph of percent vaccination by race ethnicity, which shows that many ethnicities are clustered around the 55 to 60% mark of fully vaccinated, with native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders'",
        "'speaker_4': 'having the highest percentage of their population fully vaccinated at 61%, followed by whites at 59%, then Asians at 57%, and American Indian Alaskan natives at 56%. Then there's a significant gap in percentage of fully vaccinated individuals, with 37% of Hispanic Latinos fully vaccinated and 35% of blacks African-Americans fully vaccinated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this slide shows post-vaccination infections or what is commonly called breakthrough infections and gives some information about variants. The good news is that it's pretty uncommon for someone who's fully vaccinated to be infected with COVID 19. 0.34% of the 249,268 Long Beach residents who have been fully vaccinated have become infected with COVID 19 and only 0.14% of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'fully vaccinated people have been hospitalized due to COVID 19 and 0.00. 8% of fully vaccinated people have died due to COVID 19. The graph on the right shows the different variants that have been detected in Long Beach. There have been several different types of variants detected in Long Beach, but starting in late June, the vast majority of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'samples sequenced from Long Beach residents have shown the Delta variant. And as Kelly mentioned, 93% of the cases that had data was due to the Delta variant. The slide reviews vaccine effectiveness. So all three vaccines, the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe disease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're all greater than 80% effective at preventing infection. The CDC is looking at the possibility of winning immunity several months after vaccination. They've all been shown to be greater than 90% effective at preventing hospitalization and death. So this slide illustrates how much more contagious the Delta variant is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Someone infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that started this pandemic would be estimated to infect about two other people. That's over on the left. The Alpha variant or what was known as the U.K. variant, was 50% more transmissible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so one person could now infect 4 to 5 others. And now the Delta variant is twice as contagious as other variants, and one person infected with the Delta variant can infect up to 5 to 8 other people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the Delta variant is definitely more formidable than the original Wildtype virus. It spreads more than twice as easily than previous variants. New data is also showing that people infected with the Delta variant have higher viral loads than previous variants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's more virus living in their nose and mouth that can then be transferred to other people. I'm fully vaccinated. People infected with the Delta variant may also be infectious, be able to transmit the virus to others. So a high vaccination coverage will reduce the spread of the virus and help prevent new variants from emerging.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As overall cases increase and the proportion of the population vaccinated increases, we can expect to see more breakthrough cases. But the bottom line is that the COVID 19 vaccines continue to be effective. Most breakthrough infections are mild, and the COVID 19 vaccines prevent severe illness, hospitalizations and deaths from Delta.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the vaccines are working as we would expect them to. Just more graphs about how the vaccine protects you from getting infected and being hospitalized or dying from COVID. So on the left, this is Long Beach data and the solid blue lines show the case rate among unvaccinated in the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The case among those who are vaccinated in the dark blue and then those who are unvaccinated in the solid light blue line. And you can see that the case rate is much higher in those who are unvaccinated. And then the dotted lines down there towards the bottom.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So hospitalization rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. And again, the rate of hospitalization is significantly higher among unvaccinated individuals. With the red dotted line down in those who are vaccinated with the yellow dotted line. And then the graph on the right is national data, and it's showing that if you're fully vaccinated, you are eight times less likely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to become infected with COVID and you're 25 times less likely to be hospitalized or to die of COVID. So to summarize the data, all of the vaccines work to produce to reduce infections, hospitalizations and death, even against the the delta variant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The biggest reduction is in hospitalizations and deaths. We are seeing cases and fully vaccinated people and this is because there are a lot of fully vaccinated people out there. But when you look at everyone who's fully vaccinated, the chances of becoming infected with COVID are quite low 0.35% of all those who are fully vaccinated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's also a lot of virus out there, and the vaccine is not 100% effective at preventing infections. So for all of those reasons, that's why we can expect to continue to see cases in fully vaccinated. Now just to review the vaccine related health orders that have come out recently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So July 26, the California Department of Public Health released a state public health order. Which required that in a set of high risk facilities, that all facilities must verify the vaccination status of their workers and they must test unvaccinated workers regularly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And all workers must wear surgical masks. So this order applied to acute care hospitals or medical surgical hospitals, long term care facilities, including our skilled nursing facilities, and then a whole list of other health care settings including but not limited to doctor's offices, acute psychiatric hospitals and substance use treatment centers, and then also to high risk congregate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'settings such as homeless shelters, adult and senior day health facilities and correctional and detention. And then subsequently on August 5th, another state public health order was released and this one required all health care workers to receive their first dose of a one dose regimen or their second dose of a two dose regimen of a COVID 19 vaccine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by September 30th. And this requirement in religious and medical exemptions were allowed. If a worker received a medical or religious exemption, then they must test regularly. And the list there is who this what type of facilities this order applied to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then on top of that, another order came out also on August 5th, which required visitors to verify their vaccination status or show proof of a negative COVID 19 test in order to visit an acute care hospitals or long term care facilities and skilled nursing facility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then with regards to school settings, on August 9th, Obie USD announced that they would require vaccination verification of all school workers and regular regular screening testing of all unvaccinated workers. This was followed on August 11th by a state public health order, which required that all public and private schools must verify the vaccination status of all their'",
        "'speaker_4': 'workers and that all unvaccinated workers would have to undergo regular screening. Testing. In the state also updated some of their guidance and requirements around mega events. And they updated the definition of an indoor mega event or large event from 5000 participants to 1000 participants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So participants of indoor events of greater than 1000 individuals will be required to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID 19 test prior to entering. So a summary of the orders as they relate to the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities are required to verify vaccination status of their workers and visitors, test all unvaccinated visitors and require vaccination of workers and test exempted workers. Other health care settings such as doctor's offices, psychiatric hospitals, dialysis centers, etc. are required to verify vaccination status of their workers and to require vaccination'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of workers and to regularly test exempt workers. Other high risk congregate settings, homeless shelters, etc. are required to verify vaccination status of its workers and regularly test all unvaccinated workers. And public and private schools are required to verify vaccination status of its workers and regularly test all unvaccinated workers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In addition to the state orders, Long Beach has added that masking is required in all public indoor spaces. It's required masking outdoors for large scale events of more than 10,000. Participants and we've added Dennis and home health care agencies to the vaccine mandate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So given all of the state health orders, there's been a lot of movement in more local health orders and expanding some of the different verification and mandate systems to other to other businesses. So a number of jurisdictions have moved forward with vaccine and testing requirement for their employees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the state, L.A. County and our city have implemented vaccine verification or testing for unvaccinated employees. Ours was announced on July 27. L.A. City and San Francisco are requiring all employees to be vaccinated with only medical and religious exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'San Francisco tied theirs to full FDA approval, which happened on Monday. So in ten weeks from now, all employees must be vaccinated. A number of cities have also implemented vaccine mandates for specific high risk indoor settings. All are including indoor food service areas, including bars, restaurants and other indoor food service establishments because mass must be removed in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the space to eat and drink. Other cities are also including indoor gyms and fitness centers, giving patrons have elevated breathing and often heavy exertion, which can increase the transmission. New York is one of the more expansive with mandates, including a wide variety of indoor entertainment and recreation facilities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you'll see the list there on the slide. More locally, Palm Springs passed a mandate for vaccines or testing for indoor spaces of restaurants and bars, as well as large scale ticketed events. The City of Los Angeles has directed their city attorney to establish an ordinance that goes further than all the other mandates I've seen, as it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'includes retail establishments in the mandate. This ordinance is still being written and we're watching to see how they define retail establishments. The L.A. County Board of Supervisors asked the Los Angeles County Public Health Department to develop a report with considerations and recommendations for possible vaccine mandates that port roads deliver today and will be discussed at next week's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Board of Supervisors meeting. Their considerations include high risk indoor settings where masks are removed, such as restaurants and bars, as well as entertainment establishments where food is served indoors. They're also considering fitness facilities giving high levels of exertion and often ill fitting masks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Health and Human Services Department has been tracking on all of these developments and reviewing and utilizing a number of different considerations. The first focus is on the science of the vaccine and transmissibility of the virus. What businesses would have the highest risk settings for people who are unvaccinated, particularly young people under age 12 who aren't currently'",
        "'speaker_4': 'eligible for vaccine? We also look at the level of transmissibility in the community, and right now that transmissibility is high. We also consider the risk to those who may be vaccinated but have compromised immune systems and are more susceptible to transmission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We look at the risk level of the facilities. We know that masks reduce transmission. But when we must when people must remove the mask to participate in the business, the protections are gone. These include indoor restaurants and bars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It could also include entertainment businesses who serve food as an ancillary service, such as a movie theater or a family fun zone. We also consider levels of exertion and the capacity to effectively wear a mask in most spaces.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fitness centers would be considered their. Other considerations to take to take into consideration are that support wellness but focus on equity and access to services for people. We wonder, you know, we look at whether the business is essential to daily living, such as a grocery store, a bank, hair salon, clothing store, etc., or a mask can be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'worn during the whole visit. We also look at equity considerations. We still have many who do not trust the vaccine nor the government. We continue to work closely with these communities and we are seeing progress. But moving forward with mandates, absent other options for people, it is an equity concern for access to essential services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Small minority owned businesses would also likely struggle first to be able to implement the mandate, and second, because many of their patrons may choose not to come to the business. If a vaccine is mandated. We're also looking at impacts on businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They'll need digital QR code readers to be able to look at the to be able to read the digital vaccine records and a person to check at the door. These have financial impacts. You'll also need the ability to mediate situations if someone is angry because they can't come in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city's ability to enforce the mandate is also a consideration. We have hundreds of bars, restaurants, fitness and entertainment businesses and enforcement takes time and resources. And finally, we would support a regional or statewide approach. We think this is really important for consistency, to support understanding among our businesses, community members and for enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are actively reviewing data trends and mandates from other jurisdictions. Our goal is to work to address the high risk indoor situations, to provide the greatest level of safety for the patrons of those businesses, as well as employees of those businesses who interact with patrons while also taking into consideration the equity issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some jurisdictions are mandating vaccinations to push people toward getting vaccine, so they're incorporating a broader spectrum of businesses. We are working on an approach that focuses primarily on safety and addressing risk. We anticipate the possibility of an upcoming health order based on all of these considerations and what we are seeing in transmissibility and vaccine uptake.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That concludes our presentation and we're open for questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I really appreciate the health department. I want to again, just think about the copy and copy, Dr. Davis, for not just the report, but just the incredible work since the pandemic started and even before. We have a great team at the Long Beach Health Department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're very, very grateful for for this work. I have a couple comments and then I want to do have a question or two. And then any of the council also has any comments. We'll we'll we'll go there as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I want to and if I do that, Madam Court, can you reload the screen? I think the. The queue system is not up yet. There it is. Thank you very much. Let me just say a few a few just general comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to just first note, and I think it's important to note when we have these discussions that there's there's there's real lives and people behind everyone that has passed. As of today, we have lost almost 970. I think we're at 969 individuals from our community that have died due to the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are moms and dads and kids and sisters and brothers and grandparents. And it is and remains the largest loss of life that we've ever had. I mean, this amount of time in the history of our city and in an emergency this large, it's always important to center our conversations around those that are impacted the most.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know I for the 969 families and the countless more that that are living with with deep health conditions or other types of trauma, please know that you are in our thoughts every single day and that we work and we and we struggle with these with these with these issues because we want to save every life'",
        "'speaker_3': 'possible. And it's important that the most important things that we can do. As it relates to the pandemic, is to try to save as many lives as possible and keep people as safe as possible. I also want to just say that the the 76% eligible adults number that we have that we hit, I think today, actually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is incredibly impressive. And in light of of the horrors of the of the pandemic and still the work that is ahead of us, I just do want to thank our vaccination team for. For reaching that metric. And even when you look at the 12 plus population, that's almost it's on its way to 74%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think maybe it's maybe in the mid 70 threes. But that is also an impressive number. When you look at just when you look at the 12 plus number and when you look at the 18 plus number, which is kind of which is the what the state uses as their as their state metric.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is very, very impressive. And I'm more optimistic than ever that we are going to hit 80%, you know, in the weeks ahead. I think that was a number that many of us hoped that we could hit at some point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's still going to be difficult, but we are we are on our way there. And on the vaccination front, this work would not be possible, wasn't just the city's work, but we have countless community organizations, countless hospitals and clinics, community organizers, nonprofits that are knocking on doors, that are setting up pop up tents and parks, that are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'going to churches to get the vaccination vaccinations done. And I just want to thank every single one of those groups and volunteers, staff members that are out on weekends and nights trying to educate and vaccinate as much as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of the the information that was presented tonight and a lot of the movement statewide has also been because of Long Beach. And I want to highlight that Long Beach has consistently been a leader on on on vaccines, whether it was being the first restrictions to start vaccinating our teachers and educators or the first to begin'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the grocery workers. I think about our. Dr. Davis, when when you gave the go ahead to start vaccinating people with disabilities that we were doing that before most of the entire state was. And so I think that that has also helped us have a a process that was accessible and continues to be accessible within neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Imperfect, but still but still accessible. And I want to also note that when we when Long Beach Unified became the first the first and largest jurisdiction in the state to put in the vaccination mandate or the weekly test that prompted the very next day the state to do the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm really proud of Long Beach for moving forward and taking a hard step, but an important one with their mandate. Long Beach is and became the the only and largest jurisdiction in the state of California where every public agency had put a vaccine mandate in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city. The school district, the community college, the state university. And if you want to add our partner agencies like the county, you have a essentially all public employees within this city are under the vaccine mandate requirements that we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm very grateful and thankful to the health team for for doing that. I also just want to know that as we move forward, the one thing we also we have to keep in mind and this is really important and at least I believe strongly not everybody does, but the public good always trumps personal liberty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the greater public good and public health have to be considered first and foremost greater than a person's individual belief about their own personal liberty. In that moment. I know that's a difficult conversation, but it's one that I believe strongly that the greater public good must always guide our work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I strongly believe, Dr. Davis, that that that you have always kept in mind as greater public good public health question as you and the team have made decisions about, um, about our future. I'll also add that and I think you noted this at the end it but I think it's important to note.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That right now there is an active conversation across L.A. County and the city of Long Beach about additional vaccine requirements for for businesses, as well as kind of a vaccine check or a mandate that would happen for folks attending certain types of businesses has been reported widely, of course, in the media.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I want to just make sure that at actually this call, if you if you can just respond. And I know that the city of Long Beach currently is having active conversations with L.A. County and are monitoring the discussions around additional vaccination requirements for certain types of businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that the that it could be over the course of the next week or so. It looks like a lot of those conversations around what could possibly be additional restrictions would likely come forward from the L.A. County health officer or perhaps their own health department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that something you're expecting as well?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, L.A. County will be discussing next Tuesday and we'll know the forward motion there. We'll be paying attention to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and as far as our own internally, we are as a as a city and as a health team, having active conversations about everything you mentioned as it relates to impacts to businesses, a safety for employees, equity considerations and how, you know, technology would be integrated into a decision of that magnitude.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Well, I just want to just share and I think I've mentioned this, you know, privately, I always do. But I will. I always have and I always will continue to support the decisions made by the doctors and scientists of the Long Beach Health Department that continued, in my opinion, to do everything they can to ensure that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we remain safe and that people remain safe in the community. So I look forward to your additional recommendations and and your and continuing to keep the the Council and myself informed as to the best public public science and health and how we ensure that we protect as many people as possible during what is still a serious health'",
        "'speaker_3': 'crisis and pandemic. And so, again, people, please, if you are if you're not, you've been vaccinated, please get vaccinated. It's the best way to keep people safe. And please know that our I continue to talk to nurses and doctors every single day in our hospitals who are pleading with us to continue to do the right thing and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to not strain the hospital like where we were, of course, in the spike during the wintertime. So with that, I have a this is a receiving file. There's no action that needs to be taken. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So first, thank you, Ms.. Collopy and Dr. Davis, for your presentation. Something that stood out to me was the slide that showed how well we're doing with vaccinations and how the vaccinations are impacting what we're seeing play out with this surge, point 34% of those vaccinated have been infected.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's important to note. That point three, for only 0.3, 4% of people who have been vaccinated have been infected and have had a breakthrough case. That's a really small number. And .014 of people who are vaccinated have been hospitalized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's less than 2% in .000 8%. Of people who have been vaccinated have died. I think first I want to offer my thanks to our health department for leading such a valiant effort on the vaccinations. And and I think we need to underscore the point that the vaccinations work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're working, the data showing that they're working. That said, there's a bit further to go. The rates within that we've seen on some of these slides within communities that are not vaccinated, it's alarming. And if you just, you know, take that and apply it to who the people are that we see in the hospitals or the people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who are getting the the breakthrough cases, the hospitalizations, the deaths, they're skewed toward communities that have not been vaccinated. And so we need to do all that we can to make sure that these communities we do all that we can to make sure that these vaccinations are happening, particularly now that vaccinations are beginning to get, you know'",
        "'speaker_1': ', full approval from FDA. I also think I'm particularly concerned about children because children aren't able to be vaccinated. So quick question with the school vaccination mandate. Now, my understanding is that that applies to both public and private schools.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could you speak to how well the schools are transitioning, getting ready to implement this mandate, both public and private, going into back to school?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you. So the order came out, I guess, about two weeks ago now. Maybe ten days or so. So I think there's a lot of planning that's that's happening right now. We had a conversation with all of the schools this week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had a did a discussion about what the new guidance is and offered our resources. And so I think that the schools are very well informed of what the mandate is and how to verify the vaccination status. And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think just putting their plans together for the upcoming school year, which from what I could gather, it's kind of the next week or so, is when most of the schools will be returning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we we I'm particularly concerned about back to school. We've seen during vacation season or back to school, we always get a bump in numbers. And so we can anticipate that we know enough to know that. And so I would love to know how well and what we can do to make sure that we're supporting the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'schools, both public and private, as they get into back to school. And I think we should also expand that to anywhere that we think is child centered, should have a mix, have a vaccination mandate vaccination or a testing mandate because the children can be vaccinated yet and very vulnerable population that we really need to focus on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then in terms of additional measures, I know that, you know, I'm paying attention to discussions. I know there's discussion about additional measures. My philosophy on this is a rather take a pill to offset a heart attack. And to me, wearing masks, getting the vaccination, that's taken a pill to offset a massive cardiac arrest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so if it keeps our economy from shutting down again, if it keeps us from being overwhelmed in our hospitals, then we should we should look at, you know, high traffic areas, you know, sensitive areas. We need to make sure that we're I would be supportive of a mandate in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, I also would be concerned about equity concerns, particularly around grocery stores and things like that. What I don't want is to not think about what the impact could be to food insecurity or if someone has another health emergency and they haven't gotten the vaccination.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't want to discourage them to not go get an STD check or to go do whatever else needs to happen. So we really need to think about those equity considerations. But that said, I think you should explore additional vaccination mandates.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor, and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Events and taking actions that are necessary and protecting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our community. I tell you, we are just so fortunate that we have you as our city health officer. You have kept our community safe, and I'm proud of all of your work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm also proud of the mayor. I know he's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Been very active and just our fearless leader.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And making sure that people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Get shots in those arms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Delta variant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is is pretty scary to me and and it's aggressive and we have to take meaningful steps to stop the spread. My dad, who lives in Florida and my uncle who lives in Washington State, were fully vaccinated and have both contracted COVID.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they are they're really sick. I'm confident that they're going to pull through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm concerned about breakthrough. I mean, I see this number.'",
        "'speaker_4': '.34, but I just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just wonder.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like where this is going. I know they got their vaccinations early and in January and so is our elderly community. You know, are are they at risk? And so I just frankly, I absolutely want to see more stringent mask mandates.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We absolutely need to bounce back and thrive as a city. And I think we have to do everything possible to make sure that that's happening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am encouraged by the private industry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that they're stepping up and demanding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vaccinations, and.'",

And to many of the neighborhood leaders, to many of the organizations that have continue and does do the work of outreaching and educating to our community members how to access the vaccine and and'",

You know, I live in the 90 813 area code, which has the lowest rate of vaccination, lowest rate of vaccination rate, which is at about 65.2% of the population and compared to the 76% of the adult population.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so certainly this is a equity concern for me. I just you know, I know that, you know, I know there's a lot done because I get a flier on, you know, am I am I gate where to access the vaccine.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm wondering I know that there are a lot of. Ways are approaching and making sure that we reach out to people in this area code. But I'm just wondering, what else do we need to do? What else can we do before we have to move towards mandating because of the various concerns that people have?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I am also concerned about our vulnerable population. Those who are, you know, have their immune system isn't as strong. Two children under 12 that hasn't been vaccinated. And our elderly who may need a booster but haven't gotten it yet, that are also vulnerable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I am wondering what else can we do to reach out to those in particularly not just in this area code and others that are still not moving towards the vaccine, getting vaccinated?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We we you know, we continue to outreach and engage with everybody locally. What we're really finding is that it's a relationship, relationship and more relationship. And if you know someone or it went well, you know, those kinds of things.'",

And so we are really working to to sort of tailor messaging, tailor engagements, tailor opportunity to be able to speak to that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And I do hope that we also continue to work with our nonprofit organization helping with outreach and engagement, as well as our faith based community leaders to get their feedback about, you know, what's really working and not as we're getting further information and also at what point, you know, also feedback if we do move to vaccination'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I think part of it also is, is that our many, many partners in vaccine, many of our pharmacies and providers and others. So as as we as we discussed in the slide, we are seeing about a 72% increase in daily and daily first dose vaccines going forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are we are seeing we are seeing increases.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In light of the recent lawsuit decision related to immunity being a component of access to universities versus vaccination. Are we working to have any partners with either the Red Cross or the UCLA antibody study or any of those so that people who have recently had COVID and might.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So your question is, is what does our immunity look like in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What are we doing to give constituents access? Like, I have a neighbor, this whole family had COVID, so in their mind they don't need a vaccination because they had COVID. So they're already immune. But there's no real. And like I was at Memorial today and they said they don't have any antibody testing available for their patients, but'",
        "'speaker_6': 'they UCLA has an antibody study. I don't know if Red Cross is doing antibodies on your donations, but it would be awesome to be able to say, Hey, go donate blood and you can see if you're still immune or not because you might not be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then he and his family might all go get vaccinated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. Right. Okay, I got you. So the antibody testing really is a kind of frontier field. So we're just really not at the point where we can test an individual with an antibody test and be able to determine that they're immune.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's really looking at when we use antibody tests, we really look at the surveillance of an entire community because it's just not accurate enough on a 1 to 1 basis. Okay. Unfortunately, right now and then the other thing that they have seen, you know, everything is still evolving, but you can't get reinfected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So it's felt that you can stay immune for about 90 days after you're infected with COVID, but then after that, you can get reinfected. They are seeing that it's you're more likely to get reinfected if you originally got infected versus you got vaccinated, like how you got your immunity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So that's pointing to the importance of vaccination. So it could be that going forward, you know, they would give you a 90 day reprieve from vaccination. But since they're only giving you 90 days, really right now, the recommendation is that after you're done with your infection, you've done your isolation, that you should get vaccinated because that'",

Just to be clear, budgets reflect, reflect priorities and you and your choice to adopt or ignore the polices the people's budget will make your priorities crystal clear.'",

        "'speaker_10': '25% won't come up to $65 million. That's barely dipping into the bucket. It will hurt the police department to lose 25% of the budget, but it would definitely help the community. There are so many programs to invest in.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So let us defund the police department. Use it for the police department. I mean, use it for the people budget.

        "'speaker_6': 'Despite the shamefully underfunded budget they've been giving, been given, being forced to depend on uncertain grants. I listened to the report by Long Beach Center for Economic Inclusion and how they provided needed resources to feed our community and attempt to support a robust economy here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I listened to the fire department report talk about their accomplishments and programs. I listened to the reports and the tangible things that were accomplished on behalf of the community here in Long Beach. I could clearly understand the value that was added to our community by these departments and programs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I saw that they provide care and needed resources to the community. Not so with the police department report. The LAPD has not shown their value, and especially not at the expense of their budget that consumes nearly half of the general fund.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It was just, you know, give a little more flexibility. What we have today is it's a significant improvement from only 216,000. It's up to 673,000, a significant improvement. I do want to see us do better. That's 67% and do want to see us do better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my first question is I remember the initial list of items were all categories that are consistent with what we talked about in our U.S. resolution, but what is still remaining in those categories for the youth fund?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you mean what is still like what else could be allocated in there?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, I see that like the youth ambassador program. You found another way to fund that. What's remaining in the other 33% has gone to city staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So generally and Grayson, get specifics here, we need dollar amount specific. So we have some staffing to be able to support the youth fund and the youth commission. I think that's really important if we want this to be successful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We then in the health fund, we have funding for Office of Equity, about 50,000, I believe. We also then have the older adult senior program to make that structural. And then what's really left is the ones that I think you would have kind of the most discretion over that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At least I would recommend you look at if you're looking at anything else, and that would be some additional program for our library. So there's about 120 roughly thousand dollars for first team programing, which is science, technology, those types of programs in our libraries and teen mental health programs in libraries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So, so, so in our support, all of those programs, the one thing I would say is what's with it was listed within the youth fund, that library fund, does that have to be conducted by city staff? I think it creates a a double standard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If everyone else has to apply to the youth fund or the libraries get directly funded, like the management of the fund, the youth summit, all that's after you develop that consistent, why wouldn't we just put library funding as a grant to the Library Foundation or some library supporting groups was consistent and we don't continue to whittle away'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at the 75% because we could be at a hard standard and a commitment to the public by doing that. Is that something that you have? Could that work?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so anything's possible. The way we created this was that city staff would be providing that rather than foundation. Sometimes money flows to the foundation when they raise it and then it gets sent back to city staff. We've not explored a model where the foundation have their own staff that provide this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were going to provide it with city staff kind of funded through through the library.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, I see my time is up. I hear from my colleagues that. But I want to see if there's a way, either the end of the year fund savings are not fund savings projections or measure us like even if it performs better, that funding should still be going the way it was structured.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So either that way or by just taking it because I agree with the library funding was structured as a grant because I don't think say the library is any more important than, you know, success and challenges Freedom School or I think they're equally important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we should be fair in how we begin to allocate this funding our paths there. I would love to just hear some feedback from colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Give us your councilman, sir.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. You know, I just want to follow with Vice Mayor Richardson's questioning around the youth fund and in the sense that I also want to thank the PBOC for supporting the increase in funding to make it $1,000,000 for the youth fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do want to explore, you know, I do agree that 75% is a good number as far as ensuring that it goes to the youth. I, I agree that, you know, we trusted young people to lead in developing in developing the strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think we need to be able to trust and be able to determine where the funding should go for their development and investing in them as far as just, you know, the process and to determine terminating exactly those points and, you know, like to explore further how we can ensure that it is about a 75% that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that that that is allocated to young people to determine where that program goes. So that's kind of where where I'm at with this and that I think that we need to indicate to young people that we support their leadership and that they know what is best for them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The other question I have and I want to raise this because I want to make sure that we do at least address how the question about how do we also support our undocumented community members. You know, during the pandemic, there was a lot of funding that went into individuals that undocumented community members weren't eligible for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think we had some general discussion around basic income as a possible avenue. So I'm wondering now, you know, Tom or Mr. Modica or the state or maybe you can clarify what the process would be for our undocumented community member to be able to access the guaranteed income pilot program that will be coming in this fall'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Can I just add something? I think. Rosemary Richardson mentioned. One thing I think that is interesting, which I think is could be part of this custom in Austin, which is that if measure because obviously I think the ABC obviously has gone a lot further than the statue recommendation and you know, pretty close to where with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some of the community input has been and certainly hit the over million dollars actually in request. But perhaps if we can take any overages that happen with measure us. I mean, there's certainly certain funds do perform better sometimes over time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so if the funds are performing better this year or the next year, that those could go directly into the youth fund for that. For that piece that way, I think I think that's a an opportunity for that to grow even beyond the million that might satisfy, I think, some of the smears concerns.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I think. I'd be certainly amenable to doing that. I just I think it's very important that we we we show good faith to our library services as well, because those are that's a proven entity. We know we're going to see thousands and thousands of kids on it on a yearly basis.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I think that keeps the library piece intact and just any overages would go would go there. So I think that's I think that's a slight a slight change to that. Next up is Council on Mango.'",

And I would say I don't think it's a library versus others. I think we just have to think of it all as youth and we all have value, whether you're in a park'",

This would have been subject to a 10% cut. There's at that housing navigation, $1 million based on the the rest of the recovery dollars.'",

It's effectively the same. And so I want the community to understand you're still going to get $1 million fully for housing navigation.'",
