        "'speaker_3': 'as a whole. So we don't see that as a problem. The issue that we see from a legal standpoint is to always make sure that whoever has this information uses it only for the purposes that state law authorizes us to use that.'",

But again, I I'm not sure why any one of us would need this information, but if any one of us do, it should be available to the ire of the entire council.'",

Our concerns yesterday were just to educate the council and the mayor that these two officials could be the only two elected officials in the state that they get this.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Union did. And that's a joke. As I listen, I don't mean to slight the intent here. I just have to say that I'm not convinced it's a good thing for this body to walk down the path of certain members having information that others don't.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So if, you know, if there's some avenue in which we could be have, you know, I don't know, study this further, I could be supportive, but tonight I can't because I see the implications of this as being potentially negative and all this and more.'",

From what I can tell on this ordinance is to basically limit the access to that information to three individuals, two of which are elected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have an issue with that, as has been as has been raised, because I am saying that if they have the information, I want to see that information to as a as an elected member of this body, if they're elected and they have access to it and I'm elected, I should have that same access to it as'",
        "'speaker_5': 'well. So I see issues with that. But perhaps I need some history on this and there's a little bit of that here, but I'm not too clear as to why this needs to be fixed. I mean, there is something broken here that that needs to be fixed where we have these two ordinances that need to be combined'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and that needs to be very specifically identified to being accessible only by these entities as identified here in this ordinance. And that to clear on that and maybe somebody could clarify that for me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who commented on this over to Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so. So yes, something is broken in the city of Long Beach. We have unrealized sales tax revenue at approximately the edge of 18 million ongoing revenue a year. And and no one's asking the question. And so as chair of the Economic Development Economic Development and Finance Committee, I've met with finance on several occasions to come up'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with the things that our committee could discuss and the low hanging fruit to improve the status of our city so that we can afford the things that our constituents deserve, and to set the direction and the policy related to the ability to grow sales tax revenue, the staff have to be able to speak freely related to how'",
        "'speaker_6': 'business impacts happen, related to convention, center, bureau, convention, business. And last year, you'll notice the council asked several questions related to the economic impact of certain conventions and other conventions. And the council was not able to see the details related to those things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the Economic Development Finance Committee would be in a position to better see that information. Additionally, we have some of our partners here from the business community. And when a business looks to move into a community, what happens right now is that our business associations survey businesses in the area to gather the data to provide it back'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And we are able as a city to provide that legally under the current conditions, but we don't. And so one of my questions was, what do we have access to? And they can't tell me. And what are the conditions by which it could be shared?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, in each situation it's different. And so to have an open dialog, we first need at least someone on behalf of us to review the detail to come back to the council and make a longer term recommendation. I think all of you would be surprised to hear that more than tens of millions of dollars are leaking out'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of our pockets on an annual basis as compared to other cities of our size. And so. That's part of the reason why I'd like to find a way. To allow our businesses to be successful and to help them grow and to be able to keep the comparison numbers so that we can make good decisions because we, as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the council, set the direction and policy of this city. And so I would like to help us get to a position where we're realizing our true financial potential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. And I also want just to note that Councilwoman Mongo, when she when she brought this forward, at least to, you know, to my attention, I think her intention is 100% on ensuring that we are maximizing our financial potential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just want to thank you for trying to to think outside the box. But certainly there's there's a lot I think the intention is is a good one. And how we get there is that we're trying to we're having a discussion about cats in Boston.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And, Mr. Mayor, I want to also I want to commend Councilmember Mongo for thinking out of the box and being innovative and thought I'm I'm a little concerned as is Councilmember O'Donnell and Urunga and others have raised about the approach here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, Councilmember Mongo has a background that few of us have, and we have to make be very cognizant of our role here as policymakers moving forward. This is about the institution. And you know, who's to say that, you know, a soccer mom is not going to replace you as chair of the Economic Development and Finance Committee'",
        "'speaker_7': ', who may not have a background to to analyze and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Easy on the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, no, no, no, no, no. That that wasn't a trust me love softball game. My wife's a football mom, you know what I mean? But somebody who doesn't have a finance background, who doesn't or doesn't work with budgets on a daily basis to to to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so there's a reason, I think, that is important to have a separation between administrative functions that the city currently has, as well as legislative functions where policymakers and you know, it could be it could be a union rep in that role who doesn't have the background, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I'm really concerned. I think it's it's risky to go down this road. We are opening ourselves up for a slippery slope. It opens the door for potential. And I'm going to use the C word, corruption. You know, we have to be very careful with the information we have out there, and particularly if it's going to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be limited to to one or two people on this on this body. I mean, I would say that any information that is held in committee should be afforded to every one of the elected officials behind this rail. Each and every one of us represent our districts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We represent this city and been charged to represent this city equally. This is, like I said, traditionally a an administrative role. This could be viewed by some as a power grab. And and, you know, I do recognize that that you want to change the complexity or the complexion of the the Economic and Development and Finance Committee, the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'role of that committee. But I don't I'm not comfortable with going forward with this. And so I would offer a substitute motion to receive and file this motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a second? There's been there's been a second to receive and file. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I want to I got a couple of questions. So, Councilmember Mongeau, it sounds like you articulated your intent for this, and it's largely based on this sales tax leakage issue. Can you just walk me through your understanding of this so I can see where you want to go?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in our early dialogs to set an agenda for the Economic Development and Finance Committee, we have done some extensive background. We've met with a lot of different businesses in different areas, and that I've met with the Department of Finance and Budget and gone over key categories where we are looking, and there are categories that are more'",
        "'speaker_6': 'severe than others. So in certain categories we might be providing or we might be performing at 105% of what, a city of 490,000 people should. And where in other categories were performing at 37% of sales tax income of what a community should.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in those areas, we could still set an economic development agenda. However, we were able to to dwindle it down to the low hanging fruit. We don't want to spend two years in a committee to only increase revenue by 100,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We want to spend two years in a committee increasing the ongoing revenue of the city by 4 million. And so we were able to identify two key areas where the city is suffering. Department stores and apparel where we could pick up millions of dollars of ongoing sales tax revenue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, when we started the next level of conversations, every answer out of finance is. You don't have the authority to know that. And so I thought, what is in there that I can't know to set an agenda for us to get behind a ten year economic development plan that could change the face of the city?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Leah, would you be able to tell us what the current sales tax revenue number annually is? Is it 60 million? I can't remember off the top of my head.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You can actually get down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. I just don't know it. The 60 million annually feels tax revenue for as long. I believe it's more like 79 million. Okay, 79. So theoretically, according to the reports, we are leaking 8 million a year. So 79 plus 18 would put us closer to 100 million of ongoing sales tax revenue a year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And please also know that there are cities that neighbor us who perform at more than 100%. And so we could be one of those cities when we bring certain businesses and incentives to the table. Currently, the way the law is written, we are allowed to see the information on sales tax revenue when it comes to particular deals'",
        "'speaker_6': ', one deal at a time. And I feel that that's very shortsighted in our planning. It's fixing one street at a time without really discussing the adjoining streets.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think, Councilmember, my question is specifically about the leakage issue. Sure. So what example can you give of how you use this information to improve that issue, that problem?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one particular industry is performing at 37%. I'd be able to sit down with those groups and come up with a comprehensive plan that's equitable to help them all increase their revenue as a whole. And we would be able to put together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So you would meet with. So you've identified two sectors that are that are underperforming, would meet with businesses in those sectors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or we would meet with potential. We would instruct staff to meet with businesses in those sectors to bring them back to Long Beach. They might not have a store in long now, so staff would do those meetings. We would set the policy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So can we not say without looking at that data and opening up that can of worms? Staff create a plan, bring it to this council to improve in these sectors where we're underperforming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I guess the question is we don't know what we don't know until we see what we don't.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Know right now. Eight council members don't know. Seven council members don't know what you know right now. And that's the issue that I have. And I guess the other question is a process question. So if so, if we operate in working groups or subcommittees in committees and we're only giving this data to one person of the committee'",
        "'speaker_9': ', how can that committee evaluate a policy decision and make a recommendation to the full body so that when those meetings go to a closed session.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You would be allowed to see the revenue when it comes to a decision related to the policy, what the rules state is that you're not able to see it in preparation for a decision has to be in play for the materials to be provided to the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An example of that is last year we approved a sales tax agreement with a particular business to give them a half cent sales tax reduction. The Council would be provided all of that information in closed session in advance and you would get all the details.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's more about the ten year plan of how we target in order, because we're not able to see the order in which people perform under the current statute. They can only show us groups of information.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I guess we've had conversations, you and I, about being more creative about our sales.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I am fully supportive of that. However, it's the approach here that I feel is not it? It's the approach is not I'm not going to use the C word that council member Austin used, but I think there's a there are perceptions here of motives that could be there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then secondly, I don't know that we can't get there without taking this approach. So my suggestion, my recommendation would be to you that you rethink your approach and in a way that's more transparent and open so that I can participate and be supportive of you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because in this from this standpoint, I don't know how I can be supportive, but I want to. So I would ask that, you know, you revisit or you take a second look at your approach and look at a way that other council members can be participatory, maybe your full economic and F committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That may be correct. You know, just that would be my suggestion. And that's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I actually learned a lot tonight, more so than I thought I knew about this item. And so what I'd like to do is a couple of things. I have a couple of questions and just wanted to make a few comments.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I completely understand where Councilmember Mongo is trying to take our city. I do agree that she has a particular expertize that I personally don't have. And and so I place a lot of trust in that skillset and in that expertize.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I do recognize that there is a danger in the fact that. Different human beings hold our respective positions. And so when you create a policy decision such as this, it may have down the road an implication based on who who serving as chair of and F.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so in that regard, that part is very understandable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What I'd like to do actually, I do have questions about confidentiality and Mr. City manager or city attorney who currently has access to this information now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Earlier?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, currently, our consult in right now is Muni Services and they have access to it and then the city manager and any inner city auditor and any employees that they designate. So that includes a handful of staffers in the financial management department, including myself.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And in terms of confidentiality, how is that handled? I heard the city attorney earlier indicate that there are state laws that prescribe how exactly this must be handled. And so anyone else that may add it be added to this list, short list would have to follow that same process, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. We'd have to amend the current resolutions that control this to add additional persons or groups of persons, and they would be required to adhere to the state law that prevents them from disclosing information that comes into their possession in the course of their duties.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. So when I think about why I support moving in this direction, I think I'm looking at long range planning. Each of us have an interest in long range planning for the city. When we looked at the mayor's recommendation in this last budget, if we recall, the recommendation was to change Mr. Conway's position.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He's held somewhat of an economic development role, but we made a dramatic shift to his position with very admirable goals toward economic development. We also require, require, but certainly the people of Long Beach expect the mayor and and that team to focus on economic development and doing so.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Not that we're doing it blindly, but we are doing it on some suppositions and guesses and market trends. But there's very detailed information that perhaps could be valuable to the individuals that are charged with economic development. We each have economic development tasks as well within our districts and also citywide.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so that's where that's how I view where my support is for this item. But in recognizing the concerns that are raised, the very valid concerns that are raised, whether it's about transparency, who should have this information if one elected has it, should all electeds have it?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the larger question is, could we get to where exactly council member Mongo is suggesting we need to go with the availability of some basic information in some other way without compromising the confidentiality aspect. If it's the wrong person sitting in her seat, which down the road it might be, we don't know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We hope not. But I see that. And so for that reason, I'd like to ask my colleagues to support a substitute substitute motion to send this to the Economic Development and Finance Committee, to ask that committee to work with the city staff, come up with a plan, not necessarily according to what this motion says, but come up'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with a plan to get to the goals of and the intention behind this, which is to be able to strengthen certain individuals in the very jobs that we give them to perform economic development tasks. I would like our mayor to have a greater ability to walk into rooms where industry is represented and have a better idea, rather'",
        "'speaker_10': 'than someone simply immediately whispering in his ear that we're bleeding this much in this area and this much in that area, but a little bit more of a thoughtful metrics, set of metrics that he can use for long range planning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Same thing for Mr. Conway and anyone else that has the job of economic development in the city. Otherwise, I feel as though we are setting certain individuals up to perform at a certain level, but really not not providing them all that they need.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I think we can get there in a different way. That protects transparency, which we all want, and that protects us from violating any aspect of state law. And we don't have to be the first city to do something different.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I do believe in the merits of this motion, and I urge you to support sending it to E.D.. And f.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I second that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's been a motion in a second to send the issue to E.D. enough to work with staff to come up with some solutions around the topics being discussed by by the Council. Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to say thank you, councilmember mongo. I know this is I can I also see now after speaking with everybody the intent but it would be good to have a more mindful process having two very prominent business districts in my in my district, the west side and also downtown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we do need to be more thoughtful, more transparent. And also sending this back to the the committee would be, you know, certainly certainly a good thing. So I'm supportive of that as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. As the soccer mom who happens to be on the Economic Development Committee and my kids kids are here to to validate that I that I am actually a soccer mom. I will say that I am very much looking forward to the next four years and serving on the Economic Development and Finance Committee, because I do'",
        "'speaker_8': 'think that we are going to be doing things very differently and looking outside the box in terms of some solutions to enhance our economic development opportunities for businesses both in the city and those that we want to attract to this city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've talked with Councilmember Mongo, and I want to thank she and Vice Mayor Lowenthal for putting this item on the agenda and bringing it to our attention. I do not quarrel whatsoever with the intent behind it. My concerns are really the same as those that have been echoed by my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do. I'm very sensitive to proprietary information being disclosed or made available to staff members who aren't legally authorized to have it. I know that I rely a lot on my council staff to assist me and advise me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And although I believe they are the, you know, the best staff members out there and I trust them wholeheartedly, I think it's really important that we understand the nature of this confidential information, especially to, you know, a lot of businesses who have competent competition out there and want to make sure that this information is safeguarded.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other the other thing that I want to point out is, you know, we have we have staff that are specialized and we pay them to be experts and specialists in this area. We pay a lot of money in the city of Long Beach for our staff to advise us about these kinds of things if they are'",
        "'speaker_8': 'not doing that. That's an issue and a discussion that we need to have. If they need and I'm not saying that they're not doing that. And I'm not saying that this this item per se highlights that that's not happening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what I'm saying is I rely on our staff a lot to advise us, and I trust their opinion and I trust their analysis. And so I guess I would want to know from our staff whether or not they think.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One of the council members having access to this information would help the city in some way. Is that information that they think a council member having would would assist them in the advice and the direction that they provide in terms of their staff reports?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I don't know if that's a question that can be answered by staff. I know I. I think it's an important question for us to think about whether now or later when it comes back to committee. But I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. West, what are your thoughts on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, as I said earlier, we're supportive of this. I did point out already I spoke that I just wanted to make it clear where we stand with the other cities in California. Councilmember Monga has been very, very close, working with Mike Conaway and Lia Erickson to move an economic development agenda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we certainly stand ready to, you know, to work with our council in moving agendas forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I guess I'm the soccer dad on the council. I didn't hear anything about me. But anyway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So listen, I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Your passion for economic development. Councilmember Mongo. I think you're right to head down the path of asking questions like this. So, you know, I think this discussion is healthy, it is good. It's helping us realign. From an economic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're becoming more proactive. The fact is, we've been reactive the last eight years because of the budget crisis, the recession. So now is the mayor's plan with regard to the economic development is kind of being presented and and others participate, too.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you've participated you've been very clear that this is one of your key issues. So I thank you for that. And I think it's a very good thing. Again, as we become more proactive, these discussions are good. And I think really what's happened here tonight is a reflection of us not having a plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm not going to fault anyone for that because, again, we've been reactive, not proactive, just because we've been in crisis mode and we're now emerging. So, again, I appreciate the fact we're going to send this over to a committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you've heard my concerns. They remain my concerns. But again, I appreciate your concern that we have a more economic development in this city and focus on I think this conversation tonight will help us do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Can't remember your ringa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mary. This discussion, I think, raises the the whole issues that we've had during this last election year. And that was the the the the exiting of economics of of economic development, its and the need for the city to recover those funds or to at least track them a little better than we have been doing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It raises that whole issue. And I really want to commend the committee for putting this together and putting it forward for us, because it it raises a flag as to where we what we need to do in order to re position the city in a in a stronger place economically.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that when we're looking at the reestablishment of an economic development bureau or creating something else very similar to that is part of what we're talking about here, necessarily changing ordinances at this point or combining them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not sure that we're there yet at this point. I think we need to have a little bit more of a about planning strategy as to how we want to position the city economically and get in a good place where it needs to be, where it needs to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just had one thing as we were talking about, you know, if knowledge is power and those with the knowledge have the power, I want to be empowered and I don't have the knowledge. So give it to me, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And just for clarification, as we look at this council dais, we have people of all backgrounds and anybody and everybody in this city has the opportunity to serve. My my comments regarding a soccer mom hopefully weren't taken out of context too much.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I love my soccer moms. I love my soccer dads.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We just didn't grow up on that myself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It was just to try to bring home the point that that somebody could get elected. They may they may not have the background in terms of budget and finance to be able to truly sit in with our staff and strategize about how to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do want to and I do will support this going to committee to get marinated and and thought out a little bit better before it's brought back. I will support that that motion. The substitute substitute council member or Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I will also recommend that we we engage and bring in the the the state entity that is actually charged with with actually doing that. And that's the board of equalization because if there's leakage in sales, tax dollars and Long Beach, trust me, the state of California has an interest in it as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so they have the resources, they have the staff, they have the expertize as well, I believe, to help us identify that. And then if it's to the point, to the tune of 18, $20 million, that's pretty significant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I commend you, Councilmember Mongo, for bringing this forward. Like I said, I think this is an innovative thought. This was a necessary conversation. And I support the substitute substitute. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So I'm going to support the substitute substitute. And my question for Councilmember Mongo. So you're good with going back to the committee and then bringing it back here to have a discussion about some options that staff can an approach forward, a pathway forward that staff can can do without the extra information.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because that's what I understand is the as the motion. Are you okay with that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I am. I feel that there's there's two components. One, it's important to not delay a day in recruiting businesses to Long Beach and supporting the businesses we have. And while I appreciate the opportunity to go to committee, one of the challenges we will have is we will still not be able to know some of the information needed'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to craft the policy for this board to consider. Because of the way I read and I've heard that the ordinance is sorry for my cough drop, I've been sick for two days the way that the ordinance is written.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'While I would have interpreted it to say that they can provide information to city staff as necessary. I'd be interested to hear the city attorney's perspective on giving us that as necessary as we are employees of the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the committee would then, as necessary be able to see certain parts of this, to be able to craft an educated motion. I think that's the biggest challenge is the. To write a policy. You got to know what you're writing a policy about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're not allowed to see what's in it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I get it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's what I'm. I'm just.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I get it. And that's why I wanted to. I mean, I get the substitute. I'm going to support it. My question was, is that what you need in order to get where you need to go? Come up with an educated motion for the full council to come back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the other part of it is, how long is it going to take you to to do that? I think there's you know, there's interest. We've heard it tonight. All the council members are interested in this issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. And I don't want this and I've used it before. I'm going to use it again. I don't want this to end up in the land of loss legislation. This is something that I want to be involved with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So how long would it take you? And again, I'm waiting. This is the way I would engage the city manager at some point. How long would it take you to get back to get back to the city council with some recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would first ask our city attorney, since the ordinance says that information would be available to city employees to make certain decisions. Would this be one of them for us through committee members to be able to see that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And while you think about that, in case you need do you need a minute to think or do you know the answer? You got it. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But Councilwoman Mongo, I guess what I would the way I would answer it is we would commit to work with the financial management department on a case by case basis to see precisely what information you are looking for, because there may very well be some information that could be shared under the current.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's actually a resolution ordinance that this city has. And if we feel that it is violative of that ordinance and would put our financial management folks in jeopardy of violating the law, we would, of course, tell you that as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's the best answer that I have tonight, because without seeing the precise questions, kind of difficult to answer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then just to say points earlier today, I mentioned that sales tax for the city is approximately 60 million a year. I don't remember the number stated, but it's actually 58, which makes our leakage at 24%, which is a scary, scary thing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the final thing is if anyone does violate the law. It's not a misdemeanor. This is a serious crime. A serious. Felony that you could be put in jail for the federal prison. So I know there's this question of if someone bad was in the seat, well, you'd be able to quickly get rid of that person'",
        "'speaker_6': 'because they would go to federal prison.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So my question, how much time do you think you need to get back to the council?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like us to address this at the October meeting of the E.D. and if.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, you think you can be back within 60 days to the full council? Sure. So would you like to include that in your motion?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I certainly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Would. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think it's been answered. Councilmember Richardson had a series of questions about timing. I should have included that in the motion, but that's if you can take that up at the next E.D. and F and the direction to the substitute, the directions of staff is to also make recommendations on how to accomplish the goals that Councilmember Mungo'",
        "'speaker_10': 'has so has articulated so well, how to accomplish those and what options we have to do that. And certainly there's the option that was brought forward by way of motion today. But then there are other options. I think we can we can definitely consider that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's that's the charge to staff with with the motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because that's the motion on the floor. Councilmember to have anything else on that? Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just want to point of clarification. I know that we are looking at a substitute substitute motion. I've heard an exchange back and forth, but I'm very still very much concerned with the the who who's who's going to be entitled to information.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've heard that one person that was the original motion. And now I'm hearing that potentially a three member committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to question my long thought is the maker of the subject substitutes. I'm going to let her answer that and then we're going to move into a vote pretty soon.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if I might clarify, the substitute substitute motion is to refer the item to the E.D. and F committee, in addition to ask staff to bring forward to the E.D. and have committee recommendations on how to accomplish the goals of this particular item, and those stated by Councilmember Mungo, chair of E.D., and asked how to accomplish those'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with different options and bring that back to council within 60 days after the October meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for that clarification. Thank you. Before we go to we're going to get to a public comment. I just want to say that this has actually been, I think, a very instructive discussion for the council. And I actually want to thank Councilwoman Mongeau for really think outside the box.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was a really good conversation to have and I think an important one for the council to have as well. And so I want to thank her. And I think she she, you know, proved immediately why I appointed a chair of the back of that committee, because I think that's the type.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is exactly why there's experts of all types of backgrounds on this council, because we all everyone brings a different expertize on a variety of issues. So I want to thank you for that and without any public comment on the item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'KC None. Members, please go and cast your votes on the substitute. Substitute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Motion carries nine votes. Yes.'",
