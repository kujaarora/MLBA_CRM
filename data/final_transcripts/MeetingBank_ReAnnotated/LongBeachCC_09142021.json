So if you'll remember, on March 10th, the city attorney, Charlie Parkin, published a memo outlining the legal issues and questions associated with the transfer of Pier.'",

And five often a lack of appropriate ventilation with sides and the areas above all covered and thus decreasing air ventilation when it is most needed during this COVID time.

For me, I'll just say very simply know I think parklets are a privilege and how do we make sure that we're assessing Parklets appropriately so that people are to maintain that privilege?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My personal opinion as a resident is I don't think all parklets are created equal. I think some parklets are doing very well. I think some of the businesses in the show are doing very well with those parklets and I support that.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And then constantly going outside asking people to please stop smoking pot. It's coming into my house, so I have to police that. There's nobody who's controlling their crowd for some reason. The third parklet they feel the the parking lot is their bathroom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My kids are looking over the wall, watering plants. There's somebody staring at me. Is there pain on the wall? Like, how do I there they tell me. The restaurant tells me, not my property. So who manages the people that come out of their restaurant so that we can have a safe place for our kids?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've been there over 20 years, many iterations, and it's the restaurant owners need to take responsibility for the privilege they have of having a parklet. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And a lot of speakers, Jimmy. Mr. Mayor, City Council. My name is Tubular Diseases. I'm the owner of George's Greek Cafe in Belmont Shore. Let's see again. I've been a friend of his in a while.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm supportive of the amendment to it. I was going to say something else when I stepped up here, but after listening to other residents, you know, it seems like there's a couple of bad players on the street and it's affecting the rest of us that are operating our businesses in our restaurants, in our parks correctly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's why I really support the amendment. I've been a long time Long Beach resident. I went to Wilson High School. You know, the parking issue has been recently not as bad it has been in the past. I remember coming up from Wilson High School in 1980 as a sophomore in high school and going to us, we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'didn't have the park six blocks away to get to three. So the parking issue has always been there. It's kind of something you accept to anticipate for sure. Mr. Mayor, you and I are friends. We haven't always seen eye to eye on everything, but still friends.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you jumped into action and help with the parklets, it saved us having to compete so closely to Orange County. You have you coming up with the parklets and putting the barriers up for us. It saved our business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not even an exaggeration. We are not out of this yet. The people aren't on. The money we got from the federal government was helpful and we're grateful for it. But we're still in this thing. So I'm, I'm in support of Parklets for sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm also am in support of policing it and making sure that the residents don't feel about us as they do. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor Council. My name is Nikki Claire. I'm from George's Great Cafe and my sister. We've been in the community a long time. I live in the Hietala very close by. I agree with everything that everybody said. I do think that this isn't a parklet issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do think that it needs to be manned. But they have saved our business. We are at a premium for outside. Business right now. If we don't have the parklets, we have two tables. A lot of people still don't want to sit inside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is still a COVID issue. We would do anything that you asked us to to keep these parklets to make it safe for the residents, for our customers. But this is what's keeping our business open right now. Yes, we have deliveries in to go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People still want to get out and they want to sit outside. I still have tables inside that people will not sit down and eat out because they're not comfortable. And so I agree with the amendment to a point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we can manage it differently, manage it differently, we need to be able to compete with other restaurants in the nearby areas, especially across the way, which is half a mile or so a mile from Orange County. And so I'm that's all I have to say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. In the last speaker, Rebecca.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. Honorable mayors and members of the City Council. My name is Rebecca and I am a co-owner of Let's Joke About It. It's a breakfast spot on Second Street. I also want to second where Jimmy said, I am appalled to hear that the residents have been suffering and I would in no way ever support that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I encourage my staff to ride their bikes. I've bought bikes for some of my staff members and I walk to work even though I live in the neighborhood and I'll drive sometimes. But the parklet has saved my business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The pandemic is not over. If it is over or if we're heading towards over in, our masks come off and everybody feels comfortable. Absolutely. I don't want the Parklet indefinitely to inconvenience our residents. I completely support our residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and that's pretty much all I have to say. If I didn't have the parklet, I wouldn't have the business that I have today. My business was very empty inside this morning and I had about a 15 minute wait for the parklet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's truth. And I'm also keeping my tables six feet apart when a lot of the parklets have jampacked them in other parts of the city. I'm I'm trying to be compliant. So thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. That concludes public comment. I do have a motion and a second customers in the House.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You, Mayor, and I do really appreciate the amendment of the motion. And this temporary parklets were done in a time of distress for us here. And I really want to thank city staff our council for really stepping up and trying to be creative and thinking outside of the box to be able to save some of our businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We weren't able to save all of our businesses, and that's still hurt and it'll continue to hurt our city. But I think that one of the things that we did that we did do right was, you know, spring into action by creating these opportunities for our businesses to be able to offer a safe environment where they could'",
        "'speaker_1': 'also save their business. And, you know, I'm very supportive of this item, and I think that we definitely need to remain, you know, extend the parklets. With with also taking into consideration that we need to look at certain parklets and evaluate if it's working and if it's not and trying to help our businesses move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yes, we're still not out of this pandemic yet. So we really need to make sure that we continue to look for creative opportunities to continue to save our businesses while at the same time providing goods for our residents as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think what's happening here is we're in a transition. And, you know, we all wear face masks and, you know, address the public. The reality is we don't know how long COVID 19 is going to be here in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have to transition to create more resilient communities, more resilient businesses. We have to do what we know works. We know eating outside works. We know masks work. We know the vaccination works. We know that a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also know that the restaurants have taken a significant, significant hit. We don't get you know, our services are based on a certain mix of revenues in the city. Police officers, firefighters, the services people depend on are directly connected to whether restaurants can operate and generate sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whether we can generate transit occupancy tax in our hotels, it's connected. And so we have to figure out how to be more resilient cities. At the same time, you know, I think what the city manager is proposing, whether it's Second Street or any corridor, we have to make sure that we prioritize those local residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, zone in on what the issues are and work out a management plan to resolve some of those issues. And I think that's what the city manager is proposing with his men in motion to take a look at this particular corridor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would say any quarter that has significant concerns that race to that level, there should be a process in place and whatever moves forward for local residents to be able to appeal and have a formal due process to explore.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in general, I think we have to pivot. We have to start thinking differently about current management, about the sidewalk, the public realm, about restaurants, all of that if we're going to be a more resilient city. So I think what's in front of me, I'm happy to support today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to start by thanking staff on this item. They've been working, starting from the top with our city manager to our public works team. They've been working with me almost daily on this issue for about two weeks now to come up with the amendment that was shared a moment ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I and I so appreciate you doing that. As I indicated in May and I will do so again. Now, there are certain business corridors in the city that are similarly situated, given their proximity to homes, businesses and homes, though I'm not sure is one of those areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the only business corridor that has numerous homes consistently within just a few feet of residents of businesses. And so the impacts are felt at a much deeper level. And so I appreciate the amendments that were proposed today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those amendments include the feedback that I have received from the community, as well as the experience that my team has had in monitoring the the PARKLETS since they initiated. I want to also think that we have 21 comments on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know my council colleagues get that comment live. That's a really significant number of comments to be submitted on one particular agenda item. So I want to thank residents who were not able to be here who who sent in their E comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank the residents who came out to the meeting tonight and our businesses. I have had the opportunity to speak with almost all of you during the past year, year and a half on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope that you feel that some of the amendments that were put into place tonight by my staff through the recommendation address, the very things you've asked me to work on, and those are things we're going to work on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were one of the first cities to offer this opportunity to local businesses when the COVID pandemic hit. And I was a strong supporter of the Open Streets Initiative from day one. I am sure that countless businesses and individuals that this program has helped keep from seeing significantly worse financial situations and possible bankruptcy are extremely grateful for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this opportunity. I am a business owner on Second Street, so I have a vantage point that's very different than all of my council colleagues in that the COVID pandemic hit me and my family in a very personal way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we understand the need to have helped our local economy in the best way that we could, and I hope to continue to do so. We're in a very different situation today than we were when we first implemented this program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the biggest things that we're seeing now is that we have many more people that are back to work, meaning the streets that were vacant for so long during the beginning of the pandemic are now being filled again with cars and commuters who are commuting daily and impacting the traffic volumes on the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're also seeing, obviously, that there are major parking impacts as a result of some of the parklets going into place. And that has resulted in a lot of retail businesses reaching out to us, letting us know that people are not wanting to go shop on Second Street because of the need to look for parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's something that we're constantly aware of. We do, I think, need to reevaluate some of the parklets on Second Street. Some of them are no longer used or not used as frequently. And so we need to go through a process of talking to those business owners and finding out whether they want to continue their parklet or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not. We've had some business owners reach out to us and say they don't want to continue their parklets and we respect that will accommodate that. We also need to talk with adjacent business owners to find out if there is any encroachment, if they're still okay with that encroachment or not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a conversation that some businesses have asked us to initiate as well, and so we will do that as part of this extension amendment that was being passed today. I do believe it's very, very important for our residents to have an appeal process because there isn't a one particular location that that really needs to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been a huge quality of life impact for residents, and the residents need to have a mechanism to address that, and we need to think about whether we can move some of the parklets off of the side streets when they're in very close proximity to homes and figure out a way to get them onto Second Street if'",
        "'speaker_1': ', in fact, we are going to allow that extension. So this amendment by the staff allows us to take a look at all of those different options and be able to come up with a plan in December that is a little bit more streamlined for the businesses that are here that have been operating without any problem and no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'complaints. I want to thank you for being responsive and for for allowing I'm so glad you're here, because you get to hear directly from the residents what my team and I hear from the residents all the time. So I know that my time is up and I need to to let other council colleagues speak.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to end with just a huge thank you to Lisa West from my team. She's our business liaison and she has talked with every single person in this room. Numerous times our team was out there helping lay out the trails on the days that they were delivered.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've been very hands on on this process. And I just want to say that we couldn't have done any of it without her. And I just really want to appreciate everyone who's here, especially staff, for helping us come up with this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will host a community meeting. We will widely broadcast that meeting and encourage residents to attend, and that will be the start of a conversation for permanent parklets and other conversations that we need to have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you again, Catwoman entrepreneur. Thank you. And thanks to all the speakers tonight and thank you to staff for a great presentation. My comments run aligned with the vice mayors and that is well, Second Street might be unique.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It might be the only all encompassing location for this. But unless the traffic engineers tell me otherwise, it's not the only spot in Long Beach that has an issue with the PARKLET. And so I get a little nervous when we do a carve out for a district and there seems to be no path for any other districts'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I heard Director Marconi correctly that if there's a a process for someone with an issue on a parklet, I think he said that has to be based on the original parameters of how that that parklet was set up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It can't be a new amendment to the Parklet. And I'm sorry, I don't remember the lighting exactly, but do you know what I'm talking about? I'm not sure, but I'll try and address that. And you let me know if I got you or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The. There is people can already file complaints about Parklets. We're going to formalize that process so that perhaps it would look like a dedicated telephone number and email address where people can file their complaint. Staff will go investigate that complaint and identify whether or not the business is complying with the requirements of the permit for the temporary'",
        "'speaker_0': 'parklet. If they are not, then we can take action. Okay. And so what I would like to see is some latitude in there because it might have been set up with all great intentions, but that doesn't leave any margin for what if something changed or would have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'COVID has changed a little bit. And I'm just wondering if we can get something in there to where a protest could be lessened or could be submitted based on a new circumstance, not on the original set up of the parklet, if that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that makes sense. And I think that that's reasonable. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just wanna thank everyone who came out today, and I especially want to thank the councilwoman as a regular on Second Street and a person who has a lot of friends that live walking distance. And we love to meet at their house and walk down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I've seen both sides of it and I've heard both sides of it. And even residents who live nearby still enjoy walking down to Second Street and enjoying it. So I applaud the councilwoman for her efforts on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she always works really hard to make sure that everyone's heard and we can come to a resolution that I think if we get there, this could be a solution that could work for the whole city because Parklets have changed and there are some value and there's a lot of interesting opportunities district citywide, but each of us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have different unique things that our district. So I'm going to stay tuned. Thank you, everyone, for coming out tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank everyone. Please cast your votes for the men in motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The question is, hey.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We're not going to do. A series of items, none of which have any public comment lined up, and there's no staff presentations on any of these. So we're going to kind of go through these quickly. Madam Cook, I am 27.'"

Thanks to the attorney who spoke to it pretty well last week. Brown Act is important. There are additional steps that we can take here locally to make sure that we we sort of protect our and'",

And so the importance of the Brown Act, obviously, we know it's about public, you know, ensuring that discussions are held in public. And so I wanted to carry forward the recommendation from the city attorney to add that additional provision so we don't step over the three into 4 to 5 by'",
        "'speaker_0': 'by establishing a council policy that sets the max number of offers on an item to three here in the city. And so, that said, I'm happy to make this motion. Councilman Allen. They can't.'",

If we're really trying to avoid browner interactions here, I'm going to make a substitute motion, and that is that we set a new policy that we have no one signing on to items other than the original maker of the motion, and that would avoid any'",
        "'speaker_0': 'gamesmanship or whatever, and it would absolutely eliminate any browner considerations. And this would be just a regular applied to just regular agenda items and not to supplemental supplementals. We would still use the old rules. Is there a second on that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or is there a second on that? Of that in that second bit Councilmember Austin that that is the current substitute motion come to anyone go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That's given me something to think about because I wasn't aware that there would be a substitute. I think that the first step is knowing and understanding the rules. And I know that we've been committees and different things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Different things have changed. And I think that staff having good intention is important. I'm open to either option. I guess I just want all of us to. Bring forward items. That support the community in a timely manner that supports making good work get done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lots of different bodies have lots of different ways of doing it. I think that staff could bring back those for us because I'm open to. Whatever's best to get the people's work done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Cancel or bust me, Richardson. Thanks. And I can appreciate the councilmembers Hooper knows of subs through motion. I think the distinction is there is a certain level of collaboration and that's okay. What we're doing is adding a protection ensure that we don't spill over to four and five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So encouraging council offices up to three to collaborate across district lines is a good thing. And I think removing one signer won't stifle that collaboration. So in the spirit of both adding, you know, this recommendation in alignment with the city attorney and preserving some level of collaboration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I support the main motion form. I'm going to vote no on the substitute motion to support the main motion. Councilman Austin. So I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amendment just in the spirit of hearing hearing it out and I believe it, there's a merit here. This is the Brown Act is very, very delicate. And I think, again, we all in good faith try to do our very best to collaborate, also follow the law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, a week ago there were there were some procedural errors or that was brought to light. It may have not been the first time. It was the first time it had probably been brought to the light.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do appreciate the city attorney for the correction and also my colleagues for that and thinking that that. That issue. Listen, the it's one thing, if things are a collaboration, you're damned if you do, but you're damned if you don't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is one area that I'd like to see a little bit more emphasis on this. The. Because we can go to other processes, we can go to other types of votes or both in the process and how we can pay for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have to get a majority of vote. You telling me that you don't talk to. Majority of people to get to that number of votes on that process. I think, you know, BROWN That is a slippery slope. And we as the council members have to talk to one another to get things done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm going to withdraw my second on that because I do think collaboration is very, very important. But I will tell you that moving forward, I will bring forth items on my own if necessary, in the spirit of trying to get things done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But at the same time, again, we try to work together and talk to our colleagues and engage folks and bring people on board. There's that that that uneasiness each and every one of us I think most of us have full time employment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And if we're not here, we're not engaged. We're communicating through electronic devices and sometimes over the phone and through intermediaries. That is part of what it takes to move an agenda item and to move policy on the body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I want to be very clear that I like the idea of bringing an item of items forward on your own. But there's a risk that you do so that, you know, you might be out there on your own.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the the city manager's recommendation of three refiners maximum is a safe safeguard. I'm going to vote for the policy, but I don't think we need a policy because war is allowable. That correct. Mr. Turnbull. Sorry. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member. That is correct. For Islam. So quick question to the item before us. If someone were to violate the policy and speak to four people, what would be the consequence? The consequence is it is to exactly what you said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's the policy of the council. And there have been other situations where the council has not followed their policy. The consequence could be a a decision by the council not to either hear the item or. But there is no legal consequence to that as long as it falls within the Brown Act.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like to make a suggestion if you pass this policy that you give it a clear direction not to accept items that have four people on it by accident so that its the rules are clear how you want us to handle that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you submit an item that accidentally has four people on or rather than three. I appreciate that clarification. So those are my comments. Thank you. Thank you, Captain America. Mayor. Sorry. May I just. Point of order. The second has been considered, so the second has been pulled.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there another second? If there isn't another second, we go back to the main motion. Is that right? Should attorney. Think so? Okay. Country Ranga. Thank you. Simply stated, a city councilmember can always something. And I don't know that we're going back to the main motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's very Ranga. Yeah, like I said, a city councilmember can always have an item on his own at any time, regardless of whether we have Brown Act or not. The the. The motion on the floor is basically just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is a cautionary, a cautionary item, too, to give us an indication that if we are looking at more than three people, that that will the city quick will be alerted to it and will let us know what you got for people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You may want to put it back to three. That's it. And it's a precautionary item to just give us notice that. We're on the edge of a brown at issue that we submitted before. That's all that is. It's not to say that we can't still violate the Brown Act by contacting Border Point councilmembers in our effort to'",

Comment customers without comment is that we're always available to everyone. But one thing that that's important, I think, is the fact that our meeting here on the day is is about relationships'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And our relationships are sometimes based on items that we present forward to ensure that we at least vet whatever item we're putting forward so that we know that the discussion is going to be taking place in a in a manner that is going to be either supportive or that brings up questions about why they are with you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the first place. And I think that's very important to our relationships. Other the days and I would say counsel that we share our thoughts. We share our ideas. We comment on them. And we think we will go forward either with three or four individuals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the Senate would have no more than three. And I support the original motion for a couple among them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Last week's discussion brought forward a lot of learning, and I guess one of my colleagues mentioned collaboration and how agenda items bring forward to collaboration. I appreciate the rule that we have put upon ourselves in the past, led by Council Member Super, not in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate the restructuring of our committees that the mayor took part in earlier this year really facilitated for us. I mean, I would love to see more of that collaboration happen at the committee level. I really think that that's an opportunity where three people are supposed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm really dove into the context of all the other policies that have similar subject to really grow and have the access to the staff members to help flesh out those ideas in a more casual discussion. I also got a call that I thought was a very interesting one where a member stated many years ago the State Assembly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and State Senate were not made up of people who had moved from city council level up to. Or moved on to. I shouldn't say because it depends on what region you're in, but moves on to Assembly or Senate positions for the first time in several generations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are more previously. Council members serving at the State Assembly than never before during our time on this Council, and that the laws related to Brown Act were written, from my understanding now by the State Assembly and Senate, who chose not to have those laws apply to themselves because they felt that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to say how they felt, but there's a lot of discussion that was you can watch on television about the reasoning behind that. And so it's a very interesting topic.

        "'speaker_1': 'And when they don't sign on to the item, it doesn't even give us the opportunity where if one of them signs off later that you know and understand who is a part of that.

        "'speaker_0': 'But what I'm hearing just in the last couple of comments is the value of people collaborating. But the city attorney's idea diminishes that. So we're taking away one person from that. So we're kind of working both sides of that argument there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm not sure if I have a second now, but that was the spirit of it. I like the city attorney's idea. I was just looking to improve upon it a little bit. Thank you. Thank you. Council members.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. Without violating the.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'During the meeting to talk, that's a brown ass violation if you're not one of the four people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I mean, the issue is you're having a conversation about a subject matter coming before the body with a majority of the council. Yes, that's a serial meeting and it would be a Brownback violation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I agree. And that has been my interpretation. But in the past, I think I've had folks have maybe interpreted it differently and said unless it's at that behind the diocese, it's not really ripe for discussion. Blah, blah, blah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But anyway, if there's four people on an item, you can't talk to them. You can't. Try to come up with compromise positions, etc. If you weren't asked to sign on, you're not part of that conversation until it's at the door.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Let's hear from community stakeholders on why this facility is so vital for our community. Well, the importance of health equity is basically trying to assure that the entire community has a standard of health. The problem that we've encountered over the over the years is that many parts of our community have been left out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Traditionally, we've had neighborhoods that have been severely impacted by environmental factors, and the families that live in those areas suffer more. And so there needs to be more advocacy and more resources in those areas to fight those inequities of having a healthy environment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If the community is healthy, that can be a healthy workforce or a healthy student base. Then that leads to people who are alert. People are hungry to learn and people who are motivated to do better for themselves. And I think health equity is the essence of that type of success.'",

The workforce development will be co-located at the site to provide workforce opportunities for people reentering out of incarcerated settings as well as for as for youth. So we really we've launched a number of other different programs and all of those will be offered there as well'",
        "'speaker_4': '. This is important to North Long Beach because it allows access more freely to people who live in that area. They don't have to worry about barriers such as transportation. They are in a familiar neighborhood where they feel comfortable maybe going back and forth for many reasons, and they can build relationships with the staff there.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Item 19 This report from Development Services Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing. Declare ordinances amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by creating enhanced density bonus to facilitate the development of mixed income. Multi-family Housing An ordinance related to impact fee waivers for affordable moderate income units.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to introduce our planning manager, Patricia Defender for who will be making the presentation for this public hearing. Good evening, mayor. Vice mayor, council members. This is Patricia Defender, her bureau manager. The item before you is the proposed enhanced anti-business ordinance, which aims to facilitate facilitate production of both market rate and affordable housing throughout the city'",
        "'speaker_1': '. It involves a zoning code amendment to add a new section of the code section 1268 and amends other sections of the code, as we'll discuss later in the presentation. So density bonus. This law is not a new law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The State first adopted the density bonus law in 1979. The law essentially requires cities to offer density bonuses and other incentives or waivers from zoning regulations to facilitate housing production and to help offset the cost of including a percentage of affordable housing units in privately developed market rate housing projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The density bonus law has been in place for more than 40 years to help address the affordable housing shortage. The amendment in early this year the state law was amended and it went into effect to increase density bonuses from 35% to 50%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Among other changes to the law. And this is in recognition of the fact that the bonuses and incentives were really not sufficient to support housing production. So in the next couple of slides, which is going to describe very quickly what the enhanced anti bonus ordinance does and why we need it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the bonus that the ordinance offers bonuses and incentives that are above and beyond the state law. They are, however, tailored to the local conditions, and we'll discuss that a little bit more further in the presentation. The proposed ordinance complements the inclusionary housing ordinance that was adopted by council earlier this year in a couple of ways.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, it helps offset the costs for providing affordable housing where the inclusionary requirement is mandatory. And then it also offers a voluntary inclusionary program for those areas where the mandatory requirement was not found to be feasible. Some things that the ordinance does not do is it does not rezone properties or change the property's land use designation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It does not up zoned any low density or one or two zoned areas, and it does not allow residential uses in areas that are planned or zoned solely for commercial use. The proposed ordinance is needed to encourage housing and particularly market rate and affordable housing, and to make it feasible in more parts of the city to ensure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'an equitable distribution of housing in the city. As we've noted, the state density bonus has not been sufficient to encourage housing production in the city. It has been used only in very limited instances in the past couple of decades, and usually by projects that are already proposing 100% affordable housing, providing the greater density, bonuses and incentives are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'needed to encourage the production of the housing. And this is intended to be. Importantly, this is intended to be a temporary measure to help achieve the city's upcoming housing element cycle. Rina goal of 26,000 housing units. It is intended to expire by 2030 or whenever the city reaches the affordable housing target of the Rina, whichever might come'",
        "'speaker_1': 'first. So in trying to sort of convey why this strategy is an important strategy, I just wanted to share that the staff has conducted a number of different studies that have shown that the development is infeasible in many areas of the city, even those areas that were planned for housing and mixed use development in the UAE.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So analysis and study conducted, for example, through the planned North Long Beach planning process revealed that because of high land costs and high costs of construction and physical site constraints like small or shallow lots, many sites cannot be developed to the anticipated densities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These market analysis also showed that projects are infeasible and can't pencil out unless costs can be reduced by almost 40%. And that reducing costs by 20% brings densely bounded scenarios within the realm of feasibility. The study also shows that reducing parking by nearly 20% would make density bonus scenarios feasible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So these studies do reinforce the need for these tailored regulations. Okay. So the proposed enhanced anti bonus ordinance is consistent with the adopted city policies to increase housing production and affordable housing, specifically the revenue to have an incentive for production and affordable housing study that was adopted by the Council in May of 2017 and the Everyone Home'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Plan. It also implements the land use element of affordable housing policies. So just in trying to explain the applicability of this proposed ordinance, not all properties in the city are eligible for the enhanced density bonus bonus incentives. Only those properties where the zoning or the place type allows five or more units without bonuses are eligible for the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'enhanced density bonus. And again, just to reiterate, it does not rezone properties to allow five or more units, but rather five or more units as an eligibility criteria. This map shows illustrates the areas where projects are more likely to be eligible for the enhanced density bonus based on the place type.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's a little bit hard to see on the map that you can see that the hatched areas on the map are the areas where projects or sites are likely can be eligible. And those areas tend to be in midtown, downtown and some of the major corridor corridors that were already planned for multifamily and mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Multi-family and mixed use. Those areas are anticipated that their use is anticipated in those areas by the land use element. And the land use element does serve as a blueprint for the enhanced sensiblement. So just to reiterate that the areas shown, for example, in yellow that are the lower density single family areas are would not are not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hatched and would not likely be affected by the ordnance. So this not just ties that the geographic the city was divided into three sort of tiers for purposes of flying bonuses. The bonuses the greatest bonuses are limited to the areas that are most accessible to transit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So most of the city falls, a lot of the city falls within the base area, which has a maximum bonus density bonus of 70%. There's areas that are along major bus corridors where there are frequent bus service are eligible for 90% bonuses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then the airline transit stops, major transit stops and areas where two major bus lines intersect. Are eligible for 100% bonuses. And that's kind of how the that ordinance would apply. And this helps address other goals, such as reducing vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This map shows the transit priorities areas which are defined by state law, and it sort of ties back to those three geographic areas. So you can see the areas in the white on this map are generally the base areas, the areas in the green, but outside of the circles are the high quality transit areas, that mid level'",
        "'speaker_1': 'tier. And then the areas within the green circles are the black circles are the highest density bonus areas. And again, it's important to remember that despite the proximity transit, it says if a site is low density and does not allow for five or more units, it would not be eligible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a table that shows very quickly compares kind of the state density bonus and the affordability, the percentage of affordable units that would be required to compare state with the proposed ordinance and the three different geographic tiers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you can see the different maximum bonuses and the amount of affordable housing that would be required as a result. In this slide, I would just want to sort of demonstrate how the bonuses and the affordability requirement work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this example is a site that would be located in that mid-tier that here with a bonus maximum is 90% and it's a high quality transit corridor area. So if you look at this example on this site where the zoning would allow 36 units, 36 is the base units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you take 15, if the project wants to have an 80% density bonus, it will have to do a 15% affordable, very low income housing requirement. So that would mean the projects ultimately would have six units, which is the 15% of the 36, and then it would be allowed to have a maximum of 65 units, 29 additional'",
        "'speaker_1': 'units from the bonus, 23 of which would be market rate, and six of which would be very low. That project would also be eligible for some concessions and seven concessions, which I'll explain here. So projects that provide affordable units as a component of a market rate project are eligible for a maximum of nine concessions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The concessions ordinance proposes concessions in sort of two different kinds of concessions on menu concessions, which are by. Right. Relief from zoning regulations that are zoning regulations that are customarily projects need some relief from such as floor area increases or reductions in open space or setbacks, individual setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's also off menu concessions, which are things that a project might not might need relief from that are not on the menu. And those concessions, if requested, they count as two concessions for each request and it does require approval by the Planning Commission and specifically wanted to tie the mentioned height.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Height is a by right concession as is required by state law and the enhance that the proposed enhanced density bonus ordinance would allow a maximum height incentive of two stories in the base area and three stories in the transit priority area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additional height beyond seas. By right height concessions would be considered off menu concessions and inclusionary projects are also entitled to concessions that they are limited to a maximum of six concessions. And finally, there are some extra concessions and bonuses for projects that provide onsite childcare and large family units as a way to encourage those kinds of developments'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So the this slide just shows the parking reductions that projects are eligible for. As mentioned before, a state already requires or requires cities to grant parking reductions for projects that include affordable housing. The table on the left shows the ratios as required by state law, and the table on the right shows the ratios that would be required'",
        "'speaker_1': 'under the enhanced density bonus. It's basically it depending on the location of the project. A project may obtain more reductions from one or the other of the options that state law does allow for a reduction of up to a allows one half of a space per unit for projects that are within transit a priority areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So areas closest or projects closest to transit would probably obtain greater reductions from the street the state than the reductions and projects can choose, depending on which side of reductions are most advantageous for the project. So this slide just tries to explain the differences between the two parking scenarios, the two the state versus the proposed enhanced density'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bonus. In this example that we use from previously, if this were in the base area, essentially 36 units are allowed by the zoning. If the density bonus is 60% and 12% of the units are very low income, then this is what the parking requirements would be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you can see based on the state parking requirements, it would be 82 and with the enhanced the proposed enhanced density bonus, the parking would be 69 parking spaces. But conversely, if there is a project that's proposed in a major transit stop area with these kind of parameters, 44 based units using an 80% density bonus because it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is within the half mile of the transit is the state law would give you a point five spaces per unit. So in this example, the state law offers greater reductions 40 spaces compared to the enhanced NC bonus 89 parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So another important aspect of the ordinance is the no net loss requirement. The no net loss requirements of the enhanced density bonus ordinance ensures that both that there is no loss in total units and that there is a net increase in affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it requires the projects have to provide to both replace any existing affordable units that might be on the ground. In addition to providing a percentage of affordable units that's required in exchange for the density bonus. Affordability levels of any existing residential unit is determined by rent, by the rent level and the household income.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if either rent or income level meets affordable levels, then the units have to be replaced on a one for one basis. And this helps stabilize the number of naturally occurring affordable units in the city. So it's kind of just to wrap up and talk about some of the administrative provisions of this plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This proposed ordinance, as mentioned before, this ordinance with sunset has a sunset clause. It would sunset unless re adopted by the city council by October of 2030 or when housing, the affordable housing is not at the arena. The review process for these projects would be site plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Review projects would be reviewed for design and compliance with objective design and development standards, including the urban design standards and transitional height requirements and projects with request for off menu. As I mentioned, off menu incentives would be reviewed by the Planning Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This ordinance, as proposed, also includes a amendment to the impact fee sections of the code to include a impact fee waiver for affordable units for moderate income units. It already allows for fee waivers for lower income units, and this would extend that to moderate income units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Public outreach on this ordinance, on this proposed ordinance was conducted in conjunction with the housing element, and there were a number of outreach meetings, focus groups, Virtual Open House has been available on the website. The staff did receive a number of different comments on the housing issues in general and the enhanced density bonus ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And specifically, they were definitely interested in strategies to increase housing production and to increase affordable production of affordable units. But there was also concern expressed about parking, about the quality of the housing, about impacts to infrastructure and those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A negative declaration was prepared as the environmental clearance for this ordinance was fully posted and noticed in accordance with figure that the California State Environmental Quality Laws, the EDB, does aim to help the city achieve the six cycle RINA allocation and that the ordinance is expected to just help achieve that and not to exceed the the number'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of units that was anticipated and planned for in the in the land use element. And individual projects ultimately do have to have their own environmental review. So with that, that concludes South presentation. And these are the recommendations essentially to adopt a number of ordinances that would amend the code to establish the enhanced density group bonus program to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'update site plan review findings accordingly and to update the. See sections of the code to extend the fee waiver to moderate income minutes and a resolution to submit the ordinance to the Coastal Commission in conformance with the Certified Local Coastal Program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That concludes that recommendation. We're happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. So I had an opportunity to talk with you about this presentation a bit. And I understand how this this density bonus program will complement the inclusionary housing ordinance. And when we adopted it, I remember we created two zone one in an area that already had a downtown midtown plan that has enhanced density bonus'",
        "'speaker_0': ', is already a part of that process. And then a second area that would allow inclusionary housing, which we supported on this council. If there were incentives, if there was a set of incentives equal to or connected to the ability to provide additional unit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you also told us, hey, we're going to create some of those incentives since the city doesn't have a dedicated source of local revenue to produce affordable housing. All of that makes sense to me bringing this forward. A couple a couple questions for me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think one. The obvious question is if you build more units in an area with less parking standards, what do we do about parking? And I understand that there's sort of three piers. There's your rail area, there's your high quality transit area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not real close enough. There's there's busses and other things and then there's your base area. So that's tier that makes sense to me. I also know and understand that as a part of our Climate Action Adaptation Plan, we're talking about parking strategies to address that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, here's what I'm curious about. We're going to need to create some sort of parking management program or policy or ordinance to complement any new buildings that take advantage of the density bonus. And even if people don't do that, I think we need to do that anyway because there's many other state laws and other things that ultimately'",
        "'speaker_0': 'reduce parking. We need to be thinking about parking management or transport transit, transportation management. What do we have in the works? And is there a way to tie those two together, tie these three things together? The Density Bonus Program with the greenery, housing, your climate action adaptation plan and a parking transit management ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My first question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson. So we the city is the department is working, as you know, on updating the zoning code as a part of the implementing the land use element and creating new zones that help to implement the newly adopted plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Part of the code amendments that are anticipated is updates to an existing transportation demand ordinance. So the city has in the zoning code a transportation demand management ordinance currently. That ordinance, the CAP Plan, the Climate Action Adaptation Plan, actually calls out as one of its actions action 87 to update that ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That ordinance applies right now generally to just commercial projects, and that has traditionally been how transportation demand ordinances have been applied. And there's an opportunity to look at extending some of those strategies that are used to housing projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So things like, you know, transit passes, having spaces on site for car share projects that are designed in such a way that they improve the pedestrian environment, they contribute to greater walkability, greater visibility through their design. Those are all different strategies that can be used to make sure that projects manage their transportation demands.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And and the idea, in my opinion, would be if we're building new development and they're taking advantage of these standard, if we want folks to be able to take advantage of transit or incentivize through passes and things like that, we also need to have an expectation that the people who live there in this new building will'",
        "'speaker_0': 'want to ride a bike or walk. So we need to make sure that the things that they need, that daily need, should be in a walk or bike distance from their home. So we need to evaluate if we are placing higher density in these communities where their relationship to their grocery store or their market.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What's the connection of bike share? And we make sure that our bikeshare programs, if we're adding them to these areas, that the infrastructure that we put in those areas intersects with where we're preparing for growth. I think another thing that we have to think about is and I've raised this before and I want to more formally ask'",
        "'speaker_0': 'you to look into this. We have three agencies setting policy on transportation. The city of Long Beach on your micromobility and your last mile. So Long Beach transit on the busses and metro on the train. Three policy bodies all setting policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Three different policy decisions to affect one outcome. And I personally believe that there needs to be an alignment one body, one decision making body in Long Beach that talks about transportation, access and equity, particularly as we're making this major shift as it relates to parking standards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so can we, as a part of moving forward, look into those two things that updating the transportation management program that was a part of the CAP implementation. We need to make it a part of this implementation and to exploring what a model would look like to create one agency or an agency but one alliance to discuss'",
        "'speaker_0': 'these issues across those three agencies. That's something we can do. We have the capacity, the bandwidth to do those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted to point out that certainly that helps align with CAP implementation as well. So the CAP calls for much stronger collaboration between the city, along with transit and Metro, recognizing the criticality of improving not only access to but information about and sort of door to door service related to public transit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So whether it's our bus stop improvements, the timing and frequency of service as well as the end user experience, we hear a lot about that as we do planning outreach. For example, with that plan, we heard a lot about that as well as during the cap development process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think this is a great opportunity to align those things because we know to help encourage the system change, we will need all of the players working together more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next, we have Councilwoman Toro and Vice Mayor. I also might add that we have a plan review process already built into the process that will allow us to look at each unique development and project and its location to be able to develop additional conditions to suit that project and the needs of the of those residents'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I think that's I think the great I think what I'm looking for, though, is like these ordinances are something like they're citywide. Right. And I think those relationships between these different policies need to be thought of from a system standpoint as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So from a system standpoint, how we engage with our transit agencies and we are now with Transportation Agency, since we're doing bike, we have to get down differently. And I think now is the time to make make sure we do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's something I would like to see happen tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With Vice Mayor. I think the staff for the presentation on enhanced density bonus ordinance, you know, I have a district that that definitely has a lot has really I think met its fair share of development in how in building affordable housing and appreciate exploring ways in where we could offer this in other areas so that, you know'",
        "'speaker_1': ', we're ensuring that we're meeting our housing needs. And so I agree with Vice Mayor Richardson around transportation concern. I do not have a metro line, also known as the blue line that runs through my district. That's an opportunity as well for further growth, which I look forward to exploring, to see how we can ensure that we take'",
        "'speaker_1': 'advantage of at least that transportation corridor. So what I support, I think, you know, offering that this enhanced density bonus ordinance and so that's why I wanted to share. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Forgive me, Councilman. Your anger. No disrespect to Councilmember Price, you know. Please excuse my frustration with this. Very nice, very colorful. Oh, probably. Okay. So when you have this chart here with all these nice colored bars inside.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Meaningless to me in regards to being able to interpret. What this is saying and how it impacts my area specifically. And well, I mean, it's not a requirement to be able to counsel. I think that there should be cognizant of the fact that you have a council member.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who is sensitive to that, to this. So I would appreciate it in the future if you can provide that kind of information in in a more. In a better way for me to be able to be able to understand it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would appreciate that that that is the that is me. What I think is important for you to know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I come from a very strong partnership, even different. We do have a version of the map that just shows in sort of one color the areas that are eligible based on place type. And I can make sure to get that map to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that very much. Not to be able to by discussion is that, you know, I certainly appreciate the effort both there from from the city to create this enhanced density bonus. But there's a conflict there because you're also saying that the state density bottleneck is not working.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So how does this address that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council Member Your other sources even differ so that that is precisely the reason for this proposed ordinance because the state density bonus has been in place for quite some time and we haven't seen the results. We haven't seen it produce the amount of housing and that that one would expect with a density bonus ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's because of what we talked about in that one slide about its terms. This is a proposal that's tailored to local conditions. It takes into account the local sort of market forces, the land costs locally and the need, you know, the amount of bonuses in terms of extra density and other concessions that projects actually need to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be financially feasible. And so this is why we believe that this particular set of regulations is going to be able to finally help generate the housing that density this was intended to generate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other count. Vice Mayor Richardson touched upon it in terms of like development that has. Close proximity to. Important businesses like grocery stores and retail stores or shopping areas. I know in my area I have a major corridor, Santa Fe, that goes from 10th Street all the way to downtown Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in that short period, that short stretch between TAB and Warrego, I have commercial residential areas and that's a corridor that nobody's going through and all that. So I think it would, I can't tell from this if it's included in there because I can't see it anyway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the things that I did a couple of months ago was that there was a development that was being proposed. I will. That would have helped. I would have met this, but at the same time did not provide any neighborhood serving services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's my concern is that. If we're doing these offering these bonuses to these developers. And there is no neighborhood serving serving element to it. I think it just basically. Doesn't provide any any benefit to the city because all it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It may help us. We are reliant on it, but it certainly doesn't help the the individuals who end up living in those houses because they're still going to have to get in a car or get in a bus or get in a bicycle and ride two or three miles somewhere to go to a bank or to get'",
        "'speaker_0': 'their groceries. So I don't see the benefit of that in that respect and not that I'm opposing. With taking place here. I just want to put that in your radar that a lot of these developments. Art while they may not be addressing parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're also not addressing neighborhoods or serving elements to the neighborhood as well. So I bring that out as a concern because I certainly have one in my in my area that brought up two months ago. And I think that also needs to be addressed that you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be around a capital city center for just want to point out that this ordinance we're aware of your concerns for your corridors Willow and Santa Fe in particular. And of course, the council adopted a moratorium to give the Planning Bureau and the Development Services Department time to develop new zones in any future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we are developing, apply those new zones. If there's a requirement for a mandatory minimum amount of commercial space, this density bonus would not change that. This bonus density bonus ordinance could work in concert with that to actually encourage redevelopment that would then be in the form of mixed use and would bring the desired neighborhood services to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the Bay Area. Right now there's just a lack of investment generally. There hasn't been new development in terms of either commercial or very much in the way of residential. And this may just provide the incentive that would entice a developer to build pardon me, develop a mixed use project and bring the commercial and the have the added'",
        "'speaker_1': 'benefit of bringing more residential units as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can use a keyword there. Mixed use. That's very important. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. So a couple of questions. I do have some concerns about this item, and I appreciate the presentation staff have provided and the briefing that you gave us in advance. But as proposed, I can't support this item, so I am going to share some of my concerns and ask for some amendment and hopefully'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those amendments are accepted. But if they're not, I'll propose them as a substitute. I think we can all agree that as a state we're in a housing crisis and we as a city need to do more to see more housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that I'll speak for myself personally, that we were able to, in our plan, provide a capacity for over 2000 units just in the third District. And so I'm very proud of the collaborative process that we undertook with our residents to get there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I want to mention that the land use element, I feel like we just passed that a couple of years ago and we have a lot of height limits on development included in the land use element. And now we're talking about a discussion of adding additional height and density.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It feels to me a little bit surprising since the land use element was supposed to get us that additional housing we needed through the next couple of decades. And when we invited residents to community meetings and we had those very heated discussions with residents, we shared with them that if they worked with us and they walked along'",
        "'speaker_1': 'side this process with us, we were going to develop the capacity that we needed to comply with our state mandate. And so I can understand how residents would feel unhappy or confused about this process and specifically this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can speak for the third district in particular. We had numerous community meetings and years, six years specifically of discussion on CCF before it was finally approved after years of plans. And then we had the value added involved, a lot of community involvement and we passed it after all of those efforts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And now to have heights just allowed to be increased without community involvement feels a little bit like a bait and switch for the residents. So I guess as a clarifying question, I just for the public, because I know the answer to this with this policy allow for buildings to be higher than what was approved by this council'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and both the elderly and the. Councilmember Patricia Defender heard this. This audience would potentially allow projects to exceed the height limits that were identified in the U.S. and insist within the limits that were described. And that would happen without public input.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We wouldn't have to go through an approval process. So, again, you know, state law does already allow a number of these incentives. The the process that I identified through the density bonus ordinance would involve site plan, review and projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right now, projects that are 50 units or more do have a site plan review by the Planning Commission. So those projects would involve a public hearing and sort of airing in a public setting, as would projects that, as we mentioned in the presentation, projects that would be taking advantage of any off menu bonuses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So those projects would go to planning commission, would have a public hearing. Projects under 50 units or projects that are 100% affordable. Currently, they are reviewed and approved by the Site Plan Review Committee. Okay. And I understand the state density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My concern is that we're going beyond that into specific areas that are of concern to me and I've heightened parking. Parking is also a major issue for residents all across the city. And it doesn't matter if they're close to a transit corridor or not, because at this stage, parking is important to the community and individual residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we continue to see, despite our mobility efforts, park parking always being a topic of conflict and frustration between residents and nearby businesses. So it's really concerning to me that we could see a density increase with no accommodation for parking needs in the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have a number of amendments. I don't know if I can do them in 44 seconds. So, Mr. Vice Mayor, can I put the amendments on the record now, or would you like me to to back up?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you should put them on now, and I think you should as foreman and substitute motion. Mine is just going to be a staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So I'm going to make a substitute motion. Then the substitute motion would be to take the staff recommendation. And make some modifications to concessions for height increases and parking as currently proposed. The proposed density bonus would allow up to two additional stories of height in the base area and up to three additional stories in the high'",
        "'speaker_1': 'quality transit corridor areas as on menu concessions. I'd like to propose that this be modified for the base and high quality transit corridor areas. Since I understand that allowances for the major transit stop areas can't be modified under state law, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the base tier area I am proposing we reduce height concessions so that only one story of additional height could still be allowed as an on menu concession. But under my proposed modification here, a second story would become an off menu concession that would then be required to go through a public review process, go before the Planning'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Commission and the project would be required to prove the additional height is a physical necessity for the project. This additional layer of public review would give the public greater opportunity to have a say, and the need to prove the additional height is a physical necessity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sets a higher bar of only allowing the height if it's the only way a project could work. I understand that off menu concessions also count double. So extra height would then be counted as to concession. Similarly, for the high quality transit corridor area I am proposing we reduce height concessions so that only one story of additional height'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be allowed as an on menu concession. But a second and or third story would become an off menu concession subject to the same additional requirements. I just described that it must undergo a public review process before the Planning Commission and prove it's a physical necessity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As to parking amendments, my substitute will include the staff recommendation with the following accommodation or change to bump up the parking ratios for 0 to 1 bedroom to be one space per unit instead of the 0.75 spaces per unit, and which is the same as the state density bonus law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm also proposing to bump up the parking ratio for two bedroom units to require them to provide 1.25 spaces per unit. I know the city has a dire shortage of larger units for families who may need four or more bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm comfortable providing a small amount of relief for larger units, which are in the greatest need in Long Beach, particularly for families. So I'm proposing the parking ratio be two spaces per unit for four plus bedroom, since this compromise would increase some of our parking ratios and make them the same as the state density bonus law'",
        "'speaker_1': '. The other modifications I'm proposing is to clarify that these revised parking ratios would be inclusive of guest parking, whereas the staff's recommendation listed parking separately. So again, this amendment would no longer call out guest parking as a separate requirement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Otherwise, as I understand it, we wouldn't be able to bump up the 0 to 1 bedroom ratios because legally we can't be more restrictive than state law. Do those amendments make sense to staff?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, they do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, thank you. So I will make a substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, gentlemen. Doctor. I would love to see that substituted in writing, and my comments would be very short. I think my my colleagues have really made some great comments. I do appreciate all of the work that our development services team has put into the document and have a density bonus ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it underscores. The importance of planning on the local government level. Right. I don't know how much time and effort that went into creating these documents and plan. I do want to know about the community engagement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you can you speak to what the type of community engagement went into this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Councilmember Austin, thank you. It's a different approach. So as I described in the slide, in one of the slides in the presentation, we did do the outreach staff did outreach for this project kind of concurrent with the Housing Element Update, which is being, as you know, updated right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had a number of workshops starting in August of last year, kind of during the height of the pandemic. We did virtual workshops. We had a Spanish speaking exclusively Spanish speaking workshop. We had focus groups with affordable housing advocates, the developers, both market rate and nonprofit business community to understand what are the the needs around housing and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what are from a development standpoint, what is needed to make housing production more feasible? We had meetings earlier this summer. We had a workshop about the housing element. Update In each of these meetings, we talked about the different implementation strategies and ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you know, Council has been acting on a number of different housing ordinances that are all part of a multipronged strategy to try to increase housing in the city and different types of housing. So that is in summary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's also been virtual the virtual open house that has been available to people. We've invited people to share their housing stories by video or voice message, and we're collecting all of those things. But that's been the way in which we've engaged the public on this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And my my colleague, I'm also the councilmember Price mentioned the land use element and the process that went into that and that this enhanced density bonus ordinance would layer on top of the land settlement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember It does follow that. Mandy Solomon 27, is the blueprint. And also I think it's important to mention I may not have covered it in the presentation, but the reason why this is also a temporary measure is that there's the city, it's going to take the city some time to develop the new zones and resound consistent with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that. And so this also offers a stopgap measure in this interim time while we're still developing and rezoning properties consistent with how you need to be able to take advantage of some of these density and height bonuses. But it does it can also layer on top of the value.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this particular ordinance, time sensitive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You mean the adoption of it is a time sensitive? Well, it is one of the ordinances that we have to demonstrate to the state that we have instituted policies and programs to achieve our RINA in this upcoming cycle, which is four times greater than the arena was in the past cycle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there are going to be in the future penalties to cities for not being able to achieve, you know, meet its targets. And so this is viewed as one of the many different strategies as part of the housing element in implementing the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think we mentioned this before, even during a housing element discussion. We have the plan. We have the plans on paper and an ordinance for a landing zone in possibly to add to it and have this important ordinance than necessarily mean that we are going to actually achieve those goals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's certainly going to help us get closer to achieving those housing goals because it's informed by, as I mentioned, the market studies that show all the ways in which projects really need to achieve reduction cost cost savings in order to be feasible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it is tailored to your point about, you know, some of the state legislation. This is tailored to the local context and is informed by what is needed in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'll make you up later. Council member. Suvarna Thank you and thank you for tonight's presentation to staff and thank you for the briefing. Two weeks ago. That was very helpful. Just have a couple of points that others have brought up to me or I forgot to ask during our briefing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just wanted to follow up on the statements about public outreach. Not all the staff was at the Whaley Park viewing meeting. I know Oscar Worthy was there. And Linda Tatum, it was like the Rose Bowl. It was the granddaddy of them all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't attend all of them, but I've never seen anything like it before or since. So to say there's public interest in this topic is an understatement. And so I really take seriously the ah comment to my colleagues about the need for public outreach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also on the transit question and this, residents have asked me and asked to speak to my district because we have a unique situation. We have Cal State, Long Beach on the east side of the district and the west side of the district is 90804 the most densely populated zip code in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach Transit is in the fourth District, their headquarters on Anaheim and Gardena. But on the east side of the district, we have it's just the volatile nature of what is provided. So we have a Cal State, Long Beach shuttle bus service, which is on again, off again at times.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's gone all the way to Anaheim and Termina to pick up students. That system's gone now. Then there's a hybrid system where students are offered free bus passes on La Brea Transit that's taken place in the past, no longer around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my question is, if Long Beach Transit is a separate entity, Cal State Law, which is a separate entity, how in the world do we possibly lock in this public transportation element if we're going to build housing that is dependent on that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe that's rhetorical. Or if you have an answer, great. I love to hear it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well as it pertains to this ordinance. Council member, super or not, the State has defined what constitutes a high transit priority area or a major transit. Stop that map with the. If the if we can bring the presentation up, I could back up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can show it again. But the map that shows the green and and the circle. So that's largely defined by state law already in those areas already meet the threshold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think maybe I maybe I'm not posing the question correctly. So that enables you to get the let's say, the bonus and then say that goes away. We may have gotten the bonus and whatnot, but now we we have a problem now to get people from point A to point B because the service has gone away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that that's my point. Maybe I'll just leave it at that. And I think that well, I guess I'll just say I'm prepared to support the substitute motion on the floor and and just also want to say that the the need for public outreach on this is is very strong.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. And they are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. They smear. As you all know, I'm all for affordable housing or any housing. And we are in a crisis. And so producing housing is definitely very important to me. I know that, you know, I can appreciate the intent of this item and all the hard work that has been put into it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that being able to produce more housing is essential in our in our city. But I also in hearing a lot of my residents right now with the existing construction that's been going on with, you know, this last year and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And parking seems to consistently be an issue. It is consistently something that my residents struggle with. So I you know, that's that's something that that's very important. And when it comes to density, I know that what we're trying to do is make sure that we can attract those those developers that can that do have the ability and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can produce housing with affordable housing inside of them. And I do appreciate that. But I think that we definitely need to look at the parking situation as we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Couple. Couple. Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I appreciate the meetings and support and data that has been provided by our team. Excellent work. I also understand that certain parts of the cities have really produced a lot of the housing numbers. And I guess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If they keep changing the goal line, it's not really fair to cities. I mean, if the real number is now four times what it was before, it's going to be really difficult for us to meet that. But there are dozens of cities throughout the state and Southern California region specifically, which have made almost no effort to support'",
        "'speaker_1': 'any of it. So we're doing our part and we're going above and beyond even further. So I'll support the substitute motion on the floor. And I guess I would just say that. When I said on calls, I said on a call last week with a bunch of developers and real estate people, and the discussion was really about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the amount of housing that's going into construction in 2022. And there are several other barriers besides policies. There's workforce barriers, there's resource barriers in terms of even lumber finally come back down a bit. But the cost of steel and lots of other things, it can't only be burdened on the backs of the communities to make up the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'difference. Inflation is not helping. And we'd love to help, but we need to see a collaborative, regional approach. And I think the moderate changes that Councilman Price has proposed are fair, equitable. And I will reiterate the same of Councilmember Sabrina.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Community input on each and every one of these is critical because the transit lines constantly change and they're not coordinated. And until there's a method and a pathway forward that gives every resident the ability to go to and from their resident to a home or educational facility and transition into a job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And quite frankly. Remember Richardson and I've talked about this, the restructuring of the tax structure in the state of California to incentivize cities for us to really bring the jobs to the people. I mean, there's just so many factors that really need to be coming together.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'But the arena requirement, you get 20 years. I mean, you get nine years to implement in our land use element, you get 20. So it's the arena standard is, you know, it cuts it in half. And the reality is we're going to have to have some enhancement, but we're also doing a lot more than a lot of'",

Overreaching tactics by certain groups in attempt to gain attention, influence and intimidate. Public officials there and other high profile individuals.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I serve on regional boards and I've, you know, come home and there's signs on all the just my neighbor's yard. And my neighbors have complained. People have knocked on their door about the pressure me to vote one way or the other on on a regional board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, I can think of other incidences where, you know, folks were in my front yard, I'm up in my garage and my driveway. In each case, I approached them. I approached the folks outside. And I know there's a different comfort level there, but I approached them outside, met them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I asked them, you know, hey, my neighbor has a newborn or I have a finger to live here. I'm here, put the bullhorn down to stop. And after that, I hadn't had that incident again. And with the folks, you know, the regional board, I sat down with them and and my chief of staff sat down with them'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And so that's the sanctuary we have. We do have to protect. Now, I do want to I do want to ask about the the enforceability of this. That is something that should should go up. And I also want to ask, Councilman, often what I what I would actually feel I'm going to support what you do here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think the appropriate thing to do is the like before we tell them the draft ordinance, have them look into these different issues to make sure what ordinance does go forward. We have a plan to enforce, make sure there's enforceability so we don't project, you know, an impact on a neighbor or a police officer or whoever'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is going to do the enforcement. I do want to actually hear about feasibility before we actually vote on the actual ordinance. So just a couple of things that, you know that I think we need to think through. So, Mr. Modica, could you speak to or Chief, could you speak to the enforceability question so I can have the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chief talked to you about that a little bit? I will say it'll be situation dependent for sure. Whenever there are protests. That is a heightened environment. You have people who are very passionate and so there's a lot of things to consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also need to be thinking of the officers that we might be putting in that situation. And again, if it's a very small event, that's one thing. If it's hundreds and hundreds of protesters, that that's a different issue as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with the chief, add anything to that that he would want to. Good evening. My Vice Mayor and members of the City Council, Mr. Modica, hit some of the highlights. But typically when we're doing a protest management, which we do a lot of in this police department, our priority is facilitating First Amendment rights, and we're very successful'",
        "'speaker_0': 'at that. We do get these occasions where protesters will just disrespect people's property. Enforcement is typically one of the last things on our mind when we go there. We have contact employees who will make personal contact. Try and find out, Hey, what can we do to facilitate this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And 99% of the time it works. So there's just many steps we get to then enforcement. But as they always say, the devil's in the details. And as this draft, this ordinance is drafted, we will have some input and then we shall see where it goes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, obviously, other cities have done this and it does help because we have had protests and individuals homes and there has been some destruction of property. So we obviously want to prevent that, but we want to make sure that our community's voices are heard at the appropriate in the appropriate time, place and manner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certainly. Thank you. And I think that, you know, understanding you're going to look at some of those things that that's a good thing. So let's go ahead and hear from the rest of the council councilmember Yolanda. All you see right off the top.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am not supportive of this motion. I believe in the right of individuals to protest. There was a protest at my house over the 22 years that I've been an elected official, I've had several with our trustee as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Controversial issues came up to me then and there were protests. The you know, I'm in the belief that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I mean, it's as we've had a protest recently, I think the police department did a phenomenal job in having those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that putting the. As a as an audience basically would tie their hands a little more than that then I think it should be. And it puts more restrictions on their ability to address protest, even at residences.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So basically I'm just saying that I think this ordinance might be in the spirit of protecting. The welfare of elected officials or the subjects of any kind of protest. I think that the people have a right to do so, and we know that when we get into this this job, that that is a very much a possibility'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ciro.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. So I. I do believe that we should. People should exercise their First Amendment. But at the same time, I don't think there is a boundary as well. And where, you know, it's it goes to the area of where it becomes, you know, violating property, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think, you know, and other areas that can be very scary. So I'm interested also in adding to what vice mayor is saying is in addition to feasibility, I'm also interested of what have other cities done. I think I just heard that the city of L.A. did pass a similar and then they also had a $1,000 fine'",
        "'speaker_1': 'per person. But I had a lot of questions like how do you how do you go about enforcing that? And then also, what does how does that prohibit them from disturbing your neighbor in order to pressure you to cave in to what the protesters are asking for?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So so that's kind of where I have questions about it and would like to learn more about how does it allow people to still exercise their First Amendment, but at the same time, how do we ensure this isn't adding a layer of challenges to police officers and how to, I think, manage this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So that's where I would like to see is what other have other cities done it and is it working as well in addition to the feasibility of it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, gentlemen. Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. The protests that I've experienced started at another residence in my community that that was not an elected official and it was an appointed official. And I think that when I watched that unfold and. And the commanders here now who he's no longer a commander.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, it was a a multi-week issue that was very, very destructive, not only to the neighbor being targeted, who their agency gave them options to move, but the neighbors around them did not have those options. The neighbor who was being protested was warned and notified in advance and potentially moved to a hotel room or moved to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'another regional office for a short term. They had a lot of options. It's the neighbors adjacent to the protests subject that have had the hardest time. And I appreciate the commander at the time. We went out and did community meetings and we talked about people's right to protest and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It can be frustrating for the neighbors who. Know their neighbor as their friend and their neighbor and somewhere where their kids play at the neighbor's house. And now it's become this this target residence where there was vandalism. There was all sorts of really bad things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the challenge surrounding protests and the way that they occur and sometimes the spontaneity, but less often now with social media and the ability to find out about them is just the. The quick evolution and risk to the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like Councilmember Richardson, I've gone out and spoken with protesters in front of my house. I've had lots of great conversations. Cova didn't always give that kind of opportunity, both at council and in front of our homes, to have that because of the need to create space and all of those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I will say that. The people who lived adjacent were the ones who are most impacted. I signed up for this, but my next door neighbors did not. And. The House is on. Both sides of me have sold since I've been a resident in this neighborhood, since I've been elected, I should say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that's been pretty hard to have those conversations and help them understand. One has grandchildren that live with them and the other has two children that live with them. And and they are afraid and they are concerned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're very interested in this because. They don't have the de-escalation options that maybe the council member has to go out and talk to the individuals. And sometimes you don't even know the protest is coming and you're not home to be able to go out and support or de-escalate and discuss with the residents and hear them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm open to supporting this tonight. I don't know what the solution is. I really think that a survey of those most impacted that didn't sign up for this are really the the concerns and the hurt my heart the most.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To hear the the the frustration in a grandparent's voice when they didn't know that they bought a house next to a council member was a really hard thing for me. I know that people talk about the most disruptive thing as living next to a neighbor with a barking dog.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think my neighbors would argue that the most difficult thing is living next to a council member for the various reasons. And I would say that during an election cycle, the poor neighbors have been targeted with. Candidate to turn them in for not pulling their their trash cans away or turn them in for other violations that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are typical in a normal neighborhood and occasionally forget. And then all of a sudden they have a notice on their door because some candidate was targeting me but accidentally got them. And those have been said this for me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm I signed up for this and I'm happy to to meet with any resident, any time, any place. Sometimes I've reached out to a residence I wasn't able to get a hold of. And and they don't even want to meet with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's okay, too, because that's their right. But I just wish that our neighbors that live adjacent to us on each side weren't as impacted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Thank you. I do appreciate the, the, uh, the question the, uh, the critical thought going into this, this, uh, this particular item, the spirit of this item is to again, promote safety and peace, sanctuary at home for evidence, support, quality of life and neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, there there is a template template that has been in place and I believe the city of San Jose for well over 20 years now, since 1993, it held up to the Supreme Court as well. Here is a template, and what this item does is establish parameters, he said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it should do is give that. Hyper aggressive individual who who may be thinking about doing harm to someone's property, then maybe thinking about flipping fear and intimidation. When someone's property, we give them pause to think about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there's a fine process, I totally support that. But when we talk about enforceability, I mean, I think we can talk about the possibility of every ordinance that we pass. I can name probably a dozen of them off the top of my head that are never enforced.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like fireworks. Okay, so terminal. Let's just go on and on. The the the work of of policy making doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be perfect policy, but the spirit and intent of policy to sometimes persuade or dissuade behavior.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so some of the examples that we've seen that people who put moving vans in front of people's homes with the derogatory messages on them. That fear of intimidation that brings terror to a household, to a neighborhood. We've seen people show up at people's front door.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the wee hours of the morning, we've seen firearms brandished the danger. So I think we have a responsibility here and an opportunity here. And, you know, this is not something I'm going to necessarily die on the sword over because, you know, yes, I've had people protest in front of my home.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, I'm a public official. I knew that this was a. The job came with certain certain responsibilities and vulnerabilities. At the same time, you know, we have to say enough is enough. Some of us were privileged to see the president yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We saw him behavior after that. That should be very concerning, right? Very concerning. Today, being a public official, being a high profile individual is not the same as it was five years ago, not even two years ago. It's a different, different climate and I think we have a responsibility to address it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council. Excellent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for mentioning that. Councilman Austin, I did want to share a couple of things. The first is one of the I have I get completely what Councilman Aranda saying. And for the record, I have. I did sign up for this job and all that it comes with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And unfortunately, good or bad, my personality is such that I say what's on my mind, which means that, you know, I'm going to have people come to my home. I'm okay with that. But I don't know that that's fair to my neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when I say things like, I'm not going to change my position on this, or I do support our patrol officers on the streets, and if that means you need to come back, then come back. It's not fair to my residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So one of the protests at our house that Commander O'Dowd is familiar with. I had a resident who does not generally support my politics or the politics of this state. I was standing outside his house two doors down with a loaded shotgun, and Commander O'Dowd can attest to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He was standing outside during a protest with a loaded shotgun. Those situations really scare me because between his house and my house is the house with the family, with a seven year old and a one year old who do try to leave when we have advance notice of the protests because of the language that's used on the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'speakers that are generally placed on the on the street. So it's not it's not about me or what I like or what I don't like. In fact, my family, you know, my husband goes out there and, you know, records the protests and, you know, they're they're not certainly not shying away from it, but it's really not fair'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to our our neighbors. So the point about last night, the thing that concerns me is my mother, she's 74 years old. Many of you know her. She's had some health challenges in the past. I would say she's not in fighting weight right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She's not at the at the height of her physical abilities. And last night, she got in a face to face altercation with one of the protesters about some comments that they were making about Afghanistan and federal policies. And when you're in that heat of that moment, you get emotional.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't think it was my mom's intent to get it in the face of a very aggressive protester last night. But they were saying things coming from a war torn country ignited some passions in her. So she said something back and it literally took somebody trying to separate them because there was no metal detectors for the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'protesters that were there last night. No one knows what they had on them. And yet here's a 73 year old woman who sane and has her mental faculties about her, who was not able to resist that moment to speak the truth, which she felt needed to be spoken.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that happens a lot more when it's in front of people's homes because they feel like you're now in for a my home saying things that I may or may not agree with. So I feel comfortable to come out and challenge you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's just a recipe for disaster. That's the problem. It's not us. I get what Councilman Ranga is saying. I completely agree with him. It's not us. It's. It's the people around us who didn't really sign up for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and I think the ordinance, which was just passed by L.A., was done because we're in a time now where things have been stretched to a limit that could potentially be dangerous. And I think we're just trying to protect the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate Councilman Austin bringing this item forward, and I appreciate my colleagues supporting him, not just for those of us here who have experienced it, but for the many residents who live alongside us who don't deserve it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was on furlough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So I definitely appreciate this robust conversation. And I'm and then I want to maybe offer a friendly given my question I had is, you know, wanting to learn a little bit more about the feasibility of it and what other cities done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do appreciate Councilman Austin sharing that. San Jose's done it. Love to learn more about it. And also maybe just the cost that it might be additional to do that. I don't I don't know either. So if I can offer a friendly that, we do a little bit of a study to understand it a little bit more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then come back. With that information so we could decide from there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What do you propose we study?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To understand the impact of how do we enforce it, how does it work and have other city done it? What are their challenges so that we can make so that we can create an informed ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That the city attorney. Can you can you look at that while drafting the ordinance? May. Yes, we could certainly work with staff and come back with an ordinance. And I think we could work with staff on some on a memo or a document that would hopefully get some of the answers to the questions that have been raised'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I don't have the answers for you this evening, but we could do that at the same time. But that would require us to make some assumptions on what you would like with the ordinance. However, it'll come back and we could certainly revise it in any manner you deemed appropriate at the first reading.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with that said, I'm happy to accept that a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Current supernova. Thank you. I would like to possibly shed some light on this last item. The friendly. I just. I just want to clarify. This idea of this might impact this will be not enforceable or or whatever. I'm not sure where we're going with this, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilman Austin, thank you for bringing this forward. And you had mentioned the moving vans with messages on them. Actually, the moving vans represented what I believe the police thought was this was meant to look like a Timothy McVeigh exploding, moving van in Oklahoma City.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was the threat combined with that. And this was last Thanksgiving. One of the organizers posted his photo online, holding displaying an assault rifle. They went online and invited. I think our best account was 26,000 people to visit the council houses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So while everyone was enjoying Thanksgiving, I was on a conference call with my council colleagues and Commander O'Dowd and I and I know Commander Herzog was very involved last Thanksgiving. So there's a tremendous impact on whether or not we have this ordinance in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But one of the things that struck me that probably wouldn't strike others is that my father was a first responder, and we spent a number of Thanksgiving without our dad at the table. And to think that these protesters caused police command staff to miss time with their families over this, I don't know what the protest was about'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I'm not sure. But I think they didn't want us to shut down restaurants for COVID. I think that was the whole point. But it was overkill, to say the least. And yeah, I did not have my family at my house by Thanksgiving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to dispel the myth that with this ordinance in place, we'll have all these additional police resources to try to enforce this. I think we have a bigger problem if we don't do it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right, so it seems. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to add on that, that the vans were parked outside of our homes for three solid days. At first we didn't know what was in the van, but then we figured out they were open in the back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My husband wanted to put some of our goodwill donations back there because we have no other way to take them. But capital among us was locked. But that visual was a reminder to the whole neighborhood for three full days that we didn't know what was coming on Thanksgiving Day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that kind of terror on a neighborhood is just not fair, especially when you knew 26,000 people were invited. Thankfully, four showed up and it was uneventful. But the point is that for three days, the residents knew this was on social media and did not know what to expect on Thanksgiving Day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't know that our police department worked any less hard because we didn't have an ordinance. I don't know that an ordinance would impact on what they did or how they would do it, but I think an ordinance would set some appropriate boundaries for neighborhood activities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Just reflect on the entire conversation. I'm glad to see that there's been some amendments here to have a study, you know, feasibility of some of the issues. You know, show us tell us what other cities have done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The menu of options that we've heard enough from enough of the members that, you know, we want to do something here. We don't make make sure it strikes the right chord. We protect we support First Amendment right. We want to make sure that that is loud and clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are not calling protesters, protesters terrorists. We are not doing that. However, we do want to make sure that we are doing what we can to protect the safety of not only our leaders, our neighbors, anyone who is a target of these activities which have ramped up over time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. Right? Right. So so the idea is safety. But we do want to send a clear message. And so we want to be nuanced. We want to see that feasibility report. And I want to see it before we vote on this thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're not putting that as a criteria. We're giving you direction to create your ordinance. But we want to see some of those things so we can be informed on what those menu of options are when we do cast that vote on that ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we should be very, very clear. We protect First Amendment rights. We want to make sure we have the right attempt to have the right ordinance. We see what those amendment mean, those menu options are. And then we make a thoughtful case here on how we do this and that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's really what what I like to make sure that we see that said in any public comment on this item.'",

Recommendation to send a letter to the city's federal legislative delegation advocating for safety resources in the federal infrastructure package to include funding for local jurisdictions related to traffic enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Gonzales comes with a price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's okay. Thank you. This item came out of committee. We did have a presentation by Dr. Tyler Curley regarding some of the federal legislative proposed federal registration dollars and the focus on traffic safety. Unfortunately, the the federal discussions and the proposed drafts of the legislation don't include enforcement by the police in the area of traffic safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I would like, through this motion to request city staff to draft a letter to our federal delegation asking that there be some flexibility to use some of those federal traffic safety moneys for proactive traffic enforcement, for DUI and speed contests and other speeding violations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our traffic unit at the Long Beach Police Department has been has been reduced by virtue of our budgetary constraints and needs. And my concern about that is that the reduction of the traffic safety, the traffic unit of the Long Beach Police Department has made it more difficult for us to conduct some of the proactive enforcement that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'need. I realize traffic safety is not the sexiest of issues, but if you have ever known anyone whose life has been impacted by a drunk driver, whose life or the life of their family members has been tragically ended by a drunk driver, then it will be a priority issue for you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As it is for me, I have dedicated over 20 years of my life to supporting victims of crime, many of whom lost a loved one as a result of an impaired driver or a driver that was speeding or engaged in a speed contest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that we need to have a stronger and. More proactive traffic enforcement team on Long Beach PD. And I'm hoping that some of the federal infrastructure dollars will allow us to build our traffic team back up to allow for more drug recognition experts to be on the Long Beach Police Department, to allow for more directed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'enforcement teams to do traffic enforcement on our major corridors and to be out there conducting not just enforcement, but outreach, education and warnings about speeds, about impairment and about all those things that really impact traffic safety for our community in addition to traffic design, road design and engineering that we already are focused on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'd ask my colleagues to please support this item because the infrastructure dollars can be utilized for things outside of what is currently listed and contemplated to include personnel and traffic enforcement efforts by cities through their police department.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm grateful to serve on this committee and very supportive of the item and throughout my time with the council. And actually one of the reasons I ran for city council is because of a traffic light. And I will tell you that the safety of our streets has been a consistent priority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have tried to use whatever resources become available to our district for flashing crosswalks, studies on lights, trying to make it safer for pedestrians. A majority of the pedestrians that are really moving through our community at certain times of the day are youth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And quite frankly, since COVID, I will say that the speeding, the severity of DUIs and the distracted drivers across our city are completely out of control. And we've had several vehicles run into houses. We've had several vehicles hit pedestrians.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And some have been fatal and have really rocked the heart of our district. And. I recognize that you can't have a cop on every corner, every day. But we need more enforcement. And I'll continue to work with the city staff to come up with design changes that really protect residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're talking about major boulders being put in front of houses that have been hit multiple times. And we've had cinder block walls just completely annihilated and people are just driving too fast. They're already violating the law. So there's no more laws you can pass, just a lack of disregard for their peers and children and the number of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'signs that I've seen. Put up, please slow down. Children's play here consistently goes up because the erratic, speeding and distracted drivers are just at a new level that the I. I have not seen in my lifetime. And it's very disappointing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't know another way around it. I've I've heard the study is that enforcement only impacts a resident who gets either the ticket or the fine or the whatever for a short period of time. But at least for that short period of time, the residents are safe from that driver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I will I will take a moment just to thank our former commander who's here, who on several occasions when we would report the erratic driver, he would make a personal call to either the family or the parents of the individual who were speeding or erratic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it's just not enough. And we need more. And I'm very supportive of this item and thankful to serve on this committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to just just add some comments and a friendly amendment here. So I think all of this certainly makes sense. And I'm glad that the committee took this up, and I think it's a worthwhile request.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also know that we epithet led committee are organizing requests in alignment with our request for this infrastructure bill. For example, you know, this is one request, but also there's no local dollars in general within this infrastructure bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's, you know, there's federal, you know, roads and things like that. But we do want to have a local infrastructure program, which I think is really important. We certainly want to do groundbreaking ribbon cuttings on streets, but we want to do groundbreaking and ribbon cuttings and other critical infrastructure important to our communities, you know, community centers, schools'",
        "'speaker_0': ', whatever it is as well. And so I want to make sure that we're speaking with one voice. And so I'll ask that that this go and be a part of the, you know, whatever overall message that we're sending as the sort of route to get there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So whatever that looks like, I know that we're going to have another committee meeting in the next month. I know that in Tyler, Dr. Crowley, we anticipate that bill to move like October-November, is that correct? Yes, sir. We will likely have more details on the reconciliation package this month, but it may take through the end of fall'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or this year to remove both of those packages. Right. And there may be other things that come up between now. And is that okay with you to make sure we speak one voice?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I. No problem with accepting that as amendment I just timeliness is an issue. And so when this committee was formed, the mayor specifically said to me, I want you guys to take up the federal legislation that's coming out for infrastructure and so that we're just trying to move on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've had four meetings now, right? So we're trying to move on it. I just I just don't want to delay. But I think speaking with one voice as a council is always really, really important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good. So, so right. So I think working on the bill is good, you know, giving feedback. But at the end of the day, you know, we're going to speak to one voice of the city. So, you know, I think you I think you've accepted it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think we're we're good in that place. Couple of mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just. What are you asking for? There not to be an immediacy of the letter that the items rejecting or requesting the items requesting a letter. To the federal delegation. So are you asking that we hold the letter until after the Federal Legislative Committee?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that a question? The motion belongs to Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman? I mean, yeah, I guess I just don't. I don't know when the next committee meeting is. I, I just want them to know that this is a priority for us as soon as possible. Now, I want the letter to come immediately.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then how long does a letter usually take when it's possible to put the letter? I know that's. I don't know. When's the next Fed meeting? I guess that would help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think we I don't have the date in front of me, but I know that you've been working with time has been working with Matthew. We've had a consistent meeting. We've talked about we just got past the last reconciliation bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we're working on infrastructure and the idea that there's going to be a convergence of all the issues that work together. And we certainly plan on, you know, I mean, from you know, we've I think we invited a number of members to actually speak to the committee, federal members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've talked with, you know, Congressman Lowenthal, who we're doing that process. And so what I don't want to do is start having, you know, different messages come out from different places. We typically have that issue when we talk with like the port, for example, they may ask for a big request.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And sometimes we say, hey, let's make sure we ask those questions better. If you're talking to Army Corps of Engineers, for example, they may say the top priority is dredging, and you may say the top priority is to break water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so sometimes there needs to be sort of convergence of priorities, and that typically happens at a fitness committee and so on. So. So I think what I'm asking for is we speak one voice, we take this letter, whatever else is coming, we deal with it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, there'll be some immediate thing we're advocating today. We're still engaging today. But what I don't want to do is start sending from two committees, you know, shooting from two committees, no different priorities. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's why we brought it to council because this council were to vote on it. We would be speaking as a council. Not if I didn't reach out as the committee chair. I brought it to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you started that, you said you were you were bringing this forward from your committee when you opened up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. It came out of committee to the full council. So as chair, I didn't personally reach out to the federal delegation, because I believe it's appropriate for us, despite our relationships, to come to council and get direction from council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think we would still be speaking with one voice if we all, as the council, agreed that this was a priority. And unless I'm missing something, I don't know what the detriment would be to send a letter of support on behalf of the City of Long Beach for this item, and then send another letter of support'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for other items. I don't think that would be inconsistent, is what I'm saying. But if you'd like to include them together for whatever reason, I'm open to that too. I just this item is urgent, in my opinion, because I want to get it on the radar as they're discussing this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just I want that to be on their radar because it's not a priority item. It's not like the bridges are important. Traffic safety is not it's not that. It's just as you're talking about traffic safety, can we also include personnel dollars?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's all. So thank you. I don't know. That would be we would be inconsistent. And I'm I'm agreeable to anything. I just wanted to bring this forward so we can move it forward faster. And I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think we just go back and forth. You should just you what you want to speak of? Oh, I thought.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I still had the floor. You asked me to ask Councilman Price the person out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You deferred.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry you took most of my time. Can I recue? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I see the infrastructure committee as the mayor's instruction to lead on infrastructure. So, Councilman Price, this committee went over this. You had an excellent leadership on your committee to go through the discussion and really bring it forward in a meaningful way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am very supportive of this coming forward from this council. Now, if it passes with a majority vote, if there was a schedule I know an economic development committee, we set our meetings, we're sat on all of our meetings through February or March.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I recognize that certain committees have to pivot and move more in alignment with other agencies and other entities, and that's great. But I'm supportive of us having one voice as a council and voting on this tonight and that this letter would come out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So back to my original question to the staff. When the council typically passes a request for a letter to be sent to the delegation advocating for something, does that take a week? Does it take ten days? Does it take three months?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I usually takes about a week to ten days or so. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so you're still planning to move forward with that as the item on the floor stands? Is that accurate?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I understand the item. We would write the letter stating that the Council approved this motion on September 14. Wonderful work and additional resources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to make sure that that was still with whatever was going on with the friendlies. I just wasn't clear. And as the second term of the motion, I wanted to be clear. Thank you and still supportive of the item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay, so I'm just gonna say this. You know, we're seeing these committees. The one thing that resonates with me is if the mayor's asked the Infrastructure Port and Transport Transportation Committee to take a lead on infrastructure bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not my understanding. I know that he has to work on it, but that doesn't that didn't necessarily change from I respectfully when you just make my claim statement. So if that's if that's what the understanding is, I have to talk with the mayor and we'll figure it out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't have a problem with finding out if that's your operating understanding coming into this meeting. But I also know that we stood up at the beginning of this process when we changed our committee structure, we said, Hey, this is your lane.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are this is where we want you to focus. And if that's what we're going to focus, then let's commit to the committee structure fully. If we're not committing to a committee structure and I know this has been raised by the members that we'll have, you know, folks jumping in and out of, you know, different committees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if that's the case and it just comes down to who has a majority on council for every issue and we'll have no order. And if that's the case, we'll just, you know, vote how we feel on every single issue and not have that process, committee process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We did a good job on, you know, let the families process through the Infrastructure Committee process. It worked. I think it you know, we spoke with one voice on delivering the, you know, $208 million there. But the process worked and we anticipate it following that very same process on the Infrastructure Committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'll have a talk with council with the mayor. You know, he has a different vision on how this works. But I'd like to be organized and how we communicate to the federal government as the chair of the Federal Legislative Committee, helping off the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I structure committees. They work when they work. And I would just say, if there's a friendly I believe there is they're friendly on the on the floor or not. It sounded like it was accepted, but they felt like it was rejected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm not sure what they do, except the appointed will work with the village committee to speak with one voice and have a letter together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I accepted that. But I also I don't know what the timing of it is. And we have some urgency, in my opinion, with this letter. But I, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I we can get through the schedule. Councilmember. Well, I would just say that we've all we've experienced a little bit of frustration with the committee process in terms of moving important items before the, the, the, in bringing items before the Council and the gamesmanship behind the committee process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if an item is important to and afraid of on the floor here, I think it's important that we. And we move that item. And then obviously the Federal Lands Committee can also weigh in on that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would just say, if there is the friendly here, please make sure that they make the friendly so that the Fed actually takes action on the item. Right. And not a report back on item because that's important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you respectfully that the committees the fellows committee has worked. There hasn't been gamesmanship. I mean, the proof is in what we did deliver with the infrastructure plan. We worked together with the mayor, regional agencies. We spoke with one voice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The plan the plan worked. We're going to take that very same approach to the infrastructure package. That's good. I understand this is important to the council. I understand. But our federal strategy of how we communicate work really well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just want to go to Tyler because, you know, I'm just going to I think I'm going to draw this friendly because this is getting really personal here. I just want to ask Tyler. Tyler, what is the the urgency on sending submitting this letter today?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I keep hearing that there is some urgency. And as sort of the manager of this process, I want you to explain what the urgency is if we have a plan to engage through the reconciliation process. What is that urgency that we're hearing about tonight?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, at this point, we don't know the exact timeline of the entire package, but we anticipate it will take a little while longer for them to finalize both the reconciliation package and the bipartisan bill, which is what that presentation was about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The committee level, I would say, you know, the urgency is that we we had a conversation at the committee level and there is an interest from the committee to make this known to our delegation. But again, we don't know the exact timeline on whether the bipartisan bill might be taken up separately.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't anticipate that, but I'm not exactly sure when this full package will be taken up. Thank you. So the reality is there is no procedural urgency here. This is simply council members saying this is a council priority and I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we just acknowledge this is an independent council priority separate from what we're doing. And I accept and I receive that. Councilman Superman. Thank you as a member of the Senate led committee. And first of all, I recognize respect the fact it's up to the chair to set the agenda, but I'm not aware that we've embarked upon'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this at all. I think our last meeting was April 29th. Great presentation by Mr. Small. I think it was really enjoyed that. Yeah, but it was a receiving file. But I don't know that we've so far we haven't embarked upon what the other committee has done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we're going to move forward on that, I just don't have any background in it at all. So I just want to mention that, Mr. Vice Mayor, if I could make a suggestion, I sort of think it's okay to say here's one priority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we can specifically say in the letter that we expect the city of Long Beach to be providing additional information on priorities within the federal legislation. If that is something that the council is worried about. Thank you, Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I think that there's a little bit more to the story, too. I mean, Fed Ledge worked together with economic development on the priorities for the last bill. And I think that in the same way that economic development really took a lead, got out there and met with the community and heard all those things, met with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city staff, pulled it all together along the way. There are. I see. And again, I no disrespect to Dr. Crowley. I think you're excellent. I don't think it's his urgency that we're talking about. I think the urgency is coming from hearing that, especially after our discussion today, of how colleagues collaborate and how they have their own committee'",
        "'speaker_1': 'work. There's value in sending the letter sooner so that our delegation has a formal notice that this is something that we want them to start collaborating with their colleagues on because it's not under consideration at all. And a lot of times that's a planting the seed far.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But for any procedural urgency, there are discussions and dialogs that happen. You can bring up topics and other areas and really facilitate the growth of that seed. And so for those reasons, I think that the urgency component is more for a noticing of our delegation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This isn't as much of a noticing to the committees or the formal structure or any of those things. And since that committee has done so much work on this and Councilmember Price has already set several additional meetings and agendas, I think that they're on a great path.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope that if you do have a discussion with the mayor about roles and how that works, that in a similar way to what I had the discussion and you had the discussion with the mayor on the previous package that it's a very collaborative process where Councilmember Price also has a seat at the table.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that for hours we couldn't literally sit at the same table because we were on the same committee and there was all this procedural stuff. But since you both are on the same committee, I think that that's a a very good opportunity to start that collaborative process between two committees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. And actually, that's a good example. On the economic process, we did begin we began the process of discussing the economic proposal. There was a change at one point in committee leadership, but what ultimately happened was the advocacy took place on the federal side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the policy work and that happens in a lot of different bodies, the policy work will take place in a policy committee that expert has expertize and then the advocacy happens in advocacy committee, the led, federal and state led committee or advocacy committees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They take those things. They coordinate the advocacy, the lobbying group. We served on these committees together. I think what you're proposing actually is exactly what I'm saying. I think our lobbying efforts should be coordinated. So I don't think the there needs to be a fight here just to talk about we know what works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, Councilman Super and I'll mention that April is when we have the committee. Absolutely right. That's when we were focused on the federal the bill, the Federal Recovery Act. And so we focused on the Federal Recovery Act in many ways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, you know, so that's what I envision in this process. And I think that's where we can ultimately get to. Are you caught up again, Councilman Mongo?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I guess I would just say that having served on Fed Ledge with you for years, back when we first started, advocacy is more than just one committee. A lot of us can work. And I did work along with community members and stakeholders and leaders, to continue to provide advocacy for our priorities for economic development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Though there were no federal legislative trips at that time due to COVID, there was still a lot of discussion around what's possible and other ways that we can engage. And I had several. I remember sitting at the facility next to Congressman Lowenthal and at any opportunity that any one of us has the ability to advocate for our'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city and us to get funding and our priorities. I just I know that we should take those opportunities because that is what's expected from our residents and neighbors. So glad we came to a place where we can all work together and supportive of this item.'",

However, the item was agenda item that received the file on the report so the committee could not even consider taking a motion on the bill or position on the bill, despite all three committee members voicing opposition to the bills during the committee meeting.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'However, roughly nine in ten. Applies a one size fits all approach to the entire state without the benefit of community input and extensive work that we put in at the local level to address our housing crisis. The legislation requires that by right approval, this new housing for completing the important local government review process that includes extensive public'",
        "'speaker_0': 'engagement without any requirement that the new housing development. The affordable housing. As we all know, it takes time for new housing to be built. We're seeing new housing opportunities, including affordable housing, in many parts of our city today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're seeing more reuse built throughout the city. But at the same time, we've work to preserve the integrity and distinct character of our many great neighborhoods in our city. This legislation is opposed by a broad coalition of hundreds of local government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'League of California Cities. Social justice advocate. Affordable housing group. Neighborhood Council. And many others. So tonight I'm asking my colleagues to join me in urging Governor Gavin Newsom to veto these bills and instead let our city continue to work to meet our housing needs with our local community input and policies and zoning that take into account our'",
        "'speaker_0': 'own local needs. The Long Beach Way. Thank you. I asked my colleagues, do you think you can form Mongo?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I. Brought the initial item forward. I think that there has been a lot that we've learned through the years on how much a bill can change during the process. And I think that it's important for committees to be active and hear what the bill says and where it stands and then to advocate for those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I've appreciated each committee's opportunity to do that. In hearing that, a majority of the members on the committee were supportive of opposing Senate Bill nine and ten. I had hoped that the committee would bring it to the full council in a similar way that we were just discussing another item that came to the full council because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it had an unanimous committee support. So with that, I'm very supportive of this item. I appreciate council member Austin taking the leadership to bring it out of committee, even if it was a solely slated item. I think we've all learned a lot on Brownout because of the way that it came to the table.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that. And the advice and guidance of our city attorney and the changes we've made as the council. And I hope my colleagues will support this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman, your anger to comes from our mongo. That is precisely the point that did not come out to the committee. It came out through to the city council directly. We did have a robust discussion at the state level committee about these two items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was a receive a final item that we voted on. And despite the feelings of the other members that were there still was a receipt, a final item that should have gone to the state committee for a vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we're going to come to the council and which had been brought separately, it was not. It came directly here. And that that's my issue with the with this item at this point, which I will not be supporting because of the procedural effort on that, just that we've had before in other committees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we just had a discussion right now about the committee structure and what it does that we're supposed to do and we're supposed to work together. We are. But when we had and, you know, many of us have been here for a number of years now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we know the process and we know what we our expectations are. And we need to work together on trying to bring things forward. Now, in these two areas right now, I think that this letter to the governor is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More symbolic than anything else. The governor is going to sign it all the it's passed both legislature, the legislature and the House. I mean, the assembly and the legislature. It's a it's a done deal. Now, there's other ways I understand from my participation other in other organizations, committees, that there is a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Growing effort in the community to bring a vote to the people of California. There's there's petitions being circulated that will address both SB nine and every ten. That'll be, of course, later on down the line. I'll wait for that to see what the result of that is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But right now, I think my vote for this would be a symbolic vote. And I don't do symbolic vote. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Arthur. So the symbolic vote was the receiver filed in committee? That was the symbolic vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you, Mr. Raja, respectfully had the ability to determine whether that was a receiving vote or if that was a straight up and down vote for a recommendation to come before this committee. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm not done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I actually didn't realize. I let everybody speak once. I didn't realize we had public comment. So I'm an invite to public comment if you want to queue up and speak right after that, I want to finish my point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You go you get this final point that we're going to public. Okay. So the point is that, yes, you spoke in committee and you said that you were opposed to both SB nine and ten. There was it was unanimous all three members and so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'During the committee, I said, Well, why aren't we bringing this to the floor and let's bring it to the floor. So I brought it to the floor and I gave you, Mr. Chair, as well as our vice mayor, who was also on the committee, the opportunity to serve on the bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And both of you declined to sign on the bill. One on item two, to oppose this legislation here on the floor as a body, as a city council, and to send that message to the legislature and the governor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just have to call it what it is. You said the process, I think is disingenuous. And I think to members of the public here. Dietrich Geiger and Janet Foster, if you can come forward, the Dietrich here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Dietrich first and then Janet. I'm a resident of district shares in the island district and I am coming today to urge you guys to support those SB ten and to not oppose it. I come today with the perspective of a real estate agent who works primarily with first time homebuyers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those are renters. A lot of them are Long Beach residents. And it really sucks because a lot of the times I have to tell them, most of the time they cannot buy a house and they are not poor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They are not low income. They are not $100,000 income earners either. To tell them that if they want to buy, they either have to get a small little condo over here in downtown or they have to be back to the desert.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They don't want to do either. They do not want to be super commuters. They want to own a home. They want to build equity. They want to have something they can pass on to their kids or that they can have something as a back up for themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please support SB nine and SB ten and increase the housing that we have here in our city. And an all star for you. Thank you. Thank you. Next identified the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Thank you for this chance to speak to you. I am I am a resident of District two and also I am a co-leader of the Long Beach chapter of Yimby. And I'm asking this Council to support SB nine and SB ten.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I enjoyed a lot of the spirited conversation tonight, particularly with Councilmember Mongeau stating that Long Beach is doing as much as we can in terms of dense housing related to transit. There's still another thing that Long Beach can participate with and also the cities that are mentioned where they're not doing as much as Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of times one of the key components of SB nine and SB ten deals with the single family lot, and that, unfortunately, in California as a whole has been weaponized a lot. Whether it's based on equal access, opportunity to purchase, or whether it's from working and middle class earners as well as it has a history.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we all know that history of how single family lots were leveraged in the 1950s and this is the last vestige of this. And I asked this council to not ask the governor to veto SB nine and SB ten.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. So I'm going to offer my my comments on this on this item. I don't see any other council comments here. So I want to thank Councilman Austin for bringing this forward, I think. What I want to say is that I think we've we've been very clear time and time again and throughout the years'",
        "'speaker_0': 'about the issue of local control. Long Beach protect local control in our state legislative agenda. It's been there. It's not new. We advocate in support of protecting local control already as a part of the legislative agenda. We've submitted amendments on nine and ten, many of which have been accepted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I and and I personally opposed a number of these bills. And my role as president is guard and other roles. And it wasn't because I don't doubt. I don't deny the housing crisis that we have. In fact, and I've been a champion on a number of things and had very difficult conversations around the green and other things'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so I think the issue is that I personally believe that we should try to maintain land use decisions as local. Also been clear. Even recently I expressed my opposition to these bills at the state level committee. I met with the governor's office who?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just two weeks ago. Talking about this bill and the prospects of the future of the bill. I met with them just to just two weeks ago in my capacity as the immediate past president of Sky. So the city's position, my own position on the city council have been very public about their position on local control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's that's not an issue here. I think I think there's also a reality that we should acknowledge that that Janet brought up and nice to meet again that Janet brought up is that single family housing in general in a number of cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I notice of our regional high single family housing has been used as a means to block any growth from taking place. And the ultimate result of the, you know, the abuse of single family housing is that housing and the burden.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The burden of density gets pushed on things like Long Beach because other cities have not done their part. And so and in that from that standpoint, the state has attempted to take action to fix the issue of the squeeze down in one area and push everybody out of one community popped up in the other, and it exacerbates'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the homelessness crisis. And so from the state standpoint, I actually understand why five or six members of our local delegation voted to address this, and the state has taken action. You've got you know, in the last week or so, the legislature approved a bill with 28 to 6 vote in the Senate.'",
        "'speaker_0': '45 to 19 in the Assembly. Now, I wish this hadn't been the case. But the reality is that's the case. This is an issue statewide. We advocated for protections for us here in Long Beach. Many of those have been included.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's the hard reality, is that although we wish that hadn't happened, the state has taken that action. And so I think. Personally with overwhelming support in the legislature. I think the things that are you know, in the conversation with the governor's office, I think the reality is that this thing is going to be fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is the law. The state is taking action. This is about to happen. And thinking about that, I think, what's this? This vote is going to have very little impact on the actual trajectory of the bill. So what are we doing tonight?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we have to really think about, you know, we're already on the record. We're already in one place. What action are we taking tonight? Are we taking an action to shift the course of this process? I don't believe that that's possible at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From a process standpoint, I think it's time to be honest with residents, that it's time to be honest with the residents and and it's time to move on from this issue. And so tonight, for that reason and for many reasons, I don't think that this is the action the city lobby should take tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And moving to ask the governor to veto this, it is not likely to happen. And we need to move on from this issue and be honest about the reality of this legislative session and what we need to prioritize in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's it. I think we have one more Councilwoman Margo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I honestly just don't know. You'd stated that we are already on the record with our position on these items. Dr. Hurley Had we sent our position on these items to the delegation or. What was our position formally?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city is neutral on the bill currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And why are we neutral when the state legislative agenda states that we are against removing local control?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, in terms of SB nine, one of the main things that have changed since last year, this is the bill that was closest to SB 50, which the city opposed last year and this year. The bill basically is the definition of local control in the sense that city would have to make an effort to take an action'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in order to avail ourselves of the streamlining that allowed in the bill. So in terms of SB ten, that's one of the core changes over the last year and a half or so. And on the SB nine, I think as the Vice Mayor was referring to, one of the items we added to the state legend of this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'year was in response to some of the conversations that council has had recently actually for the development of single family homes into multi-unit properties. We included a new item to allow for more advocacy around reasonable requirements on those developments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So one of the things that we did try to incorporate in 39, how much is around affordability requirements as well as owner occupancy options for local agencies to impose? And that is one of the things that did get amended into SB nine this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now there is a requirement for property owners to subdivide using SB nine to sign an affidavit that says that they will live in one of their residences for at least three years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm very supportive of those things. I guess my just misunderstanding is. We currently have more control than we would have if this bill passes. That could. That's what I thought. Our former presentation stated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So this takes away some of our local control and we as a council have advocated for more local control. And I appreciate, Dr. Crowley, that you got a lot of the things in there for us. And I know that as a councilmember who was very engaged in consistently working with Chris and Oscar and all the crew'",
        "'speaker_1': 'over there, we were consistently working to improve the bill. Before figuring out now that it's out of state where it probably will be. My agenda item was to refer it to committee at that time, but I think it's important, even if we are okay with some things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My understanding is that local control is still what we believe is. The strikes. And so for those reasons, it is. What would you say we have as an official position? You said no position. So I guess I'm confused by the vice mayor's comments when he says that we are already on the record on this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could you help me understand how we're on there? I just don't know. We have not sent any formal on the record of our opinion of these bills or have we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not on behalf of the city. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. I appreciate Councilmember Austin for inviting me to be a part of this, because I do think it's important that we take an official position on requesting the governor veto these two bills. We'll see what happens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Kirby, for all the hard work you've done through this session. And to everyone who's engaged, we know this is important to everyone. And thank you and also for continue to focus on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Members, please cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Emotion fail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So I think we're that satisfies the agenda. We're now at closing public comment. I don't have a list.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice-Chair We have item 39 and also item 29 being withdrawn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have two more. Okay. Left here 39 and 29. 39.'"
