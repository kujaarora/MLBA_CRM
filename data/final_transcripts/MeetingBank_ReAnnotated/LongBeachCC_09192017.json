    "Resolution on EIR 02-16 and Southeast Area Specific Plan Appeal.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Now we're going to go into our first hearing, which is the CCP hearing. So I just need to make an announcement. I do believe there are a few folks that are outside for CCP, so I know that they can hear me and I know we're going to do a oath for those that want to talk on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the item. So I just want to make sure that we also allow that our our folks are managing the flow of people that we allow. The folks are going to do see CIP to come in and then they can be escorted out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess, however, they're going to do that up up in the up in the back. So let me go ahead and begin by taking the item. We're going to do an oath first, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All those who intend on participating. Please stand up and raise your right hand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you're here for SIP for the planning, I do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You and each of you solemnly state that the testimony you may give in the cause now and pending before this body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I'm assuming also that there's folks outside that took the oath that want to come in to speak on C-SPAN. Did we arrange that? We're fine. Okay, great. All right, so I will now turn this. Open the hearing and turn this over to staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. This item will be presented by Amy Burdick, our director of development.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Services, and Christopher Coons, our advance planning officer.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. Mayor. Members of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City council in the audience, thank you very much for your.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Participation and attendance tonight. The sea dip.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ordinance is 41 years old. It is the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Oldest planning ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have spent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over three and a half years updating this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ordinance, and we were able to do this through the the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Generosity of the state of California, through a California.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Department of.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Conservation Sustainable Communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Planning grant.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Without that almost $1,000,000 contribution, we would not be able to be here today. I'm going to ask Christopher.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Coons to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Provide an overview.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the three and a half year planning process that culminates.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Hopefully this evening. And then also remind you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With the assistance of Mr. City attorney, that this is an appeal hearing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we will go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Through an appeal process as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With that, I'm turning it over to Christopher Coons, her advanced planning officer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, city council members. And so this evening. We're talking about the southeast area specific plan which will replace Planning District one, also known as CDEP up. So this gives you the general area. You've got Seventh Street, which becomes the 22 and the northern area, you've got PCH Highway one running through the center of the site and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'you also see Second Street running through the lower portion of the site. So as Amy mentioned, this is a project that was based on community engagement and was community driven. So this project began with meetings large and small to really establish a community vision of what is it that folks want to see in the southeast part of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach, not just today, but into the future? And this is a plan that reaches out all the way to 2016, but also deals with our issues today and tomorrow. So on the screen, you see some of our our larger meetings and those ranged from community advisory committee meetings, open houses, workshops, drop ins at farmer's markets and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'other places. But these also involved numerous meetings with existing groups and individuals. If there was a group that wanted to have a meeting, we participated in that meeting. We listened to all voices and because of the great participation we received from the public, we were able to craft a plan that we're all proud of and it would'",
        "'speaker_0': 'not have been able to happen without that community engagement process. This is the plan from 1977. So this plan represents an outdated approach to development for a few reasons. You'll see on the screen our wetland areas flanking PCH and Second Street were originally and 77 contemplated for development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not an approach we would take today. This plan also does not allow for mixed use. And lastly, it wasn't really a plan. It was a collection of rules compiled based on what had been built and what was anticipated to be built.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it wasn't driven by a community vision in the same way that the plan currently in front of you today is, which establishes a a clear route to create spaces that will be enjoyable and beneficial to the community as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is the land plan for the item before you this evening. It makes a few major changes. It protects wetland areas and open habitat area. It concentrates the only areas of change on two sites that are already developed today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we're talking about is locations where there are existing shopping centers or existing hotel uses that could be reimagined and redeveloped in the future. It allows for mixed use, which is consistent with its setting. And it provides updated standards, context, sensitive design and a pathway to achieving community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Key to this plan is enhancing the wetlands and coastal resources. So we talked about setting aside natural areas for protection in perpetuity, but this plan goes further than that and it does include a wetlands restoration and monitoring fund that future projects will be paying into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it also includes provisions that every project is built correctly and in deference to its setting adjacent to our wild areas. So what are bird safe treatments? This is something we spent a lot of time on developing during this plan and birth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Safe treatments come down to three big areas glass plants and lights. So it means making sure that birds of all type can tell the difference between open sky and building glass. It means using plants that are appropriate next to our wetland habitat area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those are California native plants. And this will be one of the most progressive plants in the United States. And in terms of landscaping and it means lighting, it means using lighting that's appropriate that lights the building but not surrounding areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it means working together, not just in the design process, but with future residents and businesses to make sure that that light is really limited, especially at night. Lights up for birds. So this plan is really also about creating organic and compelling placemaking as part of development, not just having x square feet of retail or white square'",
        "'speaker_0': 'feet of residential, but really having those places where community happens and allowing for community gathering places and a sense of experience. A sense of place and a sense of pride. This is also about building form and architecture and creating something that is really befitting of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is our entryway into the city for many visitors every day. And it's we don't have our best face forward today, I think would be the best way to describe it. So it's about creating places that are human scale but are exciting and vibrant and invite a positive image for our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's also about building orientation. So believe it or not, there is a beautiful waterway behind what you know today as Ralph's and Best Buy. You don't know that because those buildings block the view of the water and turn their back on the water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a way to flip that. There is a way to have you corridors to our waterfront and to have a great environment for future residents, current residents and visitors to all enjoy our waterfront, to stop and have a meal, but stay a while, maybe do some shopping, or maybe just come and enjoy the space with your'",
        "'speaker_0': 'family and meet some new friends. It's also about open space amenities and creating useful open space between these future buildings that will benefit future residents, current residents and visitors. So it's also about including the streetscape. During our outreach process, there are a lot of different adjectives used by the community to describe PCH.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Most people did not describe it as beautiful or as the best street in Long Beach or as something they were particularly proud of. So part of this plan is really about changing that engagement between the built environment and the street and having buildings that have interesting and exciting edges with the street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's also about increasing connectivity. We know that we are a city of cars and many folks will continue to drive. But it's also about giving people other choices, including biking and walking and improving the environment for all forms of mobility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To that end, this project increases bicycle lane miles in the area by 79%, 29% increase in pedestrian facilities and a 9% increase in roadways for cars. This just gives you an idea of the reimagining of PCH. So this shot here is sort of approaching the Marina Pacifica shopping center today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So imagine separated bike lanes where you feel safe, new planting medians, trees and somewhere that you're not just comfortable, but somewhere that you want to return to because you have a positive experience in terms of positive, increased connectivity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The most common concern about the project was about the traffic at Second and PCH. There's some things that we can do, but there are limits to what we can do about traffic. So one of the ideas we're doing in this plan is breaking up the super blocks and making sure that if you don't have to go through'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that intersection, you don't have to go through that intersection, that you can get around different sites and that you have an internal street grid instead of the giant super blocks that you see out there today. So if I'm a resident in Naples and I'm trying to get where Ralph says today, there's no need for me to go'",
        "'speaker_0': 'through that second and PCH intersection. Once we have a better functioning internal street grid and I can get through the different sites without going through that major intersection. So I was asked to keep it brief. But just in summary, I think what we've done with this plan is really try to accomplish a community goal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We did that through coming up with development standards that were sufficient to attract private investment and create all these amenities and improvements that we talked about, but are also scaled appropriate to their setting and this unique location near the water and near our great wild areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that concludes the staff presentation and we're available here at the staff table for all your questions. Okay. Now, of course, this is a a hearing. So the way this works is the city has made a presentation. There is an.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appellant We have one. Appellant Correct me if I'm wrong is Mr. City Attorney. So the one appellant has asked for 15 minutes, so we will do 15 minutes for the one. Appellant And is he just come on down?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we will also I know that the appellant has also asked for rebuttal time. So what we'll do is if there is additional comments after this by staff, then we'll grant the rebuttal time. If there's not, then there's obviously no need for the rebuttal time if there isn't any additional comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sounds good. Okay, let's go ahead. And, Madam Clerk, you'll have the time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank so much, honorable mayor and City Council for having us here today. My name is Warren Lisowski. I'm the president of Long Beach, Citizens for Fair Development. Mr. Salisbury, we're taking notes. I'm actually the president of the organization.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'd like to start out today to thank staff for their presentation and just point out a couple of issues that I don't have the agenda in front of me. So City Council and Honorable Mayor, I ask you to look at each of these decisions that are being made individually.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Very often decisions come before you and there are many items that are grouped together. So let's just break down exactly what's happening today. The staff is proposing that you repeal and replace the existing PD one set up. It is our position that, yes, leadership is inadequate due to the age.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But see, this does have vital protections for the wetlands. And so instead of repealing and replacing c dep CDEP could have been updated in such a way to protect the wetlands better. Just a couple comments directly related to the staff's report.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If you remember when we did study sessions in these chambers, the members of the public commented that whatever happened at those community meetings was not accurately reflected in the document. So I just let the record to be clear that the citizens feel that what happened at those study sessions is not in the documents.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I've given you each a letter, a three page letter outlining some of the problems. What we've got here is we can't look at just this as a zoning change we have, and we must look at the totality of what's going on in the southeast area.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Let's remember that a brand new gas fired power plant was just approved by S.C. The planning commission here has approved three seven story buildings filled with 90,000 gallons of lithium ion battery, the same stuff that was in the note five when you couldn't bring a milliliter of it on the airplane.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They want to put 90,000 gallons of it on the wetlands with no additional fire resource and also with no environmental review. The Planning Commission simply approved a mitigated negative declaration for the Battery Tower. If this if this if you vote yes on all of this today, what we are going to end up with is not what?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Not wetlands protection. There is going to be 80 foot buildings if a hotel mixed use is used under the plan. The biology in this environmental impact report is woefully inadequate. It does not talk about how the biological resources will be preserved in light of these 80 story buildings.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I would like to draw your attention back to the local coastal planning program. The local coastal program was adopted after set up in 1980 as under the California Coastal Act and. The the local coastal plan says that the conservation goals and policies of the Coastal Act should be are there for the preservation of all those through those'",
        "'speaker_12': 'wetlands. The local coastal plan also describes CDEP and the accompanying resource management plan as being inextricably intertwined. And so really the way these documents are written, the local coastal plan, sea depth and the resource management plan, they really cannot be extracted from one another.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if you are repealing PD one side, if you're also repealing those portions of the local coastal plan and the resource management plan included within. A couple other problems. As the low Cerritos Wetlands Trust pointed out in their letter from their attorney, Michelle Black, The Post reads, This plan is inconsistent with the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Why? Why is this body spending time to update a specific plan when we know that the general plan does not conform to state guidelines? So wouldn't it make more sense to update the general plan first and then update the specific plans to be in line with that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Also, there's a new government code section 60 50302 that stems from Senate Bill 1000. It's the environmental justice piece of general plans. Now, staff at a earlier meeting stated that these new elements that are being passed have paid some type of service to the Environmental Justice under Senate Bill 1000 with the people of Long Beach wants.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What the environmentalists want is we want what the state Senate voted for us and what the governor signed into law. We want an environmental justice element, not just environmental justice, to be dealt with from time to time in the different elements of the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Let's talk about the certification of the final air today. California Environmental Quality Act secure its its California's broadest environmental law and secure it gives the fullest protection of the environment within reason, the fullest protection. This plan does not give the force protection.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is a development plan. This is an oil drilling plan. Even though the misnamed Wetlands Restoration Program, which more aptly should be named the 50 year oil drilling in the wetlands program, is not in front of you today.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That land exchange or oil drilling plan cannot happen without this CDEP being repealed. So I'd like you to take a second to think about the gravity of what you're doing today. You've got an environmental protection on our last remaining wetlands, and Long Beach staff is asking you to remove those protections and replace them with a development plan'",
        "'speaker_12': 'allowing 80 foot tall hotels in the buffer areas around the wetlands. The California Coastal Commission sent a letter from a scientist named Kate Kate Hochul Bridge regarding the wetlands, oil consolidation and Restoration Project. And she's got 32 pages from the Coastal Commission about about the problems with these plans.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So let's not forget that this sea dep and this oil drilling are one in the same. Let's go back to the local coastal plan that was adopted in 1980. The local coastal plan states that the city shall ask the Coastal Commission for aid and funding to effect the determination of the location and boundaries of the wetlands and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'their buffer areas for restoration. IT when we were here about the pool, the Belmont Pool Project, the attitude of this body and the staff was, let's ask for the biggest project we can and then let Coastal Commission trim it down.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I remember Councilman Iran, I didn't think that was maybe the best idea. Coastal Commission staff is right here in downtown Long Beach. Your staff can meet with Coastal Commission. You can form these policies together. You don't have to ask for something that's outsized, that's damaging to the environment.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then have Coastal Commission object to it. This can be this can happen in a more collaborative setting. Another way that the air is inadequate is there's something called the Low Cerritos Channel Watershed Group. It's made up of the cities of Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Lakewood, Long Beach, Paramount and Signal Hill and the L.A. County Flood District.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's a watershed management program. This document in the jurisdiction section of the air did not come up at all. That's just one reason why the air is inadequate. I wanted to respond to a couple more of staff's points.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There was a beautiful slide called Placemaking. I went to high school in Long Beach. Placemaking was not a word. Okay. That's a made up word by the consultant. I think they've got place in the name of their business.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's the same consultant that's doing the Dewey Plan that brought 60 people here to object to it. So our recommendation is stop using place works. They don't. They do not. Their values and the residents of Long Beach values are do not resonate with each other.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Environmentalists and community activists. We don't want place works here in Long Beach. One more thing is staff had a beautiful slide called building orientation, talking about the the underused backside portion facing the Marina Pacifica condos from Best Buy and Ralphs.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Some beautiful pictures there. They've got sailboats sailing down the channel there. It makes me think that these consultants have never even been there before because everyone knows you can't have a sailboat sailing down between Marina Pacifica condos and Best Buy.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if they have spent time there. Once again, I do not think they have an understanding of how the southeast area of Long Beach operates. Couple other points here, because I do want to save a few minutes. Let's think about where we are in the world right now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Let's think about what's happened the last few months. Let's look at the horrible hurricane in Houston. I mean, Houston, we all heard it on the news. We all heard it from the commentary. Unchecked development was the cause of a lot of that flooding, unchecked development in Houston.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The developers were allowed to build wherever they want, and that ended up with freeways being below sea level. And that led to the death and destruction on top of what was already a horrible natural disaster. Let's think about what's in that water that those people had to wade through.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That was the biggest oil production facility in the world there on the Texas coast. And now it's become a toxic soup that those people are going to have to live with for the rest of their lives. We have yet to see the spike in cancer, the spike in miscarriage.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We don't know what the health effects are going to be. Now, let's look at the low street, those wetlands that are going to be unprotected if you pass this law tonight. We know sea level rise is imminent. We know there's an earthquake fault running across the wetlands between the oil production facilities.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'All it takes is a small tsunami. It could be a couple of feet tall. All it could take is a couple of feet of storm surge. And all those oil operations and all that residential area. And your beautiful pictures of PCH will be covered in the same toxic soup that's covering Houston right now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We demand that that does not happen. We beg of you to not pass this resolution. There's a couple of other things regarding development. I know staff really wants to put these tall, mixed use buildings in the L.A. Times yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Downtown Los Angeles has a 20% residential vacancy rate. People can't pay 30 $500 for a one bedroom apartment. Something else that's lacking with this E.R. and why it should not be certified is the cumulative impacts are lacking. This body's proposing to certify a specific plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Er it's a programmatic element. That Environment Impact Report does not mention the Battery Towers. It does not mention the battery plans. It does not mention the land swap. So California's Sequoia insists that the cumulative impacts of any environmental projects be recognized.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And finally, this. This area falls under the Clean Water Act. These are waters of America. And even though our current administration wants to redefine the waters of America to a more narrow definition, this body should stand up and protect the waters of America.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And finally, what do we want? We want you to delay this vote. This body has broad powers to change the land use via the general plan zones and the specific zoning zones. So what we're asking you to do is to start to break long beaches, addiction to oil and fossil fuels.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'California has set a 2040 zero emissions goal. How does a 50 year oil drilling plan in step help a zero emissions goal? Let's follow some of the leaders. When the president said that the people of Pittsburgh didn't vote for Paris, that the people of Pittsburgh voted for him, the Pittsburgh mayor came back and said, no, we didn't'",
        "'speaker_12': 'vote for that. And in fact, Pittsburgh has a zero emission goal by 2030. Companies like Volvo are going to stop making combustion engines. So Long Beach is progressive in many ways. This body is progressive in many ways. And we strongly encourage you to be progressive in your thought for the southeast area and preserve the wetlands that we'",
        "'speaker_12': 'have. If I could reserve the last minute. I appreciate it, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm asking you reserving the last minute for rebuttal or for that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I could have 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Those are some things you can reserve for your other minute. If you want to finish the last minute.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'll just reserve whatever time for rebuttal you would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Okay. So you're going to get 5 minutes for rebuttal. Thank you. Okay, then we're going to turn this back over to two staff and guys. Guys. So let me let's just try to get through the hearing as expeditiously as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're gonna turn over to staff and then after staff does any additional comments, then, Mr. Foss, you have a chance to do a rebuttal, and then we'll do we'll go to the public and of course, the deliberations of the Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Mr. Motorcar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Bullock, Ms.. Burdick will give a short rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, I'm going.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To ask Christopher to start, but I just do want to make one correction. For the record, the appellant said 80 stories.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I would ask the appellant to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Agree that he really meant 80 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I could even council members. So the majority of what you heard is addressed in their written record in the staff report in front of you. I draw your particular attention to the resolution in front of you. Certifying the E.R. includes findings of fact that address the adequacy of the document.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do want to talk about the speaker referenced several related projects in the area and a number of years ago. So over three years ago, when we embarked on this process, the city council at that time declined to do any type of moratorium or interim controls while we were preparing this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, staff, the city has a legal obligation to process applications as they come in based on the laws that are on the books at the time. So the appellant referenced a CC power plant which is replacing existing power plant with a cleaner one that not a city project that's under the jurisdiction of the Energy Commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He referenced the a battery storage facility that was approved by the Planning Commission by Mr. Pisarski. His appeal on that separate project is pending at this time. He referenced the Beach Oil Minerals Partner Project, which Mr. Boesky objected that project in writing during the E.R. but that project has not yet come to hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So beyond that, placemaking is a defined term. There's a whole document about it from the Project for Public Spaces. If people are interested in not all of the projects, most mentioned by Mr. Lisowski are accounted for in the cumulative analysis of the document.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So beyond that, I want to be deferential to the Council's time and we can dove into any of the issues that were brought up. But they are all addressed in your written materials, particularly in those squat findings that are attached to the air certification resolution prepared by the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We're going to have the the appellant please can do. Rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Koonce with response with regards to the California Energy Commission's approval and jurisdiction of the new power plant. Yes, the city does not have jurisdiction, but the city does have zoning and general plan control.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What does that mean? The city could have entered into the S.E.C. process with a generating station as an intervenor. The city could have done what was best for the people of Long Beach and intervened and said, Why do we need another 500 megawatt fossil fuel generating station on our wetlands?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that brings us to yes, there are all these other projects, but let's talk about what this council can do with zoning. I'm going to throw a couple of ideas out here. One of the ideas is. When this new oil drilling plan comes into effect.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I know it's still up in the air, but in all likelihood it's going to be approved. You could add to the zone that any oil drilling, any injection waste, any water injection or chemical injections that those oil developers have to provide a list of all the chemicals that are being injected into the ground.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's a very simple change. As you know, the petroleum industry wants to keep those thousands of chemicals as proprietary. And so under Prop 65, we don't even know what carcinogens are in there. There are all kinds of different benzene and crazy aromatic rings that are carcinogenic.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then finally, with regards to the specific zoning and the general plan, there are guidelines that the state gives you and there are things that are out of your jurisdiction. But this city council, this body, is given the power of zoning, and that's a very powerful tool.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so when you say that the battery tower hasn't been approved, but it's going to go on the wetlands, you could tonight simply add a piece to this new cap that says we don't allow over one gallon or 89,000 gallons of lithium ion flash flammable fluid to be on the wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that is the control you have. One final thought about Mr. Koons and the staff's idea of the inevitability of land use. Yes, certain land uses are by right. We understand that. But the way that staff has often positioned that in front of the council and the planning commission is that the commission and the council must extend'",
        "'speaker_12': 'those land uses by rights to other decisions that are not by right. For example, I'm going to bring in an outside example just to make this point and then I'll wrap up. 320 Alamitos Street What came up before Planning Commission?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They were asking for a building with residential units and it was also on two lots. And staff told the Planning Commission that you have to approve this project because it's buy right for them to build those many units.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You can't change the downtown plan parking ratios without changing the downtown plan. What they failed to let the commission know was that they did not have to buy right approved the lot merger and if they would have simply not approved the Lot merger, then that development could have been squelched.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So don't let staff pull your power out from under you. There are things that you can do to make a difference. You can give landowners their rights and at the same time do what's right for the city of Long Beach and for our wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thanks so much, Mr. Mayor. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Okay. We're going to go ahead now and move on to the rest of the hearing. So we've closed both the applicant out, which is the city in this case, of course, the presenter and the appellant and the time for both the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The rebuttal is now closed. We're going to go to public comment only those that, of course, swore in to the oath and those that are here for this item. So if you didn't see the swearing in, please, please come down to the podium and present yourself, of course, your name for the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, just line up on this and we'll get through these comments and then back to the Council for deliberation on the Ccep item. Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor and City Council. Hi. My name is Bob Paternoster. I'm happy to be here this evening. When I. When I first, I'm going to give you just a little historical context for this project. When I moved to Long Beach in 1977, my first important job as director of planning and building was to try to bring'",
        "'speaker_4': 'closure to the city planning process. The Planning Commission had already appointed a citizens advisory committee. I was pleased that this evening when I came in here and found that Jan Hall, who was head head of that committee, was president, of course she was later Councilwoman Jan Hall, and that that committee consisted of residents, property owners and developers'",
        "'speaker_4': '. That committee had already created a vision for Sea-Tac when I arrived. And that vision was basically that they wanted something like Irvine. I remember back at 1977, Irvine was just blossoming and people were looking at it very fondly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the committee, like the mix of housing units, they were willing to accept smaller than the standard size lot for residential development if the developer would provide lots of open space, bicycle trails and so forth. But at that time, they were deadlocked because the citizens, even though they knew what they wanted, they did not trust the city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to implement that. They did not trust the city to force developers to build that open space in those and those and those. Trails and so forth, because plain old zoning R1, R3 just doesn't do that. And the one small contribution that I think I made to the process was to tell them that there are other land use'",
        "'speaker_4': 'controls that you can use besides standard zoning. For instance, a plan development district. And once they realize that that the the law could require developers to build open space, to build the trails, the bike trails and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then the plan was forward to city council adopted and you had PD one, the first plan development district in the city. Now the plan, the city plan did focus on the area north of the luxury trust channel and residential development because that was where the vacant land was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And since the time of adoption, we've had the construction of a Bixby village with the golf course of the Largo, with Simms Pond of Bay Harbor, Spinnaker Bay, Spinnaker, coves with a new waterfront development not only for a boat boat docks, but also a continuous public walkway along all of that waterfront throughout there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And all of these villages tied together by the city's first class one bike path through residential areas. The wetland was recognized and preserved now after adoption of the plan. It was expanded when we went through the LCP, but it was preserved, as was the the Pacific Flyway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was little concern, quite frankly, for affordability of housing at the time, although we did preserve the the mobile home park and apartments were mixed in with single family residential. But you have to realize what the attitude of the city was back in 1977.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At that time. Young, upwardly mobile family.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Sorry. Time is up. Oh, I know. Sorry about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Let me just end by saying I encourage I encourage you to move forward with adopting the plan. It's been 40 years and it's about time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Yeah, we've got to watch the time, especially tonight, because we have a lot of items from SL.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Watch the time. Even though I don't like it's so short. My name is Jan Hollings, former city councilwoman for the third district in the city of Long Beach, and, as Bob indicated, chair of the original city of committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm here to say that I am opposed to the proposed changes to see death for very specific reasons. There's a lot of good in that plan that's being proposed, but the things that can't seem to be taken care of, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our number one traffic. The city of Long Beach and this end of town are going to be inundated by lots of changes in the traffic without any development. The widening of the four or five freeway in Orange County is going to bring a tremendous increase again on Seventh Street in the Long Beach area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Four lanes of new traffic and it stops at seventh Street. Those cars are going to go somewhere and they are going to impact the Cedar Area and by extension, the areas in the third district. The concern I have about the density is one that is merely an observation that currently there is not a complete build out of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'density that's currently allowed in the city plan. I think we're pushing our luck if we keep adding more people without some kind of traffic solutions. Number three, the idea of the height limits currently the height limit is is three stories, as you all know, and is being proposed to be 5 to 7 stories.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that that kind of height will really create a very different. The situation on Pacific Coast Highway then is in being envisioned by the planning department and the consultants. And by that I mean is that if you have five and seven story buildings along Pacific Coast Highway, effectively from Lloyd's Drive to the SEAL Beach border, you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really are creating a barrier along that whole stretch of land. I know there'll be some adjustments to build it back, but I am concerned that that barrier will change the entire atmosphere in the third district and kind of undo what basically has been created in the third district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so with those for those reasons and several others, I just would like to issue my propose my opposition to this proposal. And thanks, Suzy Pryce as the councilwoman. It's a tough decision and it isn't going to be easy no matter what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor and City Councilmember. My name is Randy Gordon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am president and CEO of Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. On behalf of the Chamber and our leadership, we strongly support, she said, which all of you know is a huge opportunity for Long Beach, not just from a business perspective, but so many.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Other ways as well. The plan will allow for mixed use projects with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Residential, retail, commercial and hotels. This will create thousands of new construction jobs related jobs over the course of the next 10 to 15 years. It will attract a new high end retail, which will create thousands of jobs for residents and most importantly, will keep sales tax revenue in Long Beach that now migrates to south to Orange County'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We see the opportunity for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Incredible economic synergism with Long Beach State, the retail, residential communities in Naples and Belmont Shore and all other communities throughout the city. And as far as potential projects as they come online, we absolutely believe this will assist the east side of Long Beach to start driving sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dollars north to our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From SEAL Beach, Huntington Beach and other nearby areas. It will.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Desperately needs and deserves to welcome visitors from our communities and will help all of us who are working to promote Long Beach as a great place to bring your business. Also included in the plan, it's a benefit to the environment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It provides funding through development fees and other grants to improve the current declining wetlands. Lastly, and probably the biggest impact to the city and the reasons enough to pass this tonight, it will create millions of dollars annually to the city through sales tax and property tax revenue.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Resident.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just down.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I believe the record will show over attended all of the advisory committee meetings, a very large number of the city, the community gathering meetings. And I must compliment the staff and the Place Works group that have done a magnificent job of hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All kinds of suggestions and reaching out to every conceivable interest. And I would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just quite amazed at how well that progress went. And I'm very much in price in favor of the project that looks out 50 years, not back 50 years, and what.'",

If you reject this, at least reduce the duced intensity of alternative to one story buildings on all in the within 300 feet of the wetlands and require three storey buildings in the rest of the area and take any new oil development'",
        "'speaker_3': 'out of this plan. I have worked to change CDEP for 20 years because of two threats extending Studebaker Road through the wetlands and allowing homes on the wetlands. This has been eliminated with this plan, but what we've gotten with C CIP is many times worse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over 5400 additional residential units, five story buildings on property surrounding the wetlands, extension of Shop Keeper Road through the wetlands, seven story hotels. And they say the significant, unavoidable impacts are going to occur in air quality cultural resources, greenhouse gas, emission, noise, transportation and traffic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That means nothing's going to be done. About those 5 to 7 story buildings are a menace for birds. Bird safe glass is being required on only 90% of the buildings. It should be on everyone. The FDA, the FBI are future further states that only the areas facing the wetlands will receive bird safe treatment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In other words, birds flying out of the wetlands will be protected. Those flying into the wetlands will be striking 60 to 80 foot buildings with untreated gap glass. Another danger to wetland wildlife was not mentioned in this air.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it goes with new dwelling units right next to the wetlands. With that comes domestic pets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not all owners keep their dogs and cats inside or on leash. Even one dog or cat can be devastating to breeding success of many of the ground nesting birds.

My name is Ricardo Perdomo, and I'm a local business person. I've had the pleasure of living in the island, Naples Island, for about 15 years now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's just a great, great neighborhood. And I mean, I just love Long Beach when people ask me, where do you live? I say, I live in Long Beach, and they're like, Why the heck do you want to live in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, obviously we don't know what communities we have and everything that the City of Long Beach has to offer. That being said, I want to thank everybody here on the panel for all your hard work in making the city a much greater place to live.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I'm also here in in April, the actual project. We really want to see something different in our community. We really believe in speaking with many of my neighbors and many of the people that live here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're just really, really tired of actually going through that community, that part of our community, that that part of our city and just seeing what is there now. My city has so much to offer and people don't know about it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this could actually be really one of the huge focus points entryway that can really showcase our city. The project is going to help. Attracting people to our city, is going to have new families, young professionals and just really, really showcase our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also appreciate the fact that this also has written in the plan where it's going to actually help preserve and restore the wetlands. Thank you guys very much as well for pushing the bike paths and the walk and the walking paths.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a really great thing to have and this project is also going to help. I actually having those those incorporated into their into their project. That's one of the big selling points that sells our city as a forward thinking city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Help us make the city shine. Approve this project. Thank you very much. I encourage you say yes on this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And before we go to the next speaker, we do have folks in line. Obviously, a lot of public comment as well as outside for this item. So we're going down to 2 minutes unless there's any objection from the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there's an objection, we'll go back to three C. No objection. Madam Clerk, we're going out of 2 minutes. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name is Susan Phillips. I live at 6125 East Ocean Boulevard. I'm not particularly opposed to this project, but I'm opposed to some of the parts of this project. I feel that if we're going to say 3 to 5 stories and then it says a little caveat down at the bottom seven storeys with an okay by'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a committee, I'd like to know which committee it is like. Is it you? Is it the city manager's office? Is it the developers? Is it the planning commission? I think if we're going to say 3 to 5 storeys, we should say 3 to 5 storeys, period.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we should have some rules about it. Long Beach has always been a city of neighborhoods, and I hope that whatever we're doing, we don't just develop. The city is called us now an urban area. And I hope that within the planning that we're choosing to do, we can maintain the independence of our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's really important to the beauty of Long Beach, and we all live here because we love our neighborhoods. And the last thing I like to say is just about this process, just in case, you know, the pit, the pictures that you saw up there when they were showing the open area, the first part that look really pretty'",
        "'speaker_3': ', those were two storey buildings. I don't know if anybody noticed that about that area. So we're kind of being manipulated here, I feel, because when I went to the Planning Commission meeting, they talked about Bella Terra. So I went out and saw Bella Terra and it's an asphalt jungle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just want you to think about the fact of what we're picking and what we're choosing. That's all. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, honorable mayor. Members of the city council. My name is Jeff Hoffman. I'm a lifelong resident of Long Beach, living in Naples, less than a mile from the intersection of Second and PCH il. The city is going in such a great direction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We see what's been happening uptown with some of the new development up there we've been seeing. What's been happening downtown, I mean, is evident. All the great things that are happening when we drive around here and we we want that for our east side gateway is well, if this has been a really good process over the past'",
        "'speaker_4': 'few years, we've attended the workshops. We've had an opportunity to sit around the table with people who who disagree with us, but that are still neighbors like the person who spoke just before me. So I think it's been a great process, but it's also a really good plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the consultants, I think city staff from the Planning Department have done a really good job taking in all of the input from various points of view. You know, I don't think it's a perfect plan. There's things that I would love in it, but there's people in this room that would absolutely hate the things that I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would have loved. So I think it's a good compromise and is a wonderful opportunity for us to move forward and have some really good development while restoring the wetlands. So I encourage you all to vote for the city plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the testimony. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very good. You. I've been following this since Gary too long. Wanted to build a 70 story tower with a flea market on every corner. One of the. And also, let me start with the one thing I was glad somebody pointed out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've never pointed out before, but it's inane when they show the picture of a sailboat down in the channel behind BestBuy and reading Pacifica, obviously, and then a sailor they'd never heard of being in irons. You can't sell their period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What was intriguing and interesting is the cut through in terms of and I've often thought about this and I'm sure other people have and I hope they put that in there, is that they can put a cut through.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So when you come down the aisle, you're able to cut through the Marina Pacifica behind a behind Albertson's, behind a whatever they are, Gelson's and zip across without having to go through the intersection. The intersection itself raises the point of something I really think should be done before we move forward, and that is study the concept of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a traffic circle, just like we have at where our traffic circle is. They're used all around the world. I know some people don't like them. There's some people that don't like to cross that bridge of the what these speakers pointed out last week, they were at the last planning commission meeting that has a business on Second Street'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that quite frankly, during the week there will be not that much business period in the restaurants, the foot, the floors, the businesses on the second floor, nicely designed or simply not have that traffic certainly during the week.

        "'speaker_4': 'It's a little triangle in the center of the plan here, and it allows for a 3 to 5 story remaking of that particular project. And it makes no sense in that little tiny space, right, right behind our community to go up 3 to 5 stories if they want to put a hotel there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it goes up to seven stories. Look how tiny that little that little spot is there. And what I read, though, the zoning requirements there was an exception for the in and out burger at one story. I don't know why there's one story, not burger.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this little small community here runs up from if they remake it 3 to 5 stories doesn't make sense. It's just going to be a congested area. It's not going to be favorable to the people in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I request that you remake that zoning requirement of three or four, 3 to 5 stories and a limited to one story only. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, City Council. My name is Gordon and I live in the third district. I'm here to ask you to seriously consider the alternatives that have been proposed to you this evening regarding less density, less traffic, and less height.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On this plan, I'm opposed to it because I believe firmly that this is a development plan and not a plan for the protection of wetlands. I'm here to tell you, I was here at City Hall the evening that this grant was announced by our city staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was delighted to hear that the city would get resources in order to do something about this plan. I'm equally dismayed to stand up here tonight and tell you that the process was flawed. Those community meetings were held.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There were 200 people who attended over the course of time. Where were the hundreds and thousands of people who should have been participating in this process? Vice Mayor Richardson, did any of these meetings happen in your district? Councilman, you were on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Did any of these meetings happen in your district? Do you ever drive to the second and PCH intersection? Do you think this should have been discussed outside of the third district? I'm an advocate for process. This process was flawed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This project is flawed. It is too high. It is too dense. There's too much traffic. There's not enough mitigation for those valuable wetlands that need to be restored in the third district of Long Beach. And I ask that you seriously consider alternatives.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It's about saving enough environment, space that it is functional for this community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your time. Ask you to do so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker bruce. Good evening, vice mayor and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Members of the council. I'm Jeff miller. I live in long beach. I urge you to reject Sea CIP as it is currently proposed. Why? Because it would allow new buildings to be too tall. Increased height above the currently allowed 35 feet would be detrimental to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Proposed changes could lead to our stretch of PCH looking like Lincoln Boulevard and Marina del Rey. Another concrete canyon. Increased traffic resulting from increased density would negatively affect city residents and workers. The traffic itself, of course, but also decreased air quality despite the claims by city staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This plan is not supported by the majority of Long Beach residents. This false claim has been stated so often that maybe you believe it. The Sea Subcommittee was not representative of residents. The committee meetings did not provide for adequate public involvement and comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Additional community meetings were not designed. For adequate public input. The wishes of the majority of the residents of the city are being ignored. The CCP should reflect the will of the residents of the city. These half a million people are your constituents, not a dozen commercial property owners and investors along a one mile stretch of PCH.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your allegiance belongs to the residents and businesses throughout the city who would be harmed by this plan. You do not owe allegiance to a dozen developers who would change the character of this vital area of the city. The current construction plan for the old Seaport Marina Hotel property shows that development and profit is possible within the 35'",
        "'speaker_4': 'foot height limit. I ask that you maintain this limit for the good of the city now and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Long into the future. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. I'm Richard Roth. I live in the Long Beach and District three, and I can basically support what the previous speaker just said and the appellant as well. We have this thing has has just has to be smaller.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one thing that I'm not sure was brought up. If today Mexico City or the Mexico City area had a huge earthquake, if we had a and we're going to have a similar event here. And if you're in the area around, well, all of the third district, you're going to be trapped.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we have a serious safety issue that we're ignoring. And I don't think I need to say anymore. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your time. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before you before you start my time. Can I tell you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, I think that's.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The right thing to do, given there's so many people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Interested in this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Issue. Right. This your city manager? Can we check that out? Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So can we take.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Let's start your time. Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you so much. So my name is Elizabeth LAMB. I'm executive director of the Low Street Wetlands Land Trust. Before I say anything else with my brief 2 minutes, I want to thank city staff and thank our council member for the ability to dialog with them and share with them our views.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It means a lot to us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As you know, we are devoted to protecting and restoring flows through this wetlands. So it's a great community resource, not just for local residents, but for everyone who.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lives in Long Beach. Therefore, we need a plan for the Sea Superior that provides the right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Balance of conservation and development consistent with the community context and vision. With that in mind, why we understand that you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Feel pressure to conclude this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We do want to remind you that the general plan.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'So let me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Quickly summarize.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The final few modifications that we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Urge you to include that we.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sent in our final comment letter. Factually, very few.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Acres of the Sea Superior.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are in play here for redevelopment. Actually, less than the 85 acres that was first identified as areas of change because of the fact that second and PCH is moving forward, internal road surface parking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But even that small remaining part that remains will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have a huge impact to the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the wetlands develop depending on how it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Developed. So we support further density.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Further reduced density in the form of an interim baseline density that could be revisited later.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We support.'",
        "'speaker_11': '100,000 square feet of new commercial development, which would bring the total up to 2,000,191 476.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Square feet.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We support 1000 new units, dwelling units for a total of 5070 units and redevelopment of the existing hotel rooms. As my time winds out, I want to tell you that we've put all of these in a specific comment letter to you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And to really emphasize the point that we're not saying don't do anything. We're saying do something that's reasonable and balanced and protects an important resource.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. Council Members.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Michelle Black on behalf of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The La Cerritos Wetlands Land Trust. And again, the Land Trust really does appreciate the changes that have been made to see steps to improve the specific plan and add bird and wetlands friendly policies and mitigation. But the city's general plan is now underway, which was not the case when Seaside was initiated.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's now a strong argument that the sea SAP approval should wait until the general plan update is completed. So there's no question that the general plan is current and complete to provide a legally adequate basis for approval. Our letter laid out a path to approve seize up in advance of the general plan update.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now there are some parallel to approving a specific plan in the absence of a legally adequate general plan. And we see that as a really good reason to ensure that CCEP has included all feasible mitigation measures. If the city chooses to adopt CSF now before completion of the General Plan update, we recommend that you adopt a lower'",
        "'speaker_10': 'interim density as a as Elizabeth mentioned and proposed by the Land Trust, and that's detailed in our letter. And this is a baseline density that could be revisited, as Elizabeth said, and modified in the future. After hearing more public comment and after looking at the analysis that will be generated by the general plan update process, remember additional'",
        "'speaker_10': 'development in this environmentally sensitive and traffic constrained area at any density, interim baseline or reduced density will have significant impacts on the wetlands and the community. The mitigation for this must be very, very carefully worded so that it meets its goals of protecting community and environment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this means that wetland buffers are actually buffers. There's no development.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or recreational activity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Within the buffers themselves. This means that open space is actually open space and not private patios in places the public doesn't know about. And this means that height limits are lower in this sensitive area to protect birds. The inclusion of excellent bird safe measures is laudable, but we're afraid that those gains could be eroded if height limits'",
        "'speaker_10': 'are high. And thank you very much. I'm here to answer any questions on my letter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name's Linda Pemberton, and I'm from Belmont Heights. And. I'm here representing myself as just a neighbor, and I know that I'm in the camp of I would like to see this plan adopted with some change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think most of the people that I talked to are very concerned about the height and the density because of the traffic. And as you know, you're talking all over the city with people about the general plan right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there's a lot of people who are concerned about the same issues. So I just wanted to bring out bring to your attention that with the reduced plan, it actually represents about 22% of the housing needs that Scaggs is saying that the entire city needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's a little high for an area that has going to put all of these almost 56 I mean, 2600 housing units in a little 86 acre space next to a wetlands. And where we have such terrible traffic, I think an increase of 43% in the traffic with probably 18 of our 21 intersections have difficulty'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now. So while I thank you for putting together this this plan, I would like to see the baseline density option with caps on it put into place so that we can move slowly into the future. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Yeah. Hi, I'm Marshall, Dostoevsky. I live in Ocean Boulevard and I'm on the steering committee of the Long Beach Area Peace Network. And I've actually come here for two reasons. One, to support the hotel workers in their fight for justice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the other thing is, I am representing Lebanon, a Long Beach area peace network. And we're interested in peace and social justice. We're really against this whole plan. We think that it's the whole idea of Caesar was to preserve the wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What this is going to do is isolate the wetlands. It's too big. The project. It blocks the wetlands. We're also concerned about the oil drilling. Why are we concerned about oil drilling?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because global warming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or climate change is a real issue. And I think that Long Beach is so oil dependent that we are not really thinking about what's going on in the world. We know that climate change has caused part of the Syrian problem, a civil war.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the social justice issue here is why do we want to pollute our environment and add to the climate change as a city? So I think we have a chance to to try to take care of this problem and to make this this project a much smaller and much more workable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not seven story hotels and everybody's talked about that. The other thing is that I'm a little concerned about was that we kind of lost our right for public comment. We lost a minute. So everyone here is I don't know how many we got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We wrote 30, at least 30 minutes or maybe more. And for the next and hopefully for the next stage of their agendas, the discussion will not be cut off. So thank you very much. Thank you. Next week, a piece.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The evening, we're going to see it. And members of the city council I name is Ward Johnson. I live at 436 Bellflower Boulevard and the Blue. The proposed strip mall that's at second. And PCH is yet another failed attempt by the property owner and another developer to put in another quick and dirty fix to get their money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'out so they can. They can. Which means it's a thing where they got in adequate parking and even the developer mentions that there's not enough parking. There are numerous other health food stores and gyms that people can access easier than going to this new site that's being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The proposed com. This proposal completely fails to offer any solution to mitigate the heavy traffic congestion. That is a huge issue here and only going to get worse if this thing is built. What kind of message does a strip mall send send to people coming into our city as an entry point?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How can it pass in a year when? These architectural renderings that are being offered show north no parking space and are no space between the buildings for the birds to fly through or people to see the ocean. So is there another proposal that needs to go down?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So until they can come up with something?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. And before we go to the next speaker real quick, I just want to make sure. Are there any folks I know if the fire chief is here that are outside for see SIP and if there are?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there are. I want them. I want them to bring them in. I'm not the face. The fire chief here. Where did he go for a sip. Thank you. So then we are going to cut off the speaker's list and we are going to the lady in the back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. She is out. She will be. Unless there's anyone else receivership. Now's the time. Okay. Okay. So Mr. Barnaby, the last speaker for Ccep and he is going once we're done. See SIP. That is the line. Yes. Please continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, my name is Marcos. I live in one more district. I know it's not near dip, but it's still part of Long Beach. And I'm here to support to sip see dip c 72. Very confusing. I go to USC, I'm studying urban planning, master's second year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's planning is such a difficult thing to understand specific plans in particular. So sorry, I don't I'm not good at public speaking, but it's difficult to understand specific plan. So I understand when the public confused and they think that an eight story hotel is going to come in like tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I understand also trust the council and I trust the planning commission and I trust the city that you guys are going to. Build something that connects to the wetlands and not just build the store, its story building that's not going to, you know, connect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to say I support the project, not the project. I support the specific plan. And thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good afternoon, counsel. My name's Melinda Cotton. I live in Belmont. Sure. You've heard a lot about density and traffic and height. And the words 60 feet and 80 feet have been used for the five storied seven story buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, I discovered going through the plan today on page 70 of the development standards, there is a notation that says along PCH, architectural features up to an additional ten feet may be approved by the Site Plan Review Committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're talking about even taller buildings than we were earlier. We're also told we will gain amenities through this plan. Those have never been quantified. We don't know how much a developer will be required to donate. We don't know what this will mean in real terms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And most of us would probably agree that the amenities we have now offer fresh air and sky and trees and views of the mountains and wetlands are more important than where these are unknown amenities. And I think an important part of this is that the additional residences we're talking about are market rate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are not a controlled in any fashion. So they're going to be affordable by the wealthy, by those who can use them for second homes. They will not be affordable for an average Cal State Long Beach graduate or the average worker or family, nor affordable for the low wage workers who desperately need housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're being asked to take on more traffic congestion, more density, more competition for our existing struggling retailers. And they are struggling in Belmont Shore and we will lose the low scale structures and environment that now surround the wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I hope that you will rethink this and lower the height limits and try to help those who need help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. My name is Michael James. Kathy. I reside on 1814 Clark Avenue. I was born and raised in Long Beach, California, and I've been adopted into the tongue verification in Canoe Family. Given the name, Halbert means the Seeker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to speak on behalf of the Native Peoples of Long Beach. Performer and I. I see that so much of California's wetlands have been eaten up by increased development. Just inch by inch, by inch, by inch.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I fear that I'm opposed to this to the rezoning of sea, because I just see a further development that is not good for our wetlands and also paving the way for more oil extraction and fracking on a dangerous earthquake fault.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Newport Beach and Inglewood fault line right there and the constructions there are already going under liquefaction where there's constant movement of the land and sinking. And there's just is too complicated. It's very dangerous. And I want to see an improvement in the environment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll just stop there. And I thank you all for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor and City Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm Robert Fox. I'm the executive director of the Council of Neighborhood Organizations. I'm opposed to this particular plan at the moment. The first reason is the outreach was inadequate, and that was because the database that you all had to use was not updated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We only recently got the current listing of neighborhood organizations to the city about seven months ago. So the process here was flawed. People didn't show up. You had maybe a little over 200 people in the community meetings. That can't be the judgment for this council, not 200 people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Besides which, I have a real problem that the the input from those meetings was not reflected in the staff's report. So I think we need it from now on to have an independent auditor like Laura Dowd do the counting and the metrics on any kind of an evaluation which happens at our our outreach meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm opposed to this also on a structural basis. We have not made any infrastructure improvement issues on the table at this point in time. And we really need to think about this. It isn't a liquefaction zone. We don't have adequate sewers for the extra development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Eight storeys high next to the wetlands seems absolutely insane to me. I mean, 80 feet I mean, 80 feet tall, I think she said. But I mean, it's sort of like blocks in the Sunshine Law in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can't build a building that blocks out all of your son. So I'm concerned here about the density. I know that parking is horrible and I know the traffic is disastrous going through Second Street, and I'd love to mitigate that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I will support anything which mitigates things where the quality of life for the citizens of Long Beach is improved. But I don't think that we need. A rush to judgment here because we're just coming up on the land use element.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when that comes up, we can discuss this. Thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Point before my time starts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next week, a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Piece for Christensen. But the point of order is we're talking to a particular agenda item one Blue Suzuki's appeal. There are several other agenda items under siege. Is there going to be public comment time regarding those?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, there's one public comment period. Time for the city attorney continue for all items.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is our only opportunity. This is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the all of the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Items on the on the agenda items regarding C zip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, correct. Okay. So now can I start my time, please? What's the point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of your time is going continue. I will give you the time at the end.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Go ahead. Thank you, Robert. I mean, Mayor. So so you should have received this from the Long Beach Area Peace Network. I'm not going to read it again. I might read the summary. What I will read, though, because Ms..'",

        "'speaker_3': 'This is an oil drilling plan embraced by a rezoning plan. There is no question about it.

        "'speaker_3': 'Right. We all do. We want to be able to be safe in our employment. And this is this is my hope, peace and social justice, network speaking. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for our darker kids.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Now. So it is very, very complicated. Our concerns have always been the wildlife, of course. Shopkeeper, road extension, the footprint of an extended shopkeeper road has a potential to impact existing neighboring wetlands, including jurisdictional wetlands, open space and biological input impacts of the project for analysis of the potential impacts to biological resources that would be created by'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the extension of Shopkeeper Road, including surveys for special status plants and animals have the potential to exist in the footprint of this roadway as proposed, so there could be cumulative and unintended problems with this. This is straight out of the California coastal conservancies concerns.'",

Redwing Road, winged blackbird, a particular species of the marsh, ran song sparrow, common yellow throat, American Kestrel Osprey, Northern Harrier Harrier White Tailed Kite Buildings Savannah Sparrow. What? Run out of my time before I can list all the birds that we love.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I was at an art event over the weekend with people from the fourth and fifth District. And person after person knows about the great blue herons that fly through the buildings. Not over seven stories. I think that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You got to have some ways for the birds to get through. The great blue herons, the great egrets, the snowy egrets, the black crowned night herons, all of them, just individual people. And that's a representative our of our members that we value this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Michael Bond. I'm a senior principal with Studio 111. We're a group of practicing architects, landscape designers and urban designers with a focus on revitalizing the city. I want to share that we were retained by the Alamo Bay Partnership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We, as Cedar See support was being developed, created a design or a vision for the 90 acres that the Alamitos Bay Partnership owns. We actually took that on the road and shared it with a lot of the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we wanted to also thank Susie Price for her interest in understanding the perspective. We were looking at the site. We've heard lots of concerns tonight about traffic and housing, and housing will be significantly less in terms of affecting traffic than any other use proposed on the site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I wanted to provide some context. Keep in mind, Stony Brook Villas on Bellflower Boulevard, which has 471 units, has all four exits on Bellflower, and I've never seen congestion there. Marina Pacifica has 570 units with only one exit point on Second Street and that I've never seen Congestion, Channel Point Apartments, Pathways and Bixby Village and the'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I also want to mention Whalers Cove and the Belmont Shores Mobile Homes Estates totaling 395 units, both exiting on loins in the same location or approximate location. And there's no congestion there. Second Street has backups due to Caltrans controlling PCH.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Caltrans is focused on moving traffic and moving it fast by either having local control or updating the traffic equipment and synchronizing with our city.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much. That concludes public comment and the public comment portion of the hearing. What we will do is or public comment is closed. We'll go back to the Council for deliberation and for moving forward on the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So first up is Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I'm going to make a few comments and then we'll. There are multiple items associated with this particular hearing. So after hearing from my colleagues, I'd like to go into the specific items and motion those individually.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But before I talk about some of the points that were raised during public comment, I do have a couple of questions for city staff. There were some mentions regarding the general plan and the timing of the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I know the low Cerritos Wetlands Land Trust has expressed some concerns about potential concerns. Between CCF and the General Plan. I've had an opportunity to speak with the City Attorney and Development Services staff about this, but if you could address that, I think that would be educational for everyone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member. So over here at the staff table, I think we all agree with Ms.. BLOCK and the land trust that the general plan is an important document. That's why the city is investing considerable resources into updating that document.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the same time, we have a disagreement about whether that prohibits this evening's action. From a planning standpoint, the areas of change that we're talking about are and land use district seven, which is a mixed use portion of the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The uses we're talking about this evening are mixed uses. While some aspects of the general plan have aged, we don't find it to be meeting the standard for being inconsistent. Additionally, from a technical standpoint, I might can jump in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a charter city, we're giving given a certain amount of latitude that other cities that are general law cities are not given. So when we look at the sum of all the factors, there's no reason that we cannot proceed forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do believe that the action in front of you is consistent with the existing adopted general plan. We also agree with the comment that it's important to update our general plan, and that's why we're hard at work doing just that and look forward to bringing that item to council in the coming months.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, and I appreciate that. And later, when I make motions, I do intend to make a motion that's different than the staff's proposal in regards to the general plan. So I do want to hear from my colleagues, but I do believe having some assurance that there will be consistency and no conflict is important.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I want that to be part of the plan before we move forward. So I'll bring that motion, the specific language of my motion. There were some concerns regarding height and as the development services staff and I both know this, the email correspondence and the comments that have come back, some of them have lacked factual accuracy regarding'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the height issue. So can you please in regards to the hotel heights, Mr. Koonce, talk about what exactly the height limits will be and under what specific and narrow conditions a developer will be able to build a hotel at this location.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what sites?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. So there's as some of the speakers noted, there's a limited number of sites that are actually changing under this specific plan. And then the action in front of you, consistent with what the Planning Commission did, is a reduced intensity alternative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other change the Planning Commission did was they reduced height at the marketplace site. So for the marketplace site as well as the Golden Sail site, your height limit is five storeys. So for the other site, which is basically the Marina Pacifica shopping center as well as the properties on the other side, they're on the west'",
        "'speaker_0': 'side of PCH. So you've got the current Whole Foods location and that Regency Center and some adjacent property. On those limited properties, those two locations. If a hotel wanted to come in, they could, with the permission of the Planning Commission, reach a height of seven storeys on up to 15% on the of the site, and only if'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they included additional extraordinary public benefits beyond what is contained as a base requirement. So that could include a public pocket park that could include a sports or recreational facility that was open to the public. In addition to the hotel guests, it could include a performance venue, but it would have to be an additional public amenity and it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would be limited to the 15% and are limited to those two sites that, in the view of the Planning Commission, was the appropriate compromise.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if I can interrupt you one moment, because I think you're moving into another thought. In addition, one of the other factors that could be considered by the Planning Commission in determining whether or not to allow an application for seven storeys is a provision requiring moderate income and workforce housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that one of the options that's available for someone applying to have seven stories?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That could be an additional consideration, but it is limited to buildings that within that building contain a hotel use. And to finish that thought, the reason was brought up by a couple speakers that this is within the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the coastal zone includes all kinds of provisions. And we tend to think about the ones related to wetlands protection and coastal access, but it also includes provisions related to visitor accommodating and visitors serving use of. We as a city have an obligation to provide some type of incentive for possible hotel users in this area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The incentive that was available to us is providing them a little bit more height on a very small portion of it to select sites. And that's what's in front of the city council at this time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the seven stories we're talking about is limited to two sites and could only be 15% of a total project on those two limited sites.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it could only occur with the approval of planning commission, assuming that there are some of the amenities that you just include included in your list that are part of that project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I just want to a few things. This project also creates a wetlands mitigation fund, which in my experience is very unique in terms of development projects and proposals. Can you talk about that a little bit?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. So the most recurring common theme that we heard during the outreach process was that the wetlands are very important and we need to find a mechanism not only to not build on them, but to bring them back to do restoration work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think all the parties agreed that that's important, but that's also costly. So what we wanted to do was find a way to exact a fee, which in a compliant legal way on new development that would incrementally help pay for the restoration work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we've got a number of different wetlands out there in the area. There's some that are under private ownership and they would not be eligible for the use of these funds. But we have other wetlands that some are under the city's jurisdiction and some are under the Los Rito Wetlands Authority, which you set on their jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the issue for both those wetlands is a lack of funding to do things like invasive species removal, to correct the tidal flow, to do introduction of correct plant species. So in order to fund that work, what will happen is we will conduct a Nexus study and we will enact this fee in our research.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will be unique, at least here in the in the city, in the of cities in California. But we're confident that it's an important part of this plan because it's what we heard from the public was important. And as we develop that fee, we'll be sitting down with wetlands authority and with wetland stakeholders to make sure that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we have a proper plan for how those fees are going to be best utilized.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And I will be making an amendment regarding that as well in terms of how we move forward with that fee. But I appreciate the explanation in terms of timing of future developments. You know, I think a lot of times we hear comments about the the the density that's going to happen and the impact that that's going'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to have on traffic. Can you shed some light on what the realistic timing of future development is going to be in this seascape area?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. So this plan looks out all the way to 2060, but it also looks at tomorrow. So if the city council were to take a positive action this evening, the next step is for this plan to find its way to the California Coastal Commission, and we expect that certification process to take about a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So after that, there are properties that are less encumbered and might be subject to development in what we in the planning world consider the short term. So in the next five years, for example, there's some possibility that portions of the marketplace could be redeveloped.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there are other properties, such as the Marina Pacifica Shopping Center, that are encumbered by long term leases, including to a grocery store, which typically is a lease that cannot be broken. So that development is 20 years away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we're talking about is a plan that's going to suit our needs today, but also well into the future. And in terms of the amount of development that the folks will see in the next five years, it's not zero, but I would describe it as limited.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. So I want to start off by thanking staff, especially Christopher Coons, for his work on this project. I became involved in this project in 2014, actually, before I took office. And Ms.. Cantrell, I know you sent in an email out with some allegations about my my involvement in this case.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'd be happy to share with you that I've been involved with this project since before resuming or commencing office, and worked with the city attorney and the PPC to make sure that I could get involved in this project and be actively involved in this project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Happy to share all those letters with you. But all of that to say that I have worked really closely with staff from the first day until today, and I can tell you that never before have I experienced a staff member who has been such an amazing community partner.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's Christopher has met with everybody. I'm going to talk a little bit about the process in a moment. And the plan that is before you today is a much, much different plan than the plan that was initially proposed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'll talk a little bit about why that is. And that didn't come about in a vacuum. And it certainly wasn't something that was decided on at the Planning Commission meeting alone. The plan that's before you today come.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As a result of many, many discussions that city staff has had with community partners. And I'm really grateful for their leadership. This process actually started in 2004 with the Study Group and the old plan, which I'm very grateful to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Jan Hall, who's here today, was passed in 1977 and has lasted decades and served us very well, and it's no longer sufficient to meet the vision and the values of the current time. And that was the decision that was made in 2004, way before any of us were were involved in the decision making for the plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's tonight. That's before us tonight. This process started out for us in 2014 as CDEP and it was changed to see CIP. And it is obviously a very significant specific plan for the city of Long Beach and and for the third district because it is where we housed the most precious and greatest opportunity for wetlands restoration and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'preservation and also economic development for the city. The plan being considered tonight was developed after three years of outreach, including 50 community meetings and countless one on one constituent meetings, not just with city staff, but with myself and my team.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I cannot tell you how many times I've received telephone calls from people who are here tonight, some of whom actually went to the podium and said that they're opposing the plan, requesting a meeting with me the next day at the 11th hour, asking for my time, asking for me to meet with them repeatedly on the same issue'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And it's it's it's unfortunate to me that despite the shaping of the plan, based on their input, to get us to the place where at tonight that they're still in opposition, I certainly had hoped that we would have been able to acknowledge the progress that was made in the plan as a result of their input.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But as with all things I know, sometimes it's not. It's difficult to acknowledge the positive and much easier to highlight the negative. But in any event, staff's initial initial proposal on size up was 30% more density than it is now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the rich and original recommendation they made was 5 to 7 stories, not 3 to 5 stories. Where we are today is as a result of the input that we received, and I'm very grateful for where we have landed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This proposal fixes shortcomings and encourages consistency in expectations. The proposed plan corrects the shortcomings of the original plan. Preservation of the wetlands was not as much of a priority in 1977 as it is today. And I say that because of the focus that we have had on wetlands preservation, conceptual design and restoration that's happened over the last'",
        "'speaker_11': 'five years, that has not happened in this city before. And in fact, again, some of the speakers tonight, Miss Cantrell, had talked about there being no development on the wetlands since CDEP was created in 1977. And that's absolutely not true.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There has been development in the wetlands since 1977 that should have never happened on the wetlands. And this plan helps us restore that and make sure that doesn't happen. Under the old plan, residential and commercial developments on open wetlands were possible.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And indeed, we have less open wetlands now than we would have had had we adopted a plan to preserve them. The current proposal allows those areas to be protected and limits development opportunities sites. A specific plan created for this area establishes requirements for anyone who seeks to develop in this area, and those requirements are based on the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'desires and preferences expressed by the public. And yes, it's true, 200 people attending a community meeting certainly does not reflect the population of 500,000 in the city of Long Beach, but 200 people attending a community meeting, hundreds of people attending 50 community meetings is very significant in a particular district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have seen outreach unlike that anywhere else in the city that it takes. Having a specific plan removes the variability that we see with developers seeking variances and exemptions. Everything is set beforehand and developers have a reasonable expectations on what the community and the public want.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to thank some of the developers and their representatives who are here today, because I will tell you originally when they proposed plans three years ago, I made it very clear to them that the plans that they were proposing would not be something that I would support.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And although because of tonight's appeal, I was precluded from expressing a solid opinion on this case prior to tonight, I made it very clear that I would not support a 5 to 7 storey height limit. Or the density options that were provided in the original proposal, rather than looking at projects on a case by case basis which'",
        "'speaker_11': 'can be inconsistent and based on different owners are stronger lobbyists or other special interests. The characteristics of a particular project are difficult negotiations. Instead of all that varied variability, a specific plan sets all the requirements before anyone proposes a project and bases those requirements on the specific wishes of the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This particular element that's being proposed tonight is consistent with the vision that was laid out in 2004 and again when this process started with our stakeholder committee in 2014. Based on the vision developed by the community, this plan is forward thinking and embraces what we have stated in the vision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Examples of these elements include view corridors, public open spaces, wetlands preservation, wetlands, buffers of 100 feet, native planting, bird safe building treatments which I know the Audubon Society reached out to me specifically and requested and we made sure was included and most importantly, limits development to existing developed areas, meaning our wetlands will not be built upon.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Most importantly, this plan allows for the creation of a wetlands restoration and monitoring fund that every new development will have to pay into. Among the items expressed as priorities in the community vision, this plan will create a gateway into the city that is more reflective of the beauty and charm of this area and will provide a moderate'",
        "'speaker_11': 'amount of new housing as highlighted in the staff report, which is much needed for the entire city. And it will also enhance our shopping restaurants and other retail opportunities. The plan addresses height, in my opinion, responsibly and gradually, and I would have never approved the recommendation that was initially proposed by staff for 5 to 7 feet.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'From the beginning, I have expressed to city staff that I was looking for a lower height alternative. The reality that heights up to 12 stories were once considered for this area prior to my serving on this council. Continues to perplex me.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm not even sure how such a proposal would have made it to the Council for a vote. It's unclear to me because I cannot see a situation where my community would have supported that. This is not an area where downtown level heights make any sense and they don't reflect the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm very pleased that the Planning Commission recommendations and staff's recent proposal limiting the height to five storeys for almost all except two of the parcels of land. This height is reasonable and goes to great lengths to set up community benefits with art, park, open spaces and commitments to our wetlands in exchange for future developments to be allowed'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Additionally, if properties commit to even greater public benefits and are one of only a few properties further from the wetlands, they could build up to 15% of their property to seven storeys only if a hotel is included on that property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This would require major commitments from developers and huge investments in public outdoor benefits. Residents have again and again said they want like parks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Art view.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Corridors, wetlands support and many other things that we would need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will we would do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If we had that opportunity for any additional development. Large buildings that are seven stories tall is not something I would support. It is not something the community supports, and it is not something that this project allows for. Limiting heights in this area is extremely important because of the existing low height and keeping the area consistent and not'",
        "'speaker_11': 'creating a heavy burden of new residences, but also in preservation of wildlife needs and bird flight paths. Height has been a significant consideration at every stage of this process, and it has been reduced and reduced again many times, and requiring major investment in public outdoor amenities and open space in exchange for any expanded height.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's been a great deal of concern regarding traffic at this intersection, and rightly so. This is an area of major concern. The current proposal addresses this concern. The recommendation by Planning Commission reduced density by 30%, which I fully support, and I commend them on that recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This recommendation alone will reduce traffic impacts. Future development is also capped on a per acre basis based on peak vehicle trip generations. This is better, in my opinion, than a first come, first serve basis that might result in developments that are less thought out or not fully contemplated.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'More than 300 square feet of residential development has also been removed from the plan, further reducing maximum development and traffic connection of Shopkeeper Road to Studebaker Road is also part of this plan which will further reduce traffic pressures.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additional. We expect the plan will include many traffic design and engineering elements to alleviate traffic. These include breaking up super blocks to allow for access off of Second Street, adding multi-modal transportation options and infrastructure, and working with Caltrans to allow better city access to control controls over traffic signals at the intersection of Second and PCH.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is believed that changing the traffic signal timing alone can improve traffic flow by 5 to 7% from the current conditions. This is around the level when most motorists would start to see a difference in traffic flow. It's rare to get developers, property owners, environmentalists and residents together to collaborate on a single project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This project did that. It's also rare and frankly unheard of to have a final project that all of these entities would applaud together as a victory. And I don't believe that that will happen tonight. But to me, it is also a success because the public process led to a reasonable middle ground that does not lead to massive'",
        "'speaker_11': 'development tomorrow, but rather slow developments improving our community gradually over the next 40 years. This is not a max use of this area of land. It's a modest increase proposal which will allow redevelopment but do so in a way that is balanced and meets the needs of the communities along with preservation of the habitat.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This plan includes provisions from every stakeholder and group and in my opinion, effectively embraces the vision we have set out to accomplish in 2014. I want to thank the people who came out to speak in favor and opposed to the proposal tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Your input is valuable and whether you said it at the podium or not, we spent a lot of time together and your opinions and thoughts are reflected in this proposal. You know that even though you didn't say it, many of you with whom I met repeatedly after work late evenings at your request, you know that what you'",
        "'speaker_11': 'asked for is in this proposal. I know it and you know it. You didn't say it at the podium, but that's okay. This is a great proposal, and I ask my colleagues to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Council council member Councilor Maria Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I, too, want to thank everyone who came out today. If nothing else, it's your ability to engage in civic engagement with the city of Long Beach and anywhere you go. It's a democratic process, and that's what it's all about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm glad that you're here, and I'm glad that you shared your comments with us because that's how we get to work things out. The decisions behind all we hear are not always easy, and they haven't been. This one is one of those that is not easy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Some comments that were made that were inaccurate I have to address. Yes, I was. And I continue to be a member of the Coastal Commission and I did address the issue of the Belmont Pool and its height. That height is obviously a concern, and I know it will be a concern to the Coastal Mission Coastal Commission once'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it gets there. One of the things that I looked at immediately on this project was one of the heights that we're talking about and talking about five stories. So if if Chris can please answer by stories means what?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What would be at the maximum height of a five story building?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a typical five story building could be in that 55 foot range. It could go up to 60 feet, which is four stories at ten feet each and a larger 20 foot bass story. So similar to the existing Marina Pacifica condos that are just across the waterway from a portion of our areas of change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So currently as proposed, the height limitations would not be increased significantly other than it sounds intimidating that we have five storeys. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. In staff's view, it's not significant. It certainly was an area of great discussion and the heights have been adjusted down throughout the process in response to that great discussion we had with the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Earlier, the panel mentioned 80 feet. So I mean, we're nowhere near 80 feet. So we're I think we're we're in a good place. The other aspects of this plan that I was looking at is also in terms of those that are mainly concern to also the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the only reason I'm saying that is because included in this plan is a modification of the LCP. The local coastal plan, which will again go to the Coastal Commission, will actually will look at again, I had a unique opportunity here to have to bite at this apple in the sense of visiting and revisiting this project from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two different points of view. And so what I'm trying to do is try to get a sense of where we can possibly land in a good place. This plan right here, from what I can see, addresses all of the issues that would be concerning me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Councilmember Price has mentioned those. In fact, I have all of these bullet points and I could check them of a shoot as she was discussing them in terms of mitigating traffic. Also, one thing that was not mentioned, I was but it was it wasn't addressed in a very direct way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But Susie, the mere phrase it because remember Price and I both said on the wetlands lottery with wetlands authority and in that we also deal with some of the concerns that people have with the wetlands. One of the main things that also was brought up by the appellant was about the the size and the and the concerns'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of oil drilling there. Well, I can say that not many people know that the owner of those drills gave the city 100 acres of land to go towards wetlands, and it was donated to us and they only wanted to keep five acres of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have an additional 100 acres of wetlands that we can restore. And the best part I like about it is that there's going to be some money going into a restoration fund that will help in that restoration process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think it's a wonderful opportunity for us to make developers responsible for their development by giving back. I see a lot of also here that there's there's a public benefit to all of this. There's a public benefit in providing additional access and providing bicycle lanes and providing those opportunities for people to come to Long Beach and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'enjoy all the resources and amenities that we have to offer here. So having said all that, I think that they can support this project. I know that Councilmember Price has some additional amendments that she would like to make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We discussed some of those. I think I can support those. But hopefully when we come down to the vote that we could get the support of our colleagues to endorse and support this project to go out and talk to customers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're probably there'll be some additional changes coming because of, of course, commission rules and amendments and the and the Coastal Act that will come into play for that. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to chime in with a couple of thoughts. So, one, I you know, I remember when this conversation was before the last council and we followed it and it you know, and it's good to see how far the conversation has come.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's clear to me that, you know, the local councilmember Councilman Price, has put a lot of time into engaging, understand this issue, saying pretty much anything that would need to be said on this. You know, Chris, if this is indicative of the work that we're to expect with the without plan and some of the work there, we're'",
        "'speaker_0': 'really excited about that. But there's one area that I do want to you know, it's a bit it's a burning question on my mind and a lot of people's minds. And I noticed that there was some some focus on, like bird migratory patterns and bird activity, correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. Okay. So so maybe you can answer this question for me. Do Birds of a feather. Actually flock together. We're looking forward to finding out in our great spaces that we're going to create in this area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your time on this. Thank you. Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you for the laugh. Vice Mayor, I want to also echo Councilmember Price's comments. I sat on that side the last time the second PCH project was here and know very well that this is a very different project than was here before.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to say how much I appreciate all of those that have reached out to my office, which has been a small handful. And the list of comments that I have that have emailed in have all been in support as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know I've met with Mayor Bob and and a couple of other groups. And so, you know, I think that we've come a long way in talking about community benefit agreements, which wasn't a phrase that we even used before, that we've come a long way in trying to put together a process that is inclusive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And unfortunately, sometimes it's frustrating because it's hard to get everybody in. This is the story of tonight, right? Everybody to work together towards the same vision. And I do agree that this project does that. And I think that staff has worked really delicately in trying to move that process forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I won't take up too much time. Besides saying that I know that the councilmember is working with you all and there'll be some changes at the end. I look forward to hearing those, but I'm really happy to see that we've taken a longer step and a slower process and that there's still opportunities in the future to even'",
        "'speaker_2': 'make this project more fitting for the neighborhoods on each piece. So I welcome that process. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And so I want to make sure I'm driving the message home. So we'll start now. Okay. So this is the ordinance, the Long Beach Hospitality Workload and Safety Ordinance. That's our logo here that I'm sure you've seen and all of our social media outlets.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the next item we're going to talk about the various events we have in the city. The city of Long Beach has never looked better. And in fact, we actually have 2017 hospitality by the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're the third largest.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The hospitality industry is the third largest industry in downtown Long Beach. There's over 360 conventions and meetings. 1.4 million visitors in downtown alone through the busiest cruise terminal on the West Coast, 80% occupancy rate in downtown hotels, which is 15% percentage points higher than the national average.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That was a quote actually retrieved from the Long Beach Business Journal under hotel occupancy skyrockets. And in addition, there's over $660 million in estimated economic impact from the convention business alone as well. As far as annual attendance, we can see here, 1.6 million convention business, 1.5 for the Aquarium of the Pacific, also 1.5 for the Queen Mary'",
        "'speaker_10': ', and over 67 million attendees and tourists annually. And I know given all of this information, we can see clearly that the city of Long Beach, we're doing really well. And ah, we must also be cognizant of the physical effects and demands though of the industry's growth that has that they have on the hotel workers, particularly those who'",
        "'speaker_10': 'clean and service nearly 5000 hotel rooms across the city daily. The hospitality industry, by all accounts, is strong and growing on an annual basis and serves as one of the most visible industries in our city. However, the working conditions of these employees must be improved, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As a city, we have consistently invested in improving our convention facilities, negotiating the total return to the city of Long Beach for new hotel developments, and recruited countless organizations to bring their event business to Long Beach. Now it's time for the City Council to adopt an ordinance that puts workplace protections in place for our hotel housekeepers here'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in the city of Long Beach. As we go to our next slide. While Long Beach tourism grows rapidly, how can we support our Long Beach working women in our local hotels? A few points to add here. 85% of housekeepers are women in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As an industry, hotel housekeepers are increasingly subject to indecent behavior by guests. Per the Chicago and Seattle reports that we've seen, over 50% of housekeepers had experienced some sort of harassment. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 68% of sexual assaults go unreported.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Our Long Beach housekeepers endure exhaustion and intense workloads in an eight hour shift, heavy mattresses, exposure to germs, etc.. And in Long Beach, we have seen the annual supply of room rooms increase, while the hotel workforce shrunk by about 7%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, this is with almost 70 million visitors each year. Now, the policy at hand, it does about four things here, provides reasonable protections for women in the workplace, creates an achievable standard for humane workloads, empowers housekeepers to voice concerns without fear of retaliation, and for fulfilling Long Beach's promise to create a world class tourism industry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We know that in downtown alone, the Long Beach hotels that we have here at 100 rooms or more represent about 85% of all available hotel rooms. That was from the debate economic development report. And in Long Beach between 2007 and 2013, as I stressed earlier, over 11% were occupied.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hotel rooms increased by 11% and the workforce decreased by 6.9%, thus providing more workloads and more issue to our hotel employees. Now, here's a matrix that's really key to to look at. We see four of one of our major hotel chains, four of our hotel chains here, their rooms average size of their traditional room, daily room quota'",
        "'speaker_10': '. So it's about 14 to 15 rooms per day. And the square footage. We have from 3000 upwards of 4200 square feet. That's an average of about 3777 square feet that the city of Long Beach hotel workers are currently working in one day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So as we go on, I want to address what will not work in this policy. There has been a lot of discussion about what may work and some ideas out there, so I'll go over a few. There have been few reported incidents of sexual assault and harassment, so there is no problem.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One too many. Once one assault is one too many. In Long Beach, we cannot minimize women's voices in our hotels by demanding more reports. The importance here is that we're providing safeguards for our our hotel workers. To say that there is only one or two reported really is too many.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we should not have a threshold to say that there has to be 50 in order for us to see that there's a problem. We know that that's not true. The second point is let's work on the sexual harassment issue, but set aside the workload discussion for another day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The two items, in my opinion, need to coexist. As our city grows, both protections and workload improvements provide humane working conditions to our Long Beach working women. It's important that these two issues stay together. Thirdly, Seattle has 5000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Why can't we just keep it the same here in Long Beach? Based on a study of downtown Long Beach hotels, 4000 square feet, as I had showed you, represents less than a 10% change in workloads. We would be compounding the issue to add 1000 more square feet to this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Lastly, this is putting the safety of hotel guests against the safety of hotel workers. Creating a wedge between the safety of our hotel guests and our workers clearly is just an irresponsible statement. I don't know why a business would market themselves that way and say that has to be one or the other.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's unfortunate. And then I'll finalize with this approx. This is actually a 2014 police report. Approximately 5 minutes later, the suspect and I'm going to read this and it may be a little disconcerting to many of you. It will be, I'm sure, very uncomfortable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But this is what's happening in some of our hotels. Approximately 5 minutes later, the suspect moved the cart from the front of the room and entered the room. The suspect was unclothed and had a bath towel covering his lower torso.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The suspect asked about a late checkout and before she could answer, he dropped his towel and walked towards her. She said, I'll find out for you, but you need to leave the room. In the notes provided in the police report, it should be noted.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It was stated that it should be noted during my interview with her. She was still very distraught of the incident and was fidgety and appeared to be nervous. At one point she began crying and was unable to continue for a few minutes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this information I know we have talked about this issue for many years. I've been elected now for three and a half years like many of my council colleagues here. But we've been talking about this issue well beyond three and a half years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I felt and my colleagues, I want to thank them for being on the item with me. But I really did feel that it was at this point in time that we really need needed to address the concerns and move forward with this policy because it's not the political thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's the right thing to do. And as many of the hotel workers that I've met with both, you know, when I first got elected, you do a day with a hotel worker, and I did that. And to see the day in, day out, you know, the incredible workloads and to see the unpredictable situations that may occur from'",
        "'speaker_10': 'going into a hotel. This, I believe, is is a policy that is beyond reasonable. We are not only addressing the fact that we're making a Long Beach connection by addressing the fact that 4000 square feet already works for us because that's currently what our hotel workers are doing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But it also addresses the fact that there needs to be some some protections and safeguards for sexual harassment and assaults. Very reasonable and minor protections, I think. And I will say that personally, I've sat down with our hotel industry for many years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just recently I sat down with the Hospitality Alliance, the Long Beach Business Chamber. I met with the president. I've met with everyone involved, Steve Goodling from the convention bureau. I've met with many business interests, but I've also met with Unite here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I've met with hotel workers. And more importantly, the hotel workers is is what is really the root of the issue. Those individuals, these women primarily, are the ones that give a good first impression to many of the tourists that come in our city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They're the first line that many tourists and people see in our city. And I want to thank them for their service to this city. They often don't get a lot of thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to thank them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I don't think it's unreasonable to provide all of these stipulations in this policy. And quite frankly, I also read I told many people, I read investor reports myself, maybe it's the nerdy thing to do, but I've read them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And many of the investor reports for our hotels don't even suggest that labor issues or unionization or any sort of thing like that would be a detriment to business. In fact, I think it reaps more benefits to provide safeguards to your to your local, to your hotel work force than it would provide negatives.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Seattle, in fact, for the first quarter of their fiscal year, 17, received a jump in about 12% of their adjusted room revenue. And so I see the benefits for cities, for a city on the waterfront where a city that has so much diversity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And now it's our time to provide the dignity and respect back to those hotel workers that do everything they can to make sure that our city works at its best. So thank you. I suggest I want to just offer as well to the colleagues that signed on with me.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I thank them for their work. I want to thank my city staff and my city hall team for for all their research and work. And I also offer this to the other colleagues that are not on here, as I really wish that we can reflect on what has occurred so far.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I hope that we all make the best decisions for our city, not for ourselves personally. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. So. Okay. So you just answered my question. So you made the motion as submitted, correct, councilwoman? Okay. And so the second of the motion is Councilmember Ginny Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, everybody, this has been a long time coming. And I want to say how much I appreciate everybody's commitment to partnering and sharing your conversations. And especially I want to thank my colleague, Councilmember Gonzalez, for leading on this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been here before, guys. We've been at this moment before. And so I'm excited and I'm really proud today to be standing with hotel workers and with women, because I've been standing for a long time. And you guys know that we've been at this point before when business said, we can't do that, we can't give workers a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'living wage because we'll go broke. We can't take another dollar out of the bank because we'll leave. We can't do that or they won't come and build here. Today, Long Beach is thriving. It's strong. Our downtown has multiple new hotels coming in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is the day for us to continue to say we can do it and we can do it the right way in a measured way. That is the Long Beach way, right? Because in Long Beach we don't just say, hey, you know what, we're going to pass a minimum wage and we're going to do it our way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'today at the highest rate away immediately. No. During the minimum wage talk, we sat down with everybody. Right. And we actually voted on something that was a middle ground. And I think that we've had this item out there for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've had this item since that hotel worker went to PD. I got to meet with her back in 2014. And that moment where when she was crying, doing the police report. What? Did it feel like right after? And how much time did she have to sit with the things that have happened to her?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is not about the union. This is not about our political futures, guys. This is about women coming up here. And I'm sure we'll hear today their stories. And that's the one thing before we start public comment, two things I really want to echo is that those are personal stories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for us to ever tell a woman that her reality was not her reality is not okay. It's not okay. For us ever to say, you know what, it's not as bad as you thought, because what I have in front of me is from the women's shelter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they have a long list of reasons why women don't speak out against sexual assault. The numbers are stark, guys. 15 to 35% of women actually report their domestic or sexual abuse. And there are lots of reasons. RICHARD Retribution, fear of what might happen at home, immigration status.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The list goes on and on. As somebody who has personally been sexually assaulted 14 years ago. It took me three years to tell somebody, anybody I didn't even tell my best friend. And whether or not it's something, someone tapping someone's sign and doing that multiple times and someone saying, shake it off, we've got to get back to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'work. It wears on you. And I know that we'll hear from people about the emotional impacts of that. And this policy is about a vision that says that Long Beach, we're thriving and we can do better. We've got great managers there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've got great staff. But we have to recognize that there's a problem in an industry and we can fix it. We can be the leaders with measure. In a year later, we have 7% increase in profits. So this is a city that can do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They can say, we stand with women that can say we can have an industry that's going to thrive. No dollar is worth too much to make sure that women every day do not get scared or worried or have panic attacks before they knock on a bedroom door by themselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am excited that this policy has a vision. It fits the needs of Long Beach. It's measurable, and it's something that we can all be really proud of. So as we're continuing to thrive, when we're talking about our conventions in downtown and we've got great Steve Goodling, who does a fantastic job.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He can say, you know what, we are one of the few cities. There are others. There's Chicago, there's Seattle, there's New York. There are other cities, guys that have done this. But we are one of the few cities that you can come to on the water and have an awesome, awesome time and know that workers in every'",
        "'speaker_2': 'single hotel feel safe and respected and dignity is treated to them. So I'm thrilled to hear from you guys today. I hope that those two arguments around sexual assault and the idea that this is just a union ploy are taken out of the conversation right away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So before I close, I will address the union conversation. Right. Because I know that we'll hear that. We heard it about a month ago. To be clear, the sexual assault piece, we want to make sure that every hotel is included in that, that that is something that every single hotel has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When people say in the letter that we got from the chamber, it says, just come to us and talk to us. Right. Just come and talk to us. Well, people have people have come in and talked. And there's class as a class action lawsuits that have happened in this city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm not going to name which hotels or anything. Class action lawsuits. There's been unfair labor practices filed time and time again for things like interrogating workers concerning union activities, making statements, equating support for the union disloyalty, prohibiting workers from accessing certain floors, etc., etc., that have been won at at the level that it needs to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'won out, that have taken years. And so this policy is not about that because workers have decided to unionize. They've gone through a process. This is about creating an industry across the board that has the highest standards, where women can walk in and walk out and feel proud every single day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm excited to hear from you guys. It is the day that I stand with workers, that I stand with women, and I really hope that I can count on my colleagues to stand with women as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So unless there's any objection. Great. So we will go ahead and do that. So we will now open it up for public comment on the hotel item, please. And so please again, begin lining up here. And again, if you're outside, we will have an opportunity, of course, to let folks come in as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We will. We will go ahead and. Okay. All right. Well, I know that the middle is getting a little crowded, so if you take a seat, well, once this line goes down, we will allow everyone else to to come back up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please, everyone else, just take a seat. The lines for right now. Allow us. Please take a seat. I would appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. I want to start with three and I go down to two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, going to be good public comment, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've got to convince you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Good evening. Thank you, Mayor. City Council Member Staff Jeremy Harris, senior vice president with the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce here tonight on behalf of our over 850 members. These members include hospitality partners, many of whom you will hear with hear from tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But more importantly, we're here tonight on behalf of our members in the Long Beach business community and all industries. Because tonight's item is just bad public policy. Long Beach hasn't experienced an unbelievable economic rebirth and has risen out of the recession, which has been noted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thanks due in large part to your vision, Mayor, and the development community. So the question is why slow the momentum down? Because if this proposed ordinance is allowed to move forward. That is exactly what's going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The chamber, for years, if not decades, has made it a point to ensure the government doesn't hinder the progress of the private sector. In fact, one of these areas we focus on this year, and I quote, mitigate costly business regulations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What does that simply mean? Or just an excerpt from our policy manual for this year. We will protect business sectors that currently drive the local economy and seek ways to support their efforts, oppose any state, county, local or other governmental agencies, mandated business regulations that put Long Beach area businesses at an economic disadvantage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But since we're not just in the business of saying no, it further reads we will secure reasonable solutions in order to balance business interests with the creation of new regulations. So at a minimum, we've asked in the past to compromise when we cannot agree.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tonight's item is example, an example of the exact opposite. There's no compromise here. Our members and partners will speak later tonight on exactly what is at stake to their civic energy industries and mainly the hospitality industry and the negative impacts on our area hotels.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe the greater issues at stake here are the leadership of the city is on the verge of passing something that will set an example not only in our region but throughout the nation. A bad example. I ask the question, why does Long Beach want to be the forefront of passing bad public policy and baseless facts and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'statistics that one entity or group has portrayed through a false narrative? That group has not reached out to us. We've done all the educating through our Long Beach Hospitality Alliance. It was only a month ago we hear before you providing data and facts about how the industry works and necessary safety protocols that are already in place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We talked about the hospitality industry as one of already heavy, heavily regulated. The state and federal levels once again, others will dove deeper into this issue. The language that is included in tonight's item is wrought with misinformation and looks too heavily regulated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Private industry where the government has no business and being. And we need to ask ourselves, is this the kind of city we want to be known for? This potential policy penalizes industry that's provided good paying jobs, help put Long Beach on the map through its total dollars and provides a positive local economic impact wherever hotels are located'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And with this agenda item tonight, the city wants to say thank you on behalf of our chamber members, the business community. I urge you to oppose this idea.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Commissioners. Okay. Thank you. Next Speaker Please.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Do. It took a lot for me to stand here and listen to that. Take control, sister. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez, for your courage and for your leadership. So members of the city council who have the same courage. Thank you, Mayor Garcia.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'you to be in. But in all honesty, it is much more significant to all of the Long Beach housekeepers and immigrants who are forced to live in fear, fear of the whims of a pathological president, fear of what is on the other side of a hotel guest door, fear of having an unreasonable workload demanded of you and'",
        "'speaker_13': 'not having the power to say, Yeah, basta, enough is enough. Tonight, these brave men and women have stood up. They have pushed to make their voices heard. And tonight they look to you, the mayor and the City Council of Long Beach to match their.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Courage. In this political climate, we are all faced with hard decisions and we have to choose sides. Tonight, you have the power to tell these immigrant workers and their families that you are with them and that you are watching their back.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I urge you to take the lead and stand on the side of women who work so hard every single day and their immigrant families. Gracias.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Has grown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To meet the needs of visitors from across the world. These women are the economic engine driving the hotel industry in Long Beach. The Bible is full of passengers calling for the fair treatment of workers by their employers and showing how exploitation is against our Judeo-Christian faith tradition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Today. You all have a decision to make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will you stand only on the side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the rich and powerful of our city? Or will you listen to the voices of those that are most vulnerable, the voices of these very hard working women? I would like to think that we Long Beach residents will look back on your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Decision as the day that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City leaders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Stood on the side of justice and righteousness by standing with these women. And I would simply add that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The very few unionized hotels we have in Long Beach, where the rights of workers are observed and they are treated with dignity and respect and given a living wage and decent working conditions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those hotels are thriving.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so will the other hotels continue to do better and thrive more if they give rights to our workers. Thank you for having me.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Members of the council. My name is Rusty Hicks. I'm the executive secretary treasurer of the L.A. County Federation of Labor. And I appreciate the opportunity to stand before you and ask you and call upon you to support this important policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My friend from the Chamber stood before you and said that Long Beach had been rejuvenated, that its economy was thriving in large part due to the policies of this body. And unfortunately, there are some in our community they are being left out of that that prosperity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The workers that are paying the price in abuse, whether it's inhumane workloads or sexual assault, and both bring indignity to their work. And it was Dr. Martin Luther King that said that all work has dignity, and that includes the work of a housekeeper of women here in here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so you have the chance tonight to really live out the words of of Dr. King, to stand with these workers and support them in their in their struggle. These policies are sweeping the nation, whether it's in Seattle or Chicago or other cities to follow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I only hope that Long Beach will be the next in line. I know there's been a lot of back and forth about this particular policy, but the choice before you, in my view, is really pretty simple. It's pretty straightforward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the question of where you will stand. Will you stand on the sides of workers or will you turn your back on them? I know many of you have spent your careers fighting and working with and supporting communities just like this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hope you will continue that work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tonight and support this policy and pass it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And implement it as quick as possible.'",

Dear Mayor Garcia and Honorable Counsel, thank you for your consideration of an ordinance that puts workplace protections in place for the men and women in the hospitality industry. And I strongly encourage your full support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have been fighting alongside our brothers and sisters in the hospitality industry for years. They are the individuals who welcome us when we first arrive and provide warm and satisfying experiences while we are away from home. Sadly, we have heard all too many stories about hotel guests who violate the standard code of conduct and sexually victimize our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'housekeepers. We must do better to protect our workers as one of the most desirable tourist destinations in the United States. The city of Long Beach must be a leader in protecting hotel workers from inappropriate sexual advances and burdensome workloads by requiring safe and humane workspaces.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'As Long Beach thrives and grows, so does the hospitality industry in the city. And while we welcome, welcome that growth, it must not be on the backs of our hotel workers.

        "'speaker_3': 'Of Clue Empower. Honestly, sir, you're my first speaker. My heart is pounding because as a former hotel worker, I can tell you that that is not a false narrative. The work that. I did as a hotel worker. The amount of abuse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I really can hardly speak at your denial of my reality and the reality of all of these women and others who have spoken about what it is like to be a service person in this industry. It requires long hours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It requires safety issues. And I ask you tonight, as a person, speaking of my own experience and from the point of view of a pastor, it is the right thing to do. I do not. I find the argument of regulations to be ludicrous.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are regulations in every field to protect your workers rights and their dignity. This is not an add on. This is a requisite for the dignity of these women who service each of our visitors and all those who who are requiring YouTube to have a wonderful place to stay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who is the first person that you meet? The woman who is in your hotel room, who smiles and then makes it clean? And I, as a person who goes to hotel, the first thing I check on is how clean is my room?'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Please do the right thing. These women need and deserve your protection. They need and deserve your dignity by giving it to them. By dignifying their requests. And and above all, we are here to respect and give it to each other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I speak to you from experience, but I also speak to you as a pastor. Harmony, respect and dignity creates economic benefit. And in that we have a quality of life. So please do the right thing. Thank you.'",

And but equally what I'm troubled about is the way this was advertised to protect immigrants and protect this group or that group goes back to all lives matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Does it make any difference whether or not the person was an immigrant? Or born here in the United States, that third generation, fourth generation family. There's some people who like working in the hotel industry, in the restaurant industry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They deserve the respect and the protection. If that panic button, if it rises to that level or if that's what is needed, that should be put in place, period. But again, I go back to it is not a case of being an immigrant.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'This will have immediate impacts on our entire business community. Our hotel and hospitality members can speak to you about their business models and the lengths to which they have gone to in order to ensure safe work environments for their employees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tonight, my goal is for you all to respectfully understand the potential consequence of etc. ordinance with the language as stated, will have not only to the hospitality industry but other sectors of the local economy. The item before you is merely political.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not even close to being good public policy. The chamber in the Long Beach business community have heard this tune before when a particular group or in this case an organized union cannot force its will upon the private industry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They look to the folks such as yourselves to provide the answer when it should be decided by the market in the private sector.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The language on the agenda item is riddled with half truths and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Potential legal ramifications. But the more troubling issue about the item is the blatant potential overreach of local government to enact and regulate an industry that is already heavily regulated through the state and federal levels of government. Unless you start the collective bargaining process, of course, that begs the question what industry is next?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As the mayor and council know, Long Beach is currently undergoing a renaissance as it comes to development increase in the local economy and revitalization through many of the neighborhoods and business corridors. Business in Long Beach has faced its fair share of increased regulations and costs just in the past two years through the minimum wage increases and increased'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sales tax to our retailers. No one is saying tonight that business should not be regulated. We're just saying it should be done with collaboration and much discussion based on the facts and not on the will of one entity not getting their way in the private market.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I urge you to oppose this agenda item and protect the industry that provides so much economic value to Long Beach because we know if this passes, other industries are next and that is just setting a bad precedent for the city and the local economy.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for being up. Now we're going down to 2 minutes. Thank you, Mayor and council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Members, for this opportunity to comment. My name is Lynn Moore Feldman with the California Hotel and Lodging Association. I'll just be commenting on some of the legal and related concerns we have with the proposed ordinance. As a preliminary matter, the proposed square footage requirement is completely arbitrary, with no foundation and scientific studies or analysis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Which leads me to a second point. Local government is not an appropriate body for these standards. In California, Labor Code Section one for 2.3 expressly provides that Carlos Jazz Standards Board shall be the only agency in the state authorized to adopt occupational safety and health standards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Therefore, this ordinance would be preempted by state law. In fact, Carlos, the Standards Board has been looking at this issue since 2012 when the same labor organization that represents a number of our hotel employees here in Long Beach petitioned the Standards Board to adopt a square footage limitation following numerous advisory committee meetings, soliciting expert testimony of scientists'",
        "'speaker_4': ', industrial hygienist, ergonomics, economist and others. The Standards Board released a proposed standard that notably does not contain a square footage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Limitation and identified.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Such quotas has not appropriate in the workplace standards and something that is better left to collective bargaining. Equally troubling is maintaining a blacklist of guest against whom mere allegations have been made, sharing that list with employees and prohibiting such a guest for at least three years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These provisions violate the due process rights of the hotel guests under the California Constitution and the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution will embroil both the hotels and the city in years of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Expensive and time consuming.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Litigation. These provisions are also unnecessary as the Fair Employment Housing Act already makes hotel employers liable for sexual harassment committed by third parties, including hotel guests. For these reasons, if this proposed ordinance is poorly drafted, not scientifically based, and is preempted by state law and raises significant legal and constitutional issues.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'It doesn't matter if the company bring you all the tools that you need, but if you didn't practice, that is nothing we can do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And another thing that I want to mention, sometimes the room attendant never put the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cart in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Front of the doors. Like our manager.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mentioned every single day, you have to put the cart in front of the door. So that way you're not put yourself in dangerous. So if you want to be in danger, you're not going to like you going.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're not going to do that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Currently, I am working at the restaurant scene in the airport. I have spent my career working in the housekeeping department and work and worked my way up to a manager position. I love my job and my employer provide a safe working environment where I have never felt that my safety was at risk.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My employer offer 24 hours a day confidential assistance in-house, offer many training classes. I have completed many of these classes, including ways to identify and report sexual harassment in my over 30 years of experience. I have never experienced harassment or have felt threaten it in any way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have not asked for a la for housekeepers, the loves. We have work. My employer has brought really safe safety and we has employees not. I am here today because I truly believe that this ordinance will not help us.'",

I'm not sure I've ever sat through a hearing on a measure to improve labor standards for low wage workers in the hotel sector or anywhere else, whether it's minimum wage or wage theft, where lobbyists or managers from the industry did not claim that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if it went forward, it would cripple the industry. The sky would fall or it would be illegal for one reason or another. And those claims rarely stand up to scrutiny. Tonight is no different. Briefly, I'd like to respond to a few things I've heard tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, the Hotel Alliance has claimed that repeatedly in an op ed in a memo to counsel at least three times tonight, that that the measure would create a blacklist that would bar guests from staying in hotels. That's simply not true.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's nothing like that in the measure. It simply would require that hotels advise workers that if they're being asked to clean a room where a guest is staying and that guest has previously been reported to sexually harass or assault a worker or is a registered sex offender that the worker be notified so that they can enter that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'guest room with some caution? It would not require that any guest never prohibit any guest from staying in any hotel anywhere. That's simply not true. Not true. And it's just a red herring. There's also been representations made that there's a preemption issue that's also simply not true.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cities absolutely have the right to regulate wages and hours and basic labor standards as they are here with the voluntary overtime provision and the premium for workers who are made to work more than a reasonable workload. Emeryville has had a measure just like this on the books since 2008.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If it was truly illegal, it would have been challenged and overturned. The measure is hardly arbitrary. As other speakers have mentioned, three of five hotel rooms in downtown Long Beach are already cleaned by workers whose workloads meet the standard or just above it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Next speaker, please.'",

I'm also a member of the California Faculty Association at Cal State Long Beach, where I teach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for this opportunity to clear up a misconception of the opt out clause for hotels that have collective bargaining agreements. As you may know, collective bargaining agreements are mutually negotiated by the hotel employer and the workers at that hotel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was language included measure, and that was overwhelmingly approved by voters in Long Beach in thousand and 12, an ordinance which seems to have a very positive impact on the industry. We know that workers at some unionized hotels have successfully negotiated collective bargaining agreements with complex clauses to ensure workers have reasonable workloads and humane working conditions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Laws and policies should not appear with that process or these agreements. What is important to keep in mind is voice and choice. The collective bargaining process allows workers to negotiate on an agreement that is consistent with their needs and priorities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This includes workload, health and safety, wages, wages, ways to balance work and family personnel, our personnel and sick days mechanism to solve problems, among many other issues. We know that workers have a guaranteed right to form and join a union if they choose to do so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have the right to sit at the table with their employer as an equal to discuss all aspects of the workplace. The collective bargaining super session clause preserves that right. I urge you to vote yes on this ordinance.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not here to give you data, sir. I'm not here to tell you it's not good for the city. I'm not here to tell you that. Most of what we have heard does not have any basis. I'm not here to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To ask you even why hundred rooms or less or more? 100 rooms. Just. I'm not here to ask you that all. All I'm here to tell you that we work really hard to make sure that our associates are taken care of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And most of them are here in support of that. And I do appreciate when you make your choice, all these things that you've heard on our side. I consider and I thank you a lot.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'When these things happen to them. The guest is not always right. They came here to work because they heard that in America they could be given a fair chance if they worked hard. But they did not imagine that they would be struggling under intolerable workloads.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Our hotel industry needs to face up to the fact that it is their workers who keep their industry successful and thriving and humming. They could not exist without the energy and work that these women and men put out every day.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'No person should clean more than 12 or 13 hotel rooms a day and still function at the day's end. And remember, this is not just changing sheets and washing a sink and a toilet and vacuuming a room. Think about how you sometimes leave a hotel room when your vacation or your business trip is over.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'Just as you and I do. My parents were immigrants, and I know how hard they worked to give me and my two sisters an education. These workers need Claudia's law. They have a right to humane workloads and to be compensated for overtime work.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'In my Bible, the last requires that we help and protect our workers, even to paying them before we pay ourselves. Our faith traditions demand that we confront injustice no matter where it happens and to whom it happens. This is a moral issue, not a politics.'",

I was surprised that only one person works a floor in many conference hotels. Two people are working the floor and working in twos does provide a measure of safety.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Those opposed will claim that there are minimum reports of sexual assault on the job. The truth is, these incidents are often underreported and no charges are levied because of fear. If fearing for their own safety isn't bad enough, these women are extremely overworked.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While the number of hotel rooms in the city have increased, the workforce has decreased, resulting in larger and larger workloads for these women.

        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to acknowledge I have a number of letters that were submitted to the clerk. So I do want to acknowledge the Human Relations Commission for expressing their support tonight. I think acknowledge Supervisor Hahn, Senator Laura and both Congress members that represent Long Beach, Alan Lowenthal and Annette Berrigan for expressing support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I thought it was important that we acknowledge that this has been a conversation that's taken place for quite some time. I do remember, you know, the initial conversations of this prior to when I took counsel, I spent some time as a chief of staff to former councilman Steve Neal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I remember this was a conversation in the downtown and and I do remember sort of the last council beginning these conversations. So I haven't had an opportunity to sort of watch and follow. And I do want to just acknowledge and take a moment just to acknowledge the two council members that represent downtown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Janine Pearce and Lena Gonzalez. And you know, Lina, just want to say thank you for taking the courage of stepping up. This conversation is not an easy one. And and sometimes it's more convenient to let the conversation come to you.'",

I think it's an opportunity for us to cut the politics for a minute and get to the policy and actually take a look and talk with our city attorney and talk with our council members and get'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to the meat and the crux of this issue. So I'm going to start my comments just talking about the issue that's come up the most aside from me. And I do want acknowledge the, you know, the issues related to women and buttons and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I want to start with the square footage now. The presentation I saw tonight. You know, I've seen some of these numbers before, the numbers that shows an average among some of the bigger hotels, larger hotels about how many square feet people clean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also, you know, I am here every year when we receive the presentation from the Convention and Visitors Bureau on how tourism is is growing and thriving. And we do pay attention and that is something we're proud of and we pay attention to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the square footage conversation, if the average what I saw tonight and what I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, councilmember, but it said something like 3800 square feet was that was the average. And I saw, you know, one hotel was maybe just over 4000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some were just below 4000. But you know, the conversation about economic impact, I want to sort of dig into that a little bit. If the square footage cap is 4000 square feet, that means you lock it in what it is today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it guarantees that as tourist, tourism and industry grows, that that additional economic benefit is not squarely placed on the backs of workers, but rather it sets a cap on work load and says we should hire additional staff in order to accommodate this economic growth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if the if if the 4000 square feet is average today, there shouldn't be an economic impact today. The economic impact should be realized as economic benefits are realized. So what it says is, as we grow, we're not going to place that burden.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are going to share in the benefit in higher additional workers. Now that I can support. Ensuring that as we grow, we hire additional people. And that is an opportunity for me to say, Brother, I never met you before, but what you said about doing the hospitality, training and all of that, that makes sense to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That says let's create the economic opportunities in the future. As the Olympics come to Long Beach and these other things happen. What message do we send to the world? What message do we send to the women of the world?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's a strong message to say, as we grow, we keep our local folks in mind and we hire additional people. That's the way I'm breaking this down. I know there will be, you know, contrary opinions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that's the one issue that I haven't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Heard a specific response to. You know, economic impact to me means they're hiring additional people. So where is that threshold? Where is that threshold? You know, where the square footage is of 4000? The data shows me 4000 is above average.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That means there shouldn't be an impact here. So I spent the moment talking about that. They don't want to just acknowledge, just in general, I know how difficult it is to have conversations. And and I want to acknowledge the people who did come down to the dais and share their stories.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I acknowledge those stories. As a son of a domestic worker, my mother was a home care worker. She cleaned. She took care of people. All right. I heard someone mention sharecropper. That's something I'm really proud of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can trace my lineage back to sharecropping and to slavery.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I acknowledge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. You know, I you know, I'm a father, two daughters, two Afro-Latino daughters that are beautiful. And that's my pride. And nobody better than, you know, Rick's List. But the reality is to say that and to also somehow diminish the evidence that exploitation of workers in this country or the history of that says that we are not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'acknowledging our past. Now, whether this happens in your hotel or not. That does not prevent me from saying What can we do to prevent it from happening in the future? That is our responsibility. We should create policies for the future, the next generation of workers as they come in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, we can debate all night about what happens to the middle class, which is getting richer, poorer, getting poorer. But the reality is the service industry needs to be supported. These are the most vulnerable workers. And it is our job as as, you know, as as a regulatory agency, as a government to take that into consideration'",
        "'speaker_0': '. This is not and, you know, city attorney, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is not something that's absolutely unheard of. Truck drivers regulate work load. Nurses regulate workload. Public safety officials regulate workload. This isn't something that is inappropriate in front of city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd rather get down to the actual nuts and bolts of the policy and and get the feedback from the city attorney. I'd rather get to that point and cut through the politics. So I'll conclude. My. My, I'm gonna sleep well tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like the opportunity to actually vote on this item if there's other things going to happen. Substitutes now that I actually want to vote on this item tonight. So I want to hope I hope that we do get to that point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do want I don't what I want to be able to do that. And I know I want to close and just say I hope, you know, I want to sleep well tonight with my daughters, with my wife and and sort of this is one of those moments where you just have to have a gut check on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'where you are. I acknowledge the I acknowledge the impacts, potential perceived impacts of the community to communicate it to us. Let's actually go forward. Tear off the Band-Aid. Start this conversation that will evaluate what that is and see if we can mitigate or talk about the economic impact in the city, because that's a conversation I want to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have. But thank you again to all of you who who spoke up in this motion has my support. Thank you. And just before we got to count some of your anger, I just to clarify also, Mr. City Attorney, so the motion would be, I believe, councilwoman to the city attorney to craft an ordinance, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, I mistakenly added city manager. So if I can just amend that to say city, to direct the city attorney to create this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for Mr. Parking, just for the public so that we they understand the process. So essentially the motion would be for you to craft an ordinance. And then the ordinance, of course, would then come back to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. Through the discussion this evening, we would clarify the motion and any amendments, and then we would craft an ordinance and bring it back for a first reading and then a second reading, and then it would go into effect subsequent 31 days after it's signed by the mayor after second reading.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember. Your income.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank all of you for sticking around, staying here. I know it's late into the evening, and I know it's bedtime for Rex, so I hope Richard has a good night tonight. Little known fact is that I have a son and a daughter in law who work in the hotel hospitality industry'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So this issue was a no brainer for me to get into because I do very much care about their safety and where they work and how they work. There was a person earlier who spoke and threw out two statistics that out of 5000 rooms that were cleaned over the last year, there were only two reported instances.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of those two were my son or my daughter. That's too much. That's enough. There was also some commentary made about this is bad public policy. Well, when that public policy deals with employee safety. Is it bad policy when that public policy deals with the public interest, when that public policy deals with civil rights and employee health'",
        "'speaker_1': '? Is that public bad public policy? I don't think so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There were arguments made.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we were dealing with Measure N and raising the minimum wage for hotel workers. There was this big discussion about Chicken Little. This guy is going to fall. Tourism is going to drop. Hotel rooms are going stay empty.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The economic impact will be tremendous to see Long Beach. We've actually heard quite the contrary, read after measure and pass. We've had a burst of growth and a burst of economic interest in Long Beach, but yet employee workloads increased and employee hiring went down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But yet we still benefit from measure in because because salaries went up and has been steady. We're looking at a future where we're building more hotels, which means more rooms, which means more conventions, which will affect our ability to house people when 2028 comes to town.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there is going to be a huge, huge economic interest and economic benefit to the city of Long Beach. Are we going to be prepared for that? That's what we're talking about. So what kind of future do we want for our employees, for for our hotel workers, for our housekeepers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want to secure a future for them that is going to be violence free, that is going to be making them happy to go to work, to want to come to work. And finally, there was a discussion earlier made about the possible loss of hope to our philanthropy, to smaller nonprofits, because this would affect the economic bottom'",
        "'speaker_1': 'line of our hotels. I hope that does not happen. I hope that is not true, and I don't think it will be. But it had to be stated because there's a genuine concern out there that if hotels don't thrive and don't make money, their ability to support nonprofits is going to go down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope not, and I don't think it will, because this measure that we're dealing with today, the ordinance that we're working with today, is going to actually strengthen us. It's going to strengthen our hotel. It is going to provide them with greater opportunity to hire more people, to do more beds, to do more work, and to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not only that, the best part of our tourism industry is when you go anywhere in this city and you're greeted by a hotel worker, a service worker, a police officer, a firefighter, and they give you a greeting with a smile that's going to want you to come back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not stay away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm very supportive of this measure as it is, and I hope it stays that way. And I hope my colleagues my colleagues can support that as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much. We have Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to my colleagues for speaking and thank you to my colleagues who brought this item forward. And, Councilwoman Gonzalez, for bringing this item forward and for giving us the presentation. I know that this is something that she feels genuinely passionate about, and I respect that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think that there are a lot of issues that were raised tonight that are incredibly worthy of consideration and talking about and I want I want to talk about those a little bit. I also want to thank the folks from Unite here because they have taken the time to meet with me and they've educated me on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the topic and they've asked me a lot of questions. And from day one, I've been very honest with them about my concerns. And I have to be honest, I still have those concerns today about aspects of the proposed ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I do have a few questions and I think I'll direct them to city staff to the extent that city staff can answer them. But then if city staff can't answer them, I think I want to raise the questions and hear from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So in reading the the item that was filed tonight, it looks to me I know that Councilman Gonzales in her presentation talked about the issue of safety and the issue of controlling or limiting or regulating workloads. Go hand in hand.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I personally am having difficulty with that nexus and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues of what that nexuses. And what I mean by that is. If we were to put all the safety measures into place, the panic buttons, the notices, the every type of support, the training, everything that we can do, which I think is'",
        "'speaker_11': 'absolutely important. The public safety aspects of it, I think are of zero issues with them. I'm completely 1,000% in support of the panic buttons, doing everything that we can to make sure that women and men are safe in their work environment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that's really important. But reducing the workloads, so limiting the number of square feet that a person cleans, will that make them less likely to be the victim of sexual assault? And that's what I don't understand. And so I would like to hear how how is that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that is it because if if they're cleaning more, then they don't have I don't understand if they're cleaning less than how are they more able to prevent a sexual assault from happening? So I can't see the Nexus.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I just so that's just something I'm putting out there is a concern because I think to me, in my opinion, they are I understand they're being brought as a as a package of issues. But it's you know, we have a test that we do and legal analysis that we say.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But for this, that wouldn't happen. So can we say but for them working.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More square.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Footage than they should, a sexual assault wouldn't happen. We can't say that. So to me, whether you're cleaning 2000 square feet or 7000 square feet, you still have the same risk of coming into a room with a man who or a woman or anybody else who is drunk, has bad intentions, is disrespectful of you, as Anita pointed'",
        "'speaker_11': 'out, is is on a vacation or something. And that has no inhibitions. Whether you're cleaning 2000 square feet or 7000 square feet, that client doesn't know the difference of that. So if they're going to attack you, it doesn't matter how many square feet you're cleaning, they're still going to attack you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think we really need to be thinking and maybe I'm missing it. I'm more than happy to listen, but I just don't know what that nexus is. I'm sure I am. So that's why I said I'm looking forward to listening and having a civilized debate about it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I really would love to hear more about that. The question that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would have for our.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Police department, I guess, and I don't know if the chief is here, Chief, I know there was a staff report produced with some data based on questions that council was asking. And I think one of the questions that was asked was what are the number of sexual assaults that have been reported?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And look, I'm a prosecutor. I know that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sexual assaults go unreported. That is that is absolutely true. I know issues whatsoever with that. Having said that, we did have two incidents of reported activities that were violations or alleged violations of the law, one against a male and one against a female in the period of time that we studied.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Do we have any data that says that people are more likely to be assaulted if they're working in a hotel with 100 rooms versus working at a hotel with less than 100 rooms?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know of any information like that. At least I haven't been exposed to that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Another. I mean, one of the things that concerns me, too, is if generally people who stay at hotels are more likely to commit sexual assaults, I would think that would be true for motels or even hotels under 100 rooms.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I could be wrong. And again, I'm open to hearing if that's that data. But my curiosity is why aren't we trying to protect workers at hotels for under 100 rooms?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I guess that's not that's not really a question. Well, it's not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Really I guess that's not really a question for the chief. But maybe I more I think we should adopt a policy tonight to put into place safety measures for all of our housekeepers. But I think we should do it for all hotels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I really do. Does it matter if you have ten rooms or if you have 300 rooms? If we want to protect housekeepers, we should protect them regardless of whether they work for a national chain or not. So the other question I would have for the city attorney and I don't know if you know this, but one of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the comments was that there was no litigation that resulted out of similar statutes passed in Emeryville and other cities. Do you know if that's true? Because that's not the research I did and I could be wrong. But I'm just curious if you know anything about that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm not the expert on it. But we did look at Emeryville, and I don't believe that they had the panic button issue. They passed an ordinance that had a square footage. Oh, cleaning requirement. Seattle had an initiative that had the both the notice requirements and a cleaning limitation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mm hmm. Okay. And so with. With either of them, was there any litigation, if you know?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, I do know. And yes, there was litigation in both situations. In Seattle, there was a challenge under preemption issues as to the square footage and cleaning Seattle. And that was under the I believe it's called the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there the court found that there was not preemption, that the city of Seattle, the language in that statute was did not preempt the city of Seattle from issuing that regulation and limiting the square footage. And then there was also challenges on constitutional basis as to the list.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in that case, the court found that the challenge was a facial challenge. And the the court found that there was no facial challenge, that it was constitutional. But they left open the question of as and as applied challenge, that there was no list and there were no people on the list as of the time of the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'oral argument.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I understand. And do you have any idea how much those those suits cost the cities or how how significant they were, if at all? I mean, lawsuits are common, so that's certainly not a deterrent from us engaging in good policy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I'm just asking the question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's certainly not. But the my information from the city of Emeryville is they spent approximately 750 $800,000 in defending their suit. I do not have that similar information for the city of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to stay on the topic of the safety concerns, because then I have a few questions on the workload concerns. On the safety concerns in on page two of the item. It talks about providing notice to hotel employees, requiring hotel employees to provide notice to the employees prior to starting their scheduled work of any guests on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the list of alleged harassers or a sex offender.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I have a couple of questions about this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And really, it comes down to privacy. So if someone is a convicted sexual offender and required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Penal Code Section 290, the law gives them the right to stay at a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The largest allows them to stay at a hotel. What I'm concerned about is alleging violations of sexual misconduct and that person ending up on some sort of a list. And the reason I worry about that, I'm sorry that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not an item.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It says of any guest on the list of alleged harassers. So, okay, so maybe I guess my question would be it says here that there's going to be a list of alleged harassers. So if that is actually in the item on page two, I could be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm just reading the item. If that actually is on the item, then my question would be, who is making the allegation? Where is the list going to be maintained? Does the allegation have to be corroborated like it would in, you know, a criminal justice setting and what privacy information of that guest would be made available pursuant to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that list? So I could be wrong. Maybe it's not on there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Regarding workloads.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's a lot of the comments we heard tonight and in my meetings with Unite Here. One of the things that they said was that it's important to regulate. Square footage of hotel rooms, because hotel rooms of today have a very different realities than hotel rooms in the past.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Heavier mattresses are used. The pillows need to be treated with different care because of the quality of the pillows. More glass is used in the room requiring more wiping down. And so that makes sense to me that the work load time you're spending in the room might be longer.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But in looking at the item on page three, what it says is that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The square.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Footage limitation, it says this limitation should apply to any combination of spaces, including guests, rooms and suites. Meeting rooms are hospitality rooms and apply regardless of the furniture, equipment or amenities in any room. So I guess my question would be, does this mean that if a person is cleaning a banquet room, does that go into the 4000'",
        "'speaker_11': 'square feet calculation? And the reason I ask that is because I'm certainly not an expert in this industry, which is probably why I have concerns about us regulating workloads in this industry. But the arguments that were made to me by Unite here had to do specifically with hotel rooms, and that's not how the item is written.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'd like some clarity on whether that applies to all rooms and all spaces. And I know these are kind of nuanced details that that aren't very exciting to talk about, but nevertheless, there are questions that I have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In regards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To. I did have a question regarding the protections about workload that we provide to our own city employees. Other than what.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We go through with OSHA.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do we have any limitations on the workloads of our own employees that our city and that's for the city manager, that our city regulations not having to do with OSHA, like do we limit the number of police reports a police officer can write or do we you know, do we have anything like that that has nothing to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'do with OSHA?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Most of our regulations come to us through our muse, and our meeting confers whether it's whichever of our 11 organizations that we work with. Certainly, as you mentioned, we do have OSHA regulations in our fleet and public works departments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's D.O.T. regulations for our refuse department on how many hours a driver can work or how many how many hours per day. We certainly have other regulations for use and our fire department, we have four man crews instead of three man crews, and we limit how many hours in a row a fire department fireman, a firefighter can'",
        "'speaker_9': 'work. Same thing with a PD officer. But most of the limitations that we have would be through our memorandum of understanding when we go through our labor contracts with our organizations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And and do you know, Mr. West again and I know this is kind of an unfair question to ask you, because this isn't a staff item. But do you know if.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Overtime requirements and things that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Are regulated through.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The state that we have to follow for our own employees?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, FLSA we have to require we have to provide.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Overtime when people work certain hours and things and that's regulated by the state. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And again, since this isn't a staff initiated item, I'm not sure who to ask the question of, but I don't how many hotels have mandatory overtime because I've not heard of too many that have mandatory overtime. So I'd like to know the answer to that question if anyone has it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And of course, anti retaliation, I'm 1,000% supportive of that. People should not be getting retaliated for advocating for their own rights or for engaging in a collective bargaining association, which I've been a member of for 18 years. I'm fully supportive of that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they shouldn't be retaliated for for involved getting involved in that activity. In regards to the workload regulations, I will say one thing. I mean, I know this was presented and has been presented a lot as a woman's bill, but I will I will tell you guys one thing, and I can already anticipate what the reaction is'",
        "'speaker_11': 'going to be. But I'm going to speak genuinely and I'm going to speak from the heart. I am a woman and I am a working woman. And it is very, very important to me that I be given equal pay for equal work that I do in my work environment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what that means to me is I don't need any accommodation in terms of the number of hours I work or the type of assignments that my employer gives me in my job, which is a male dominated job, I can do every single thing my male counterparts can do, and I expect to be paid exactly the same'",
        "'speaker_11': 'as my male counterparts because I will work exactly the same hours.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That they require.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so perhaps I'm missing. Something here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We're going to regulate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Workloads, we should be regulating workloads for men and women, not just for women. We are equal in every way. Whatever a man can do, whether it's in the battlefield, in a in a mechanic shop, in an operating room, a woman can do two and she can do it at the same level.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I would argue in some cases better. So, so for me, I, I, I, I think there are aspects of this proposed ordinance that are fantastic. And I would be and I want to hear comments from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, no disrespect in expressing my genuine opinions on this. I am engaging in this debate in the spirit of civility and respect, respecting my colleagues and understanding that we may not agree on everything. I will tell you, if there was a will, I'd be ready to vote on the safety issues right now and make that an'",
        "'speaker_11': 'ordinance. I have concerns about the workload conditions. I shared a story with a couple of the folks from Unite here who came to see me today. And again, I'm sure there's going to be internal and external eye rolling as I share the story, but I think it's an important story to share.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I flew back from Montreal on Sunday night with my husband. We were seated at the back of the plane. There were 33 rows. We were in row 32, and so we got to spend a lot of time with the flight attendants.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm kind of chatty and I talk to anybody who will talk to me. My husband won't. So I was talking to the flight attendant and I she doesn't know I'm a council member. She certainly doesn't know about Claudia's law.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I asked her, I said, Well, how do you like these international trips? And she said, We actually really don't like international trips because when we fly international, the flight's a little bit longer and people eat more on the plane, so they put more things in the seat back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's always crumbs and things on the floor. And so when we deplane the effort and the work that's required by the flight attendants to get the ready, the plane ready in a short period of time for the next group of passengers is very cumbersome.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a really hard process. It's it's hard cleaning. They don't like it. They prefer the one hour flights because people don't eat full meals in the one hour flight. And so I was thinking to myself, obviously, this woman doesn't know what I do, but I was thinking to myself what would happen next if the airline industry union'",
        "'speaker_11': 'came to us and said, we want you to regulate the number of international airplanes that our flight attendants have to clean per day, or if any other industry came to us and said, we want you to regulate, and maybe they're not an industry that's represented by a union.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Maybe it's just a group of employees at a at a carwash or at a nursery or whatever the case may be who say, you know what, we feel overworked. What are we going to say to them that, I'm sorry, your industry is not as thriving as the hotel industry, so we're not going to get involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Your interests, whoever is representing you is not as significant to us. So we're not going to worry about you right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's less than 100 of you. So sorry you're on your own. I just think that's not fair. So it's so in my opinion, if we're going to do this, then let's be prepared to really do this. We can't say yes to one class, one class of employees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, I was just thinking, what about the janitors and the chefs and the people who work the front desk? Like what aren't they going to be sitting there saying, Well, what about my workload?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, when we have a.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Big convention and nobody's I'm having to, you know, be standing on my feet the whole time at the front door dealing with entitled people who, you know, are upset that I'm not getting their bags.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, what.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'About those people? So so for me, I don't know why we're picking this one classification and not everybody. These are just concerns I have. I remain completely open minded. These are genuine questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That I have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we all work hard. You're right. So I think it's really important that we allow one another. This is a democracy. And one of the beautiful things about our country is that as long as we're engaging in civilized and respectful debate, we are in a in a room that respects democracy and differences of opinions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And just because we don't all agree on everything all of the time doesn't mean what someone has to say is funny or rude and not worthy of consideration. Everything everyone said in this room tonight is worthy of consideration, including what I had to say.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I thank you for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We're going to we have definitely a lot of folks lined up. I'm going to go through them here in a minute. But just want as a reminder, obviously, make sure that everyone on the council, regardless of their opinions respected and that we're obviously listening to what folks just saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I want to, first of all, just just to say thank you to everybody who came out and spoke this evening. Appreciated all of the letters, all of the social media attention and all of the comments here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I want to first explain something as well when we bring forth an agenda item. There can be no more than four people on an agenda item. Right. And also, our brownout prevents us from being able to converse. And so that is somewhat limiting for for for the city council in terms of our ability to to really coordinate'",
        "'speaker_14': 'and talk about our concerns and to to to to reach public policy, sound public policy. And so we this is our forum. And our forum is as public. And and, you know, usually the lobby city council is is well attended.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so I'm glad to see so many people here this evening. The the issue of domestic workers, I'll just give you a little history. My grandmother was a domestic worker. My mother was a certified nursing assistant. She cleaned beds and made beds.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'My grandmother scrubbed floors on her hands and knees in a hospital for many years and retired with very bad knees. I have spent a career in all of my my my adult life here in City of Long Beach, working for better working conditions for not only hotel workers, but all workers.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Right. I was on an organizing committee over 20 years ago when there was this vision to make more hotels, union and unionize more hotels in Long Beach. We saw a need. I supported measure in I've walked picket lines with hotel workers over the years and those struggles will continue, I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I want to just let you know that I've been there over the last five years. We three large hotels in the city of Long Beach have were unionized and entered into collective bargaining agreements. We all we have agreements in place for new hotels that are in development for those to be union hotels as well.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That's progress. Am I right? And it's also those hotels and the workers and unite here for for reaching into entering into those agreements. And I believe those moves have significantly impacted the growth of convention and banquet activity in our city.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'When this this policy idea was first brought to my attention almost four years ago now, Suji Lowenthal was on the city council, and I thought she was going to bring it forward. For some reason, it just never came forward.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Janine Peirce was an organizer with with the hotel workers at the time. And I think she was the first person to bring this to my attention. I did express reservations then and concerns, as did many council members, I think, over the years about moving forward with such a policy.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I have kept an open mind and I did keep an open mind and hope that I would get sufficient data and evidence to be gathered and shared with the Council in support of a need for such a policy.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'What I heard here tonight was a lot of people talk about sexual assault. And, you know, that's that's not acceptable for any workplace, for any worker to experience that at any time. Right. And and and I'm not going to argue whether or not it happened or not, because I don't know the hotel guest.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And they're not here to tell me whether or not it happened or not, but I'm not going to second guess someone's experience. Mike, my question is whether or not this policy as proposed will do much to change. And I'm not sure the policy as proposed will do much to change.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The, the, the, the, the work, the nature of the work of a hospitality worker and the risk and that that's that's the difficult part I'm having here. No matter how big the size of the rooms or what we regulate or if we regulate anything or whether or not there are even panic buttons, I think panic buttons or'",
        "'speaker_14': 'and or other technologies should be employed and looked at and we should in. Courage that strongly. From the hospitality, the hotels and for our workers, I represent and work with people who work in our state correctional institutions. Right.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'In some of our most volatile state hospitals, they have panic buttons, they have security systems, and they also have correctional officers close by. But guess what? They get their victims of violent attacks all the time. And as a union rep.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And that's my profession. I and I've committed my, my, my, my, my, my life to this to this work. I am always in contact with Cal OSHA. When something like that happens, I make sure to put it on record because it's so, so important for future reference.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'When I go back and to see what happened and not, not have have a record of it happening. Makes it very, very difficult to talk, to inspire or to make change or to change a policy even in the workplace.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I've got to say that I'm a little bit disappointed. I'm a lot disappointed in the tone of this issue because I want to dig in and fix it and fix the issue. To use a vice mayor's term. I want to do a deeper dove.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Right. I think this this this policy, as has presented, is very, very complex. And there were a lot of pieces here that we can we can really, really work on. I'm not sure that it is something that we can do in one fell swoop tonight, though.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I think there are a lot of unanswered questions here. And I like to get get information from both, you know, the hotels and and and the advocates for the workers who have done a, I think, very good job of bringing data.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I asked for a lot of this data like two years ago, and I got it today. You know, unfortunately, I didn't get it. If I'd had it last week, it would have helped me shape. My, my, my, my thoughts a little bit differently on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so, like I said, I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't able to get that. And I'll be the debrief. And while I appreciate the Iraqi's advocacy on this issue, I really didn't appreciate some of the like I said, the tone, the subtle threats, the direct threats.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I found that to be very disparate, despicable, but also duly noted. And clearly from many of the comments that we received here this evening, I think some of the folks in the public are confused about the real intent and the complexity of this proposed policy.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'm sensitive I'm very sensitive to the issues of workplace safety and for hotel workers and all the workers in our city. And I hope we can walk away tonight with a commitment to support a safer, more dignified work environment and hopefully get something done.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'm enthusiastically in support of the right for union workers or workers to organize a democratic workplace and to choose a union to be their exclusive representative. Unionized workplaces result in better wages, benefits, and safer, fairer working conditions for all workers.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Collective bargaining agreements work. And if you don't have one, you know, when I look around here tonight, if every one of these advocates and strong supporters of this policy were to go and talk to a union employee or nonunion employee and get them to sign a card, I think would be 100% unionized in Long Beach in no'",
        "'speaker_14': 'time, because it doesn't seem like we're impacting thousands and thousands of workers. We're talking about a few hundred workers. Recent Gallup polls released showed that over 60% of Americans understand the need for unions to support unions. And so to the hotel industry, it's not a matter of if, but when these hotels go union.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so I think when you and I when you sat down with me a few weeks ago, I said, I think you should get ahead of this as much as you possibly can and be prepared to work with with the the employees groups.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That said, the item before us doesn't feel like super public policy, in my opinion, and it's not supported by my facts or the record of report it or there's no record of reported incidents. I'm still troubled with that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I think, you know, we can do better. And I think tonight it would would would serve us well to do a reset hit a reset button. To to to to commit as a council to continue to work on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I mean, this is there's not. I'm trying to figure out what what is the rush? This is we'll go back to the airport issue. What was what was the rush to get a policy? Why does this why can't we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Take our time.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And deal with this issue by issue? Because truly, I mean, the clock there is a favor by giving us an abbreviated reading of this. This is this needs to be very, very, very complicated. And and it does a lot as it seeks to do a lot.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I like to take our time and and break this down issue by issue and work on this to get a sound policy. And I want to have a question for the city attorney in terms of the enforceability of this.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If we were to look at every element of this this this proposed policy, what role will the city of Long Beach have in terms of enforcing it as drafted?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The motion seeks to have the enforcement be a self enforcement by the worker or a representative of the worker under the. The last bullet under enforcement. All of the provisions would be via a private right of action in superior court.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So there would be no responsibility for the City of Long Beach to enforce this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As I currently read the motion. That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I want to hear from some other council members on this. I in my opinion, this this this would be more of a vague. I think we'd be better served as a city council by offering a very strong resolution.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I heard some things here tonight that I heard from the very first time that I'm interested in in pursuing. I know our hospitality industry will grow and is projected to grow over the next several years significantly. We will be hosting the Olympics and in several years we will be ramping up for that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And we will have new hotels on on on board. I'm interested in in diversifying this workforce, I think and I'll just be very honest with you, the the mental image that we have of of a hospitality worker is, is, is and so much has been made and made about Marion, the the the issues of immigrants and workers'",
        "'speaker_14': '. And I get that that's important. But African-Americans should be represented in the workforce. Cambodians, the diversity of the city should be represented in that workforce. I'm not sure that the way this issue has been put before us that that is that is really reflected here.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I'm I'd like to know more about what that workforce looks like. So I'm going to just just take a take a shot at a substitute motion to request the city attorney to draft a resolution by the states, the city council, strong support for safe work, environment for all employees and Long Beach's hospitality industry that protects women'",
        "'speaker_14': '. And encourage encourages the best technology with in terms of panic buttons and surveillance. You know, in the hospitality industry, in all hotels. Second, I'd like to encourage the hospitality industry to work with the London's police department to develop and review their safety plans and predict that and protect our guests and employees to come up with the best'",
        "'speaker_14': 'safety plan possible. Three I like the city of Long Beach to support the rights of employees to organize and democratically select a union of their choice and support collective bargaining process in the hospitality industry. Four I'd like to encourage the employees or I'm sorry to encourage the hotels and motels in Long Beach to place a priority on'",
        "'speaker_14': 'hiring local residents and diverse residents and the diversity of the city to fill jobs. In fact, I'd like to resolve that we support these protections for all workers and guests at Long Beach hotels and motels, regardless of their size.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And that is my substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a substitute motion. Is there a second for that second councilmember, I think got some more stupider. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. We have that. We have to conduct a meeting. Please. Please. There's a second by Councilmember Supernanny, and I brought.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Them to Friendly's from colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a there's a motion. And the second customer I should probably want to speak to the second. I don't have to at this point. I want to make a couple of points. We can wait to hear from our colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up is Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to take the time to thank everyone who came tonight and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Brought their voice to this council. I think that discussing working conditions is always an important matter. Many of you know that I worked in a factory in Santa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ana as one of my jobs out of college, and I have stood behind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Workers, stood beside workers and been a worker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When workloads get difficult.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Times change and seasonal employment changes and the components of a workload are stressful and challenging. I echo the comments of Councilwoman Pryce that in any of those conditions, though, I want to be treated as an equal, and I want men and women to be treated the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to earn the same wages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also want to thank the members of Unite here who.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Met with me about two weeks ago or three weeks ago. And we discussed point by point throughout the policy that they had proposed and some of the concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That I had about the policy at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was disappointing that in those dialogs and conversations there was no openness to modifications. I have some personal experiences. Almost two years ago, a member of my family who does work in downtown Long Beach, who does not work in the hotel industry, who does have a panic button in her workspace, pressed the panic button more than 12'",
        "'speaker_2': 'times and nobody came for more than 40 minutes. She was held hostage and nobody came in her building. Our L.A. County Sheriff's. And nobody came. And so I have consistently stated that relying on technology is never enough. I am open to supporting ideas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Related to real change and real protections. Pairs of people working.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Together, not just women, but women and men. And to other ideas that could be seen throughout this policy. And we sat through an hour and a half of public comment on this. And often the individuals speaking at the dais talked to how they had come to meeting after meeting and provided their feedback.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we accepted that feedback and made modifications. 100 meetings, 50 community meetings that came about with a policy that I know all of us feel very confident in and strongly behind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I want to get to a place like that for each and every.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of you, because abuse in the workplace shall never be tolerated in Long Beach. So. I look forward to a continued dialog and I appreciate any opportunity to move in a direction of strong policy. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, colleagues, for your comments and your questions. So I'm going to address some of the questions. Councilmember Price, you had asked the question, why together these items together are an item about inhumane working conditions, whether it's sexual assault or whether it's having to work overtime or missing your 15 minute breaks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You've heard I was in your office several years ago when we heard from women talking about increased duties because they were skipping the bathroom, because they weren't allowed to use the bathroom on the floor that they were cleaning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's been a lot of tension and there's a lot of fear in some women to come forward still. But this item is not an item that is here today and hasn't been here for three years. We've had the only request that we've really had has been, can you give us more data?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you give us more data about the sexual assaults? Well, the data we have on sexual assaults is 91% of our victims are women. That's why this is a women's issue. 80 plus percent of the women in our hotel and the people in our hotel industry are women.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's why it's a women's issue. And I think we had men come out and speak to that as well. And there are men in that industry as well. But we cannot ignore that. While we've been fighting for equal pay, while we've been fighting for equal treatment of women, it still doesn't happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even when we have people that are fighting for that, it still doesn't happen. And so we have to, at a local level, be able to create as much opportunity to talk about structural oppression. It's not necessarily that the manager at that hotel is the one that says, we're going to do this to our women.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's because that's the way structures are created. It's because some of these women are immigrants. And whether they're documented or not documented, they come over here and they're fighting to get the best job they can or a job that they have family already in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's why these industries are that way. And so I just you know, why women that's that's why women live together, because it's about inhumane working conditions. And it's not about OSHA. It's about I tell you, my first year in council, I mean, I was tired, I was exhausted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I went through some some trauma in my first year in council, some a lot of other things. And not sleeping well at night and going through the things that I'm going through at home meant that it made it worse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what we're talking about when women are overworked and they have sexual assault on top of it and they have that on top of it, and then they have to go home and feed their families. They have to go home and try to do their homework with their kids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The days that I'm exhausted or the days that my kid is the most hyper or the days that she wants my attention the most. And so that's why this is packaged together and that's why workers have asked us to keep it that way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I agree. Councilmember Price Let's go to zero. Let's do all hotels in the city. Let's say we need to have sexual assault protections for all hotels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I do want to again embark on the conversation that we have been here for three years. Yes, Sergio was in the seat and this conversation was here and we've sat down. And when I first got to office, I really did make an effort.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And whether you guys, some people out there want to short discount that effort. I sat down with every manager I had to beg for a meeting with the with the last manager of the Westin and another hotel still refused to meet with me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I came to them with the message and I met with with you, Jeremy. I met with a lot of folks. And I came and I said, You know what, guys? I've worked with you right here for ten years, not on their payroll as a as a partner for ten years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I understand this policy more than anybody. If anybody can sit down and say, where's a middle ground here? Where are the areas that we I can learn about your industry in a better way that might help me craft the very best policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what happened instead of that? Whenever me and the vice mayor and several other on this council said, you know what, let's create a long process. It could be a year where we do roundtables and we talk about the research and we do all of this instead of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We got some complaints about my role at a nonprofit that doesn't make any money off of this policy one. And so basically we said we're going to wait a year. In that year, you guys could have been doing some research and bringing back to us some actual reasons to not pass this policy instead of don't Governor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You could have done that work and been able to come back and say, here's what's reasonable. Here's what works for us. We never heard what works for you. Besides, don't do it. And that's my frustration, because I saw people in this audience and I'll put you on the spot here a little bit because we partner every policy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've done the up, the entertainment stuff, everything I've done, I've put forward a full process. A roundtable sometimes includes people throughout the city to say, I'm not going to dictate. We're going to do this together. On this one, I didn't have a partner on the other side that was willing to sit down and do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's my frustration today, was saying this is not a well-made policy. This is a policy that was done by people that are experts in this field. Right. These guys are there in hotels every day throughout the world.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they've seen best practices. And we know that in New York, these practices are there. We know that in Seattle, things are happening. And so I just really want to discount that. I know the process has been difficult.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as you mentioned, the Brown Act, you know, ties us from being able to have the really get in the nitty gritty with it. But the time is now. These women have been waiting, the time is now. And so what I want to do is I would like to make a substitute substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's right. Ladies and gentlemen, my first substitute substitute motion to pass the original motion, but to phase it in the 4000 square foot requirements over two years. In the following way, year one would be hotels over 300 rooms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Year two would be hotels 299 rooms down to 100. And I would like to see, you know, 0 to 99 in that group as well. I think that the city attorney has met several times with probably both sides.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they're this is a well-crafted policy. We've had the city attorney say that policies like this have been had litigation and they've fallen short. So I feel like we could do the right thing with our city, protecting our city and protecting our workers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really hope that I can count on you all to support something that people have worked really hard on. There's been a lot of research. We know that this square footage and one last time when you look at the square footage, that's something that took a long time to get to a number to understand what people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are doing right now. And that's not a number that's too high. So when we know people are already cleaning that, it's about the extreme days. It's about the extreme days when we have conferences in town and conventions in town and a worker is asked to work ten or 12 hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's what this is about. So it's saying that we need to be able to protect that, and that's why that number is there. It's not arbitrary. Again, my substitute substitute motion is on the floor. I hope I can count on my colleagues support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They can just. Thank you. Let me let me just clarify also, just so where you just clarify, there's a there's a substitute substitute motion, which is the final motion. There's a second, but is there a second for the motion?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez. Okay. And the district attorney I think I think the reps have a different seconder because it's the same as the as the first motion or doesn't matter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Fine. It could be seconded by the councilmember from the first District. I just need clarification on the phase in period, if you could. Yes, repeat that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It says that the phase in with the 4000 square foot requirement would go over two years in the following way, year one would be hotels over 300 rooms. In year two would be hotels 219. Well, yeah, 299 rooms down to zero.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that motion then eliminates the 100 rooms or more for the purposes of all of the issues the panic button, the meeting and everything, or just for the square footage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the sexual assault piece.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that that's different than the square footage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want it for everything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For everything? Yes. Thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we have a subset. There's a lot of speakers, so we're going to go through each speaker and continue the conversation. Councilmember Supernova. Thank you. And I'd like to thank everyone who's here tonight. Many of you have been here for 7 hours, so we really appreciate your diligence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to thank Councilmember Austin for his substitute motion, which I think he said, let's hit the reset button. I like that language, but I really think what we need to do is fine tune this going forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't think the substitute substitute motion really addresses that. A couple of things that I want to follow up on that Councilmember Price had mentioned. First of all, was the Emeryville case and the cost of that. And Mr. City attorney Emeryville is a much smaller community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if if the cost of litigation there was $800,000, I think we could anticipate it would be a greater sum here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember I think that's difficult to to make the analogy that based on the size of the city, the cost of the litigation would vary greatly, but the litigation would be expensive regardless. Yes, sir. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you look at the responsibility we have as council members, one of them is to protect the taxpayer. And it's one thing to say that this might trigger litigation, but we don't have consensus here right now that the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'System would work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we might be litigating an item that that didn't wasn't successful in terms of of initiating change. The other issue that Councilwoman Price brought up was mandatory overtime. That piece I don't know if we've discussed it enough, but I think the issue I have here and again with our responsibilities, that is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is something that we don't have for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our own employees in the city. So I have a hard time philosophically with that, that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How can we not how can we have mandatory overtime for our city employees?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But now we're going to tell the private sector, you cannot have mandatory overtime. It's a classic do as I say, not as they do. And that's a real tough hurdle for me to get over. So back to the original point, I'll support the substitute motion by Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Next up, we have Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I. I want to thank Councilwoman Councilmember Pearce for bringing this forward. I know all of us. It's been a very long night, but I really do believe in this substitute substitute motion. I believe that we need to stick with the original plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is something that we cannot waiver on a resolution over. An ordinance basically tells. I think many of us that this is not something that should be taken seriously. To bifurcate the item to talk about again, the data, the non reports I think is just really a slap in the face to many of the victims that have'",
        "'speaker_10': 'have dealt with this. So. It is. And I will say council member, super or not taxpayers, sexual victims are taxpayers, too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think it's they are.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And quite frankly, to sit there and say that we owe it to taxpayers only. Well, we are all of us are taxpayers as well. And I think it's really important that we look at, you know, the overall investments that we're making here in the city and what we're doing with our taxpayer dollars to invest into the hospitality'",
        "'speaker_10': 'industry. We need to get that money back to be able to and reinvest in our hotel workforce. So I hope that we we do that. And as far as facts, you know, we absolutely need additional facts as much as possible to make a more formulated decision.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I think your facts are the people that are sitting right here talking to you and telling you how it is that they are dealing with this every single day. So I will say this, that I believe we should stick with the substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm certainly I think we're both open to friendly amendments because we want to make sure that this is right and we get it right. But they need to be reasonable and they need to make sure that they address a lot of the issues we've addressed here today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So with that said, I hope we can stick with the substitute motion, substitute substitute motion. And again, I hope we also are able to offer some ideas that would be that would work for all of us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Next up, I have Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor and I. So I also would like to thank everyone who stuck around here tonight to listen to this very important, you know, item here on the diocese. But what I'm really seriously I do understand the efforts of all the workers in the hospitality industry and this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I sympathize with the struggles that they face. You know, I think in both the hotels and the workers, the wonderful access to our city. Without another, we would not be able to be called or be known as the tourist city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, in my opinion, a resolution is a way, I think, to express hotels that we can be a city recognized, need to address issues in the workplace, but we also want to provide them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To an opportunity to resolve these matters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In a collaborative way in which we're going through, you know, not result. Your work is to understand each other and work together to identify problems that are needed in a feasible option and benefit each other equally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as a city, I do think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can do what we're working for them. But what we can do is support we can support their conversations and their resolutions. So my my support would definitely be like we do the pause button because the fact that this is a very, very, very complicated situation, I think we need to really understand all of this before we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'start making these decisions, because this is going to be a very important decision for all of us out here tonight. And if anyone out there do not believe that we do not believe in safety or a safe place for workers, not only for FEMA's, but for me, and also because we are struggling in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next up is Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you. And appreciate the support for the the reset, the pause. And I want to encourage strongly encourage all the hotel workers as well as the hospitality industry to work together. And I think Councilmember Gonzalez and peers, we can all work together to continue to have these conversations and work on these issues because we are a world'",
        "'speaker_14': 'class city and we are a tourist destination. I want to know why are our city hotels and how our city hotels are different from Santa monica and how they're different from Los Angeles and in Anaheim? You all know that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I don't know it. I want to I want to learn more about this this industry that is that is very important for the future of the city. I came to this city as a as an aerospace worker or as an aircraft worker from over 25 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And that industry is gone. Right. The hospitality industry is more and more important today than ever before. And so I don't want to be rushed into any sort of decision on emotion. Right. I want to make sure that we're making measured decisions, that we're making decisions that are going to be in the best interest of of of'",
        "'speaker_14': 'all residents. And I want our residents and hospitality workers to to to enjoy the benefits and the the profits that that that will come. From this industry in the future. And so I think we need to be very careful and measured in how we do that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so I'm going to stand on my motion, my substitute motion to start a resolution, but also ask that that labor, that community, that the city council continue to work together. And we can come back next week with other propositions to to to continue to study this.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I think this is going to be a longer term study then. Then. Then I felt a fell swoop. And let me just say something about the council and everybody behind this dais. Everybody has a story. Everybody comes from a struggle from one way or another.'",

There are three of us in the state from the national organization Anti-gay. California supported SB 54 in its most visionary form as a priority bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in fact, 75 around the state supported through a lobby day and made 40 visits to legislators that day. It's not a perfect bill, but it's a crucial step forward. And what we need here without any delay is a local sanctuary policy which will address the gaps, the gaps in SB 54 and end and ensure that Long'",

Every human being matters and does not deserve to be filled with walls of UN security when taking their children to school or conducting daily chores.

But, you know, there has been support from city leadership for campaigns and developments that would directly affect those people that we need to be protecting the most, such as the 2028 Olympics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, like enticing Amazon to come set up their headquarters in our city when inviting with them the issues that directly affect immigrant communities like, you know, gentrification, contractual jobs and displacement, a militarized police presence, it drives out diversity, as we can see in the city of Seattle, which already has the Amazon headquarters.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'button? It's that simple. It's everything that we're doing already is just how we're doing it from this point on could be different. So what I'm proposing is a bill to allow that to happen. Is that okay with you guys?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can continue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right. Well, first of all, you know, there's all this money getting thrown away into the garbage, literally by spending the money on getting rid of the trash. So how about we create a new industry on making the trash into the homes and making it safe and healthy for people because people are already doing it in parts'",

So how about we make jobs that way and we turn deserts into rainforests and make houses for people who can't pay for them for themselves? Right.

        "'speaker_7': 'that off every month. And if in two months you could finish the development, in six months, you could grow your food and look for zero. How does that not get money in everybody's pocket? And how is that not make everybody satisfied with how they're living?'",

        "'speaker_2': 'get more money off of them. And what we're asking is actually quite the minimum. I feel like the California Values Act is getting watered down. So I'm really asking for a Long Beach to consider a much stronger just trust act.'",
