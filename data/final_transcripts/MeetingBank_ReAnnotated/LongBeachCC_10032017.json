        "'speaker_0': 'So, Madam Clerk, we're the first hearing, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication from City Attorney Recommendation to receive supporting documentation under the record. Conclude the public hearing and declare ordinance. Amending the Long Beach Municipal Code to establish the Urban Agriculture Incentive Zone Program. Read for the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adopt a resolution approving the form of the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'UHC.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Contract and authorize the City Manager or director of Development Services to execute such contracts and adopt a resolution directing the Director of Development Services to submit a request to the California Coastal Commission to certify an amendment to the Certified Local Coastal Program Citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. City Attorney. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. We have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A short presentation by Oscar Orsi, our deputy director of development services, and Larry Rich, our sustainability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Coordinator. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Mayor. Members of council, Mr. Larry Rich, our sustainability coordinator, is here to give you a brief presentation on this matter. Thank you, Mr. Orsi. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the City Council. The item here before you tonight is the Long Beach Urban Agriculture Incentive Zones.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have an ordinance that will implement this. So first, some quick background. Urban ag incentive zones were created by the city of California in 2014. In 2016, the County of Los Angeles adopted an ordinance that would enable incorporated cities to establish their own local programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In May 2016, the City Council requested that staff explore the feasibility of implementing the UAS program in Long Beach. And then just a couple of months ago in June, city council requested the city attorney draft an ordinance to establish the Urban AG Incentive Zone Program and to define land use zones eligible to participate in the UHC program'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So what is UAC? What it means basically is that eligible owners of vacant lots can enter into a contract with the city to use their land for agricultural purposes for a period of five years at a minimum. If they do this, the owner's property taxes would be reduced based on an assessment of the property value as agricultural'",
        "'speaker_0': 'land. And once that happens, we would like to see that vacant lots are cultivated, which would reduce blight and increase access to locally grown organic produce. The nature of the zoning component of the ordinance that you're considering tonight would be to adopt the state definition of urban agriculture with additional language clarifying that this does not include cultivation'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of marijuana. It would additional changes to zoning would allow urban agriculture as a matter of right within multifamily, commercial and industrial zones. And it would require an administrative use permit within single family to family and heavy industrial zones.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other part of the ordinance would establish a Long Beach UHC program, including the approval of a form UAE, the contract that property owners would enter into with the city of Long Beach. It would authorize the city manager or his designee or the director of development services to execute UAE contracts with eligible vacant lot owners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the basic process that this goes through involves the County of Los Angeles to see it all the way through. But first part of the process, the owners would apply to the program through development services. Applications would be reviewed and then referred to the County Assessor's office and the Treasurer tax collector.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Approved contracts would be recorded with the L.A. County Registrar recorder and then recorded contracts would be filed back with the city of Long Beach and the assessor's office and property owners would be able to realize their tax benefit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So why are we doing this? Benefits of the program. We would help build more robust local food systems and access to locally grown produce. These would potentially create gathering places for community and opportunities for gardening education. We want to reduce blight and create opportunity for neighborhood scale, economic development and green jobs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are co-benefits and means of compliance with the proposed vacant lot registry, which you'll also be hearing in the next hearing. And then finally, the access to incentives through the county of Los Angeles, meaning the county of Los Angeles set aside funding that would offset the property tax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So none of that property tax benefit would hit the city of Long Beach. And the city can implement this and access that those incentives at a minimal administrative cost to the city. So that concludes my presentation, and I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We're going to go in. Is there any public comment on this? I know we've discussed this issue before. Please come forward. Okay. Is there anybody else? Okay, I'll just be these two speakers. That's all close speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's go ahead. Okay. Hi. My name is Charles Moore, and I'm the founder of Long Beach Organic. And Larry's history went back a couple of years, but the actual vacant lot task force organized by Councilman Ray Bensky and Councilman Alan Lowenthal was active around 1993, and there were a number of problems with vacant lots at that time'",
        "'speaker_0': 'due to the closure of the automobile sales along Long Beach Boulevard. And there have been quite a few vacant lots left there and there was other areas and other problems with vacant lots and a lot of ideas were put forward as to what to do with them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the only one that really came to fruition was creating urban organic gardens, and that's when I founded Long Beach Organic in 1994. Our first one was on First and Elm downtown. We then got what we called that first, the Wild Oats Garden when they came to town along the Pacific Electric, right of way between Loma and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Grand, that was. And a donation from Wild Oats to Long Beach Organic to establish that garden, which is still active and thriving. And I just want to come forward and support the concept of creating organic urban agriculture, especially important to a city that is next to the ocean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the jobs that we did after the riots at Long Beach Organic, when along Atlantic Avenue, several businesses burnt down, was to instead of spraying herbicides to keep the weeds down on these vacant lots, we got local gardeners and tree trimmers to bring their mulch and we hired local folks to spread the mulch and keep the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'weeds down that way. And then they became urban organic gardens. And actually one of the gardens then was turned into a house for humanity there on Hill and Atlantic. So it creates what we call softening of the urban hardscape when you do these organic gardens, allows rainwater to percolate, allows bioremediation of toxics before they enter the marine'",
        "'speaker_0': 'environment. So I sort of felt there was this land and sea connection. I started the Marine Research Foundation to emphasize the importance. They were both founded on December of 1994, and it was to emphasize that the ocean land connection and to bring that concept of softening the urban hardscape.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's what this will do. It will soften the urban hardscape. So I encourage you to vote in favor of this proposal. Thank you. Next Speaker And actually, I had I had close the speaker's list. Ms.. Oh, I'm going to let you speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But just, you know, once I call the coastal speakers list and no one else is in line, we need to close it. So I'm going to say you're the last speaker. Okay. Go ahead. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Vice Mayor and members of council Tony D'Amico here with Long Beach Fresh, co-director of Local Food Policy Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Make it really brief, because I know we've talked about this initiative a lot. I just want to take the opportunity to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for his leadership on this and also definitely to thank city Staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Larry and his staff and development services for their amazing work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And really pulling this together, you it's been a long process, but we're very excited to help with implementing this program. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you for giving me the word. My name is Daniel Kovach. I'm a resident of First District and a member of the Long Beach Alliance for Food and Fitness of Star Central Long Beach.

        "'speaker_2': 'We can increase the land access for the production of housing, look locally grown fruit on rock and lots. Many of my neighbors and restaurants would be happy to able to grow those natural foods themselves, and many of them would be happy to be able to buy locally grown and affordable produce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also, this is an amazing learning opportunity which their children would be able to have during their field trips and quality family time. Being able to use this vacant lot for such a great cause and not only will make our city community health better, not only for the sustainability of our city, but it will also reduce the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'high deserts which are created by this work. And lots of they are full of trash and broken furniture and simply dangerous places, an eyesore. So I want to ask you again to stop the ordinance and empower all your city residents to take control over their health.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have close public comment. We're going to go and go back to the city council, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just wanted to just say a few things, so I want to acknowledge, Larry, the development service team, Allison, Amy, Oscar, everyone who's played a part in this. We started the conversation over well over a year ago about how this put this ordinance and a vacant lot registry could work together as a sort'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of carrot and stick. We know we have vacant lots and of remain vacant for 20 or some some eight years. They're a strain on our code enforcement, a blight on our corridors, our neighborhoods. And we also know, on the other hand, urban, that urban agriculture, it's exciting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It brings people together, it makes them volunteer, and it gives them some real it really inspires people to really get involved in their neighborhoods. And we've seen it from the library garden at the Michelle Obama library, the Victory Garden in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A lot of the community gardens, we see what happens when we bring gardening. So what happens when you take sort of penalties on vacant lots in place that partner that with opportunities and incentives and and we hope that we will become the first city in L.A. County to actually implement it in and have someone take advantage of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'these incentives. And so, so good work to all of you. Larry, just have one question. So what should this this ordinance and the next item both pass this hearing in the next hearing? What's implementation look like next year?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before the Urban League incentive zone. It should go into effect in mid-November after the second hearing and 31 days passed. However, there is a deadline of the end of the calendar year to get new requests in to make it into the tax year next year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's it's. Possible, but not likely that we will get takers that we can get through the county process by the end of December. So basically what it means is we have all of next year to sign up property owners to get their benefits secured for 2019.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the good news is the governor signed a bill just recently that extends this program for another ten years. So once once we're looking for properties next year, we'll have ten years to sign people up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you. So consider the call to action once this goes into effect in November. Let's try it. Let's you know, let's once it goes into effect after the next reading, let's see if we can get a property to take advantage of the first round so we can have an example to point to as we go through'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and do outreach next year. Thank you for your time and obviously as my support and I encourage city council support you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Got some repairs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you. And Larry and the whole team. Thank you guys for all the work that you guys did and think you vice mayor, for your leadership on this. I think this is a fantastic step in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Larry, I also had a clarifying question. It seemed like a big process for folks to go through. We think they can get through that process in two months. Is that correct? Well through a whole year. You mentioned that you wanted to have people through the county process by December, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. It's conceivable that if we had and we're willing to work with someone prior to the ordinance officially being implemented to get those discussions going. What we don't know is how long it will take to get through the county's process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you saw there is three different county agencies we need to check in with. So we're it's worth a shot, but people will have to come and talk to us right away.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Okay. Thank you so much. And again, congratulations, everybody. And thanks for the community for working hard on this item as well, too. Thanks.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor, and members of the City Council. I'm here to update you on the vacant lot registry ordinance. That's before you this evening. Just a quick background to remind you that, as you know, vacant lots, especially those that aren't well-kept or maintained, are associated with decreased perceptions of neighborhood safety as well as decreased neighbor nearby property values.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in 2016, this council requested the city manager to explore feasibility of doing a citywide vacant lot registry ordinance to address those impacts. That secured a list of 2100 potential vacant lots from the county researched vacant lot registries across the country.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as you heard back in June, our findings were that only 618 of those original and 2100 lots were actually eligible for the program. And that was assessed through GIS, through aerial photography, and through our own city records.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we did a random sample in the field and got a 98% accuracy rate based on this information. We came forward on June 13th to share those findings and got direction from the council who asked the city attorney to draft a vacant lot registry ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That ordinance is before you. This evening. It would establish a new chapter in the Municipal Code.

This is being brought forward with the item you just voted on now are urban ag incentive zones.'",

We know that our local food, our food, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, travel thousands of miles to get to to the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'fork. And so it's really important to help reduce our vehicle. Miles traveled by increasing access to local food, which also helps activate those vacant lots for positive community supporting uses. With that, I'm available to answer any questions you might have.'",

More fees for the people who own the vacant lot. And there would be property owners while they have to have more fees.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I think the title of the email I think I sent it to all of you was Dead on Arrival. Well, the first your first three offer failed by an average of 96% voted against it. You picked up a few extra votes in the in the skilled and basic general unit.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. And members of the Council. Senate Bill 415 amended the election code was signed by Governor Brown in 2015. The intent of Senate Bill 415 is to improve voter turnout at local elections. SB 415 requires the local public agency with a nine concurrent election to change its dates either the statewide primary or a general election'",
        "'speaker_7': '. If the agency's voter turnout for the municipal election held on a non concurrent date was at least 25% lower than the average voter turnout for the last four statewide general elections. SB 415 only impacts regularly scheduled local elections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Primary and general. It doesn't affect the timing of special elections. So those items may go on a ballot at any time as allowed by state law. For nearly two years, it was unclear whether this bill applied to Long Beach as a charter city and the provisions of the Charter of the City of Long Beach directly conflict with'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the provisions of SB 415. In 2016, a request was made to the California Attorney General to clarify that issue. And in July of this year, the Attorney General issued opinion, holding that SB 415 does in fact apply to charter cities and school districts governed by their city charter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So while the Attorney General opinion is not legally binding like a court decision, they're viewed by the courts as highly persuasive excuse me. And local agencies generally follow them as they would a court decision. So what is required?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'SB 415 requires a political subdivision may hold an election on other than statewide election dates. If, by January 1st of 2018, the city has adopted a plan to consolidate future elections with a statewide election no later than January of or no later than 2022.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The bill or the law doesn't really go into what the specifics of the plan are. But it is our recommendation that we recommend the Council to adopt or direct us to prepare a resolution for your consideration. Adopting a plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The There has been a change since this item was placed on the agenda. The governor did sign Senate Bill 568 568 further complicates this this already complicated item. What 568 does is it will move effective 2019 the state's primary election from June to March and allow the governor to move that even earlier in the year during presidential'",
        "'speaker_7': 'elections. So the impact of this would be beginning in 2020. The city would have to move their elections or the city has three options. They could adopt and move in 2018, 2020 or 2022. Our office is not recommending moving for the 2018 elections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a matter of just practically being able to do it in that time frame. We already are in the election cycle. The it would also, we believe, create additional confusion for the voters because in 18 they would vote in June, in November and then in 2020 you would vote in March and November.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we and also the city clerk can weigh in here, too, that the we may not be able to consolidate with the county in 18. We're hoping by 2020 the county would have their new election system in place so that we can consolidate and that would save money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also need to work with our partners at the school district to bring them into the process. We have reached out to them and we will work with them on a go forward basis on how that implements and impacts them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So tonight, if the motion as provided would direct us to prepare a resolution adopting a plan to implement SB 415 and to move the primary general elections pursuant to state law and the effective date we are asking or recommending it be 2020.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If that recommendation is adopted, what would be the next steps we would return with that resolution? Adopting the plan to change the election dates further, the resolution would direct the city attorney to draft amendments to the Long Beach Municipal Code to make the necessary changes to implement the plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That would include ordinance to change the election cycle when election funds become surplus. What date? So the elected official would take office if elected in November. It could be the third Tuesday in December. It would take we would have to look at how long is it for the certification of the election and what would be the desire'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So we would come back to council with those recommendations. We're not asking for those decisions to be made tonight. That would come back. We would have the resolution directing us to prepare those amendments. We would draft those amendments, come back and get input from the city council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'City council can direct that to committee. They can do what they like without. Then we would come back with a final version. So at this time, we believe that the city is required to move their election under the law.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It does invalidate, in essence, a portion of our charter on when the election dates are held. And I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There is a motion on a second to approve the city attorney's recommendation for 2020. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I actually would like to hear from our city clerk just her take on this item before making any comments and hearing from my colleagues, if that's okay. Just your. I know that there's a legal recommendation right at the state level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the 2020 timeline. Does that allow us, you think, the right amount of time to work with the county?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The information that we have received from the county is that they will be ready for us in 2020 if they are if they have their election system certified and are ready to take us in 2020, I think it's a good opportunity for us to go forward and consolidate our election with them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is a an election cycle that is not city wide, it's the even district. So I think it's a good testing ground at that at that time for us to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in your opinion, if we did it in 2018, that would put you guys in a little bit of chaos.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it would put the county in a little bit of chaos. Our election cycle for 2018 started on January one, 2017. So we are already in the middle of our election cycle and we've already started the process working with candidates campaign finance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think right now our 2018 election would be best held with the city clerk's office.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you for for that. I, I support the 2020 timeline. I want to thank the city attorney for providing us with a detailed report. And I know that that has been a big question if Long Beach actually had to do this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it's great to have that clarity. I also you know, I think my two concerns is making sure that we go with the 2020 timeline and making sure that we're actually working with Lexi and with the school board and that before this item come back for its final vote, that we actually have some some clarity on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'where everybody is in their election process and that we're working as a city holistically moving that stuff forward. And you did clarify that this we can take this vote today and then it'll come we can put it back into the Elections Oversight Committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would bring back the resolution, adopting the plan, and to request us to prepare the ordinance. It maybe be it would be my recommendation that we move forward with obviously what I've recommended tonight. And then when the motion came back or the resolution came back, adopting adopting that resolution at the time I came back with the draft'",
        "'speaker_7': 'ordinance to the entire body, I think would be the time that if necessary or if that's the desire of the council to send it to the Election Oversight Committee for further discussion. Or you may pick just specific items that you want to discuss.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we would bring the entire thing, all the draft back to the council to bring them an up to date and tell them where we are on this. And at that time, if that at the Election Oversight Committee or whatever committee the council decides to send it to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We'd be happy to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what is the timeline that we need to work within if we go with the 2020?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Very good. The under SB 415, the council has to adopt a plan by before January 1st of 2018. We believe that the resolution we would bring back to you is kind of the 5000 foot view of what your plan is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Your plan is to implement the change and to move to the statewide primary and general election in 2020. The the details of the plan are to be determined. We would be working with that. So we would come back to you as we prepare that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not sure we can get to it by the end of the year, but early 2018 we would have the resolution. Are the ordinances in front of you maybe after the holidays for you to consider and we would have everything in place hopefully no later than spring of 18 so that we would be prepared for 2020.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. So we have from now until spring of 2018 to finalize that plan, working with the clerk, working with NBCC and School Board as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I say that that's optimistic on when we would have it. We have until obviously 2020 to get everything we need to have it everything in place. I have reached out and spoken to the Long Beach Unified School District and to Long Beach City College.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They are aware of this item tonight. I have told them that depending on the action of the council, we would be following up with them after this evening to keep them updated and then into the process. One of the concerns for the school district, for example, is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The November election. They adopt their budget, I'm told, in December. And so having a new person coming in, either the night of the budget adoption or the first week after that may cause them some issues. So they want to talk to us about the impact of those changes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you for answering the questions. I just want to say, you know, that this is, I think, a move in the right direction. I think we have a lot of hope that aligning our election cycles will increase voter turnout.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know we've had voter turnout as low as 10%, as high as 40%, and that the highest is whenever we have it in June and November. And so as much as we can as a city, I know that our our city clerk has spent a long time and for the last three city clerks, it's been a long'",
        "'speaker_5': 'time trying to make sure that we're engaging with as many residents as possible so that, yes, African-Americans, Latinos, that the diverse population is fully engaged in our election cycle. And so I think that this absolutely is the right move, and I urge my colleagues to support this as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Count summary Rango.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gray averaged a disparity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Councilwoman Mango. Skip to skip you. I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So thank you. Who. Who prepared this report was this city attorney's office? Yes, it was. I think you did a did a pretty good job at justifying whether or not the city of Long Beach qualifies as a as a city under as SB 415 in terms of the 25% decline.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would you mind walking us through the methodology here for a moment? I'm going to. We asked the city if we're talking about the math on the 25%. That's why I went to law school.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The the city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We gave her the numbers and asked her to verify these numbers. And so if there's specific questions on the turnout or the years of the of the numbers, they provided those numbers. Well, I think it's what it does is it presents a strong case for not if, but when.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. It narrows the conversation to make it very clearly that we we do meet this threshold that's that's required here. And it's and it's not even close between 25% and some of the percentages that I see here. So I think it's important because this is a really important debate for our city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it's important that the city understand our residents understand how far we compared to the 25% decline in turnout between and alignment with the state with the June, November versus our local turnout. So walk us through your methodology.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we. We used numbers provided to us by the Registrar Recorder's office in Los Angeles on voter turnout for all the elections in this item to to use as a base for our comparison. And then we used also our own statistics for our turnout over the last four election cycles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you can see that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Clearly fall under that 25% threshold in elections where it was not a citywide election and it was maybe just one or two districts. We took that into account when we were doing our math. I know that questions come up and it was the total voters that were involved in that election that we used as our base for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this statistical analysis. So everything is even across the board. Is there any particular election that you had questions on?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, not specifically. So the numbers that I see here, it says the percentage difference between the city's district primary election turnout and four statewide general election average is as follows. I see 68% decline in 2010. So between the states turnout and our local turnout was a 68% difference, way higher than 2576 in 2012, 66 in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And just as recent as 2016, a 75% difference in turnout. Now, I know that there's been a lot of conversation about what we can do to increase participation. SB 14, whether it was popular or not. The title of it was the Voter Participation Act.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is one of the simplest things we can do to simply ensure that voting is simple and easy and more people participate in the civic process. That's something that support. Therefore, I think the question I can support staff's recommendation because it allows us time to to prepare for that, submit this plan and get our affairs in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'order by 2020. It wouldn't make any sense by 2018. My final question, city manager or city attorney, when do we have to evaluate any potential fiscal impact here? We since this is required by state law, I think that the clerk is going to depending on the action of the council tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When we come back, not with the resolution, but with the ordinance. We could certainly, I believe that would give us enough time to talk about the fiscal impact. One of the unknowns is, as the clerk had mentioned, the county, if they're ready for us, that's one cost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If they're not ready for us, that's another cost. If we're we're doing a two vote Tuesday on both the June or the March and the November dates, you're looking at significant costs similar to what you're probably incurring now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So we anticipate cost would likely be similar, but we will have an opportunity to vet that out some other time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will we will know more as we get closer to 2019 and 2020. It's hard to make that call right now because the county does not have their voting system in place. So we don't know what our share of that will be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We only know what it has been historically. And I don't think that's going to be a fair representation of what it will be in 2020 if their new election system is in place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think it gives us time. This motion gives us time to to get this right. And I think fundamentally, this just. Means, you know, we have an opportunity to state whether more or fewer people should have the right and the opportunity and easy opportunity to vote and determine their own future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that that's I feel really good about staff recommendations, so I'll be supporting that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Yeah, well, for me, it's very simple. It increases voter turnout and it aligns the city of Long Beach with the states and the feds. So I think I'll be supporting this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman. Super. Now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just very quickly, the what we have in place currently would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'An April.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Primary, followed by a June election that will go away no matter what. So if you're in a runoff election, you have six weeks between April and June moving forward. I guess the primary would be in March possibly, and then the runoff would be in November.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is correct. Under SB 415 and the way we need to implement the law, obviously the council would have other options to consider in the future. If there is a, you know, a instant runoff type of situation, you could study you could study different items if that period of time is too long between the two elections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I certainly, as I sit here, realize how long a period of time that would be. It's forever. And so but. SB 415 that's a separate issue for for a different night and a different discussion. But yes, you're absolutely correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The April and June will go away and 2020 we would be on the state's schedule. Okay. Thank you. So we can decide that at a later date. I just thought that was important to bring out right now in terms of transparency.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And a few of us up here have participated in the runoff and that six weeks seems like an eternity. I can't imagine waiting till November, our whole summer in and around the runoff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Imagine. Yes, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I'll be very brief. My, I'm going to be supportive of this item because I think it makes a lot of sense. Number one, I mean, obviously, there's going to be some impacts to our local elections here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But on a national level, I think it's very, very important that California be a strong voice and be relevant on the national electoral process. And so I'm kind of I'm very happy to see that the legislation was passed and there will be move in our primary up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I will agree with Councilmember Supernova's assessment, though, if we're going to have a move the primary up to March and possibly a runoff in November, that can make for some very interesting campaigning dynamics. So but but I will support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Councilman and. Yes, thank you, Mayor, because increasing voter turnout is important, I think, in all our neighborhoods and our residents here, you know, no city matter. But, you know, I'm hoping that we can consider transit transitioning this into to 2020 in order to provide, you know, sufficient outreach and time to those who are, you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'know, coordinate this election. It will be done quick and faster and everyone will be have a chance at least to come out and vote, because that is a very important November is very important, I think, for everyone. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for supporting this counts already. Any public comment saying we're going to go out and cast our vote as we're casting? I just want to also just add I'm very supportive. Mr. City Attorney, I know you worked very hard on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know there was a lot of a lot of work from you and your team. But this is for I think, for a lot of us who have been watching this issue and particularly around the issue of voter rights and ensuring that that that people have access to voting and to ensuring that people aren't voting sometimes 3'",
