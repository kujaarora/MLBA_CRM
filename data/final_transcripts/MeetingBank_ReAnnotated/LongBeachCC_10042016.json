        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. So we're going to go ahead and go right into the study session. Okay. Thank you. So we're going to go ahead and start our our study session. And I'm going to make a few comments just to open us up before we go ahead and turn this over to our city staff to begin the presentation'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And for those who are here, the way this will work is like all special study sessions of the council, like the one we've have today. Our staff is going to begin by making a presentation. I know today's presentation is fairly lengthy and so we're going to go and get through that presentation because it's important information that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'get through and that the council here, then after the presentation, the Council will have the ability to make to ask questions, make comments, and then after that we will have public comment on only issues related to the study session.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the public comment on issues around homelessness and that topic. And then after that, we will conclude the study session and then begin the meeting of the City Council. Okay. Thank you. And so let me just begin by just saying, if you if you just general comments, I think there's no question that this the issue of homelessness'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is an issue that a lot of people have been talking about, not just here in Long Beach, but across the state and across the country. And it's been a part of our conversation for for a long time. We all know that right now the state of California and particularly urban cities like San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, Fresno'",
        "'speaker_0': ', Los Angeles, you name the city, and they are all experiencing challenges as well as opportunities to do work around this issue of homelessness. We know that there is a growing and transient homeless population across the county and across the region.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's been noted, I think, across all of our media. I think we also see it when you talk to folks in our social service agencies. And so that's part of the conversation tonight. In addition, I want to know what you're going to hear tonight, that Long Beach has also been a leader in many areas of building supportive'",
        "'speaker_0': 'housing for the homeless, particularly around veterans, and particularly about working with a lot of our local agencies in trying to access mental health care and mental health services for many of our homeless. But we do know that there are changes, the population moves, there are certain neighborhoods that more than others, I think, feel the impact and are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'beginning to react to that impact and inform the council and the city of that challenge for them. And so hopefully tonight is an inclusive conversation that can engage the community. I want to say that tonight is not somehow the only night that we're going to discuss this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a study session for the council. But there have been already numerous conversations that council members have hosted in their own communities. These conversations happen all the time at our agencies, and I know that our Homeless Service Advisory Commission, which I know the members are here tonight as well, they have this conversation consistently about putting together a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'plan for the future. I'll also say that while we know that the last homeless count that that was completed back in January 2015 showed a decrease in homelessness. The next count, as we know, is this January at the beginning of the year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that will give us some clear data. And a lot of the folks that are here will be involved in that count as to where the city actually is when it comes to this this issue. The Council in the past has adopted a community strategy around homelessness, particularly back in 2010, before most of us were in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'office on this council. And you also may remember that there was years ago, a little over ten years ago now, I believe the city began an effort called the ten year plan to Eliminate or reduce homelessness. This was an effort that began in the city that was not just done in Long Beach, but was actually a national'",
        "'speaker_0': 'initiative, which I know we'll hear some about tonight. And so I think the reason why tonight's important and what I'm hoping that we discuss is not just what has been successful, but what has not been successful. What have we done where the city has fallen short?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What can we do better? I'd love to hear from you. What you think we can do better? And then also looking, moving forward for innovative solutions. What are some of the best ideas that are happening across the country and across the world to address this issue?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also am very thankful to the Homeless Services Advisory Commission and all the community advocates and leaders on this issue that I've been working on this week after week for a very long time, because it's a it's a very important issue, and it's important also for the entire city to be involved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This conversation, not just the advocates and the providers, but also our neighborhood groups, our business community, and certainly the leadership of the city of the city council. Before we we I passed this on also just wanted to just conclude just by saying that as we have this discussion tonight, I know that that this is many folks view'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this as a challenge. And it is it's a it's a it's a challenge that we have to face as a community. But I remind us that every single homeless person has a name. All of them, at one point in their life had dreams about what would happen in their future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They all have parents. They all want to have a better life. And they're all individual people. And so I know it's a lot of us, myself included, we oftentimes talk about the homeless as a as a population. This is a population that is diverse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a population that has also has families and youth and and all sorts of people and veterans as a part of it. And so it's I think it's really important that we remember that we are talking about human beings and that this is a community discussion that at its core should be about helping people in our community'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so with that, I want to thank you for being here tonight. And I want to turn this over to our city staff. Mr. WEST.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Mayor, council members, thank you very much for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Initiating this study session on homelessness. As a city manager, I would like to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Echo the comments that the mayor made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Truly, the issue of homelessness is one of the most significant issues facing all large cities across America. We in the city of Long Beach are blessed to be one of the only to be one of only three cities in the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That have their own health departments. Most cities in California are served by the county.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're especially blessed to have a division devoted strictly to homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is a division in our health department that works very, very closely with our Parks Recreation Department, our public works team, our police department, and our fire departments. We also are especially blessed to have our own Homeless Services Advisory Commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That gives us a lot of policy direction that will move forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm going to introduce the people leading us tonight is going to be our director of Human Services, Kelly Collopy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Along with Theresa Chandler, our homeless services coordinator. So I'm going to turn this over to Kelly for the presentation. Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Good evening, honorable mayor. Council members and our many community members here to participate in this homeless study session. Theresa Chandler, our homeless services officer who many of you met before, and I will kick off with this presentation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'First, I'd like to acknowledge that there is frustration among almost everyone regarding homeless concerns in Long Beach. Some feel the city is not doing enough. They see people on the streets with their belongings and they sometimes feel unsafe.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some are trying to help, but they don't know how. Some are providing resources directly to homeless individuals and are being asked not to. We hear that some are taking on their solution solutions of their own. And some of these solutions are neither kind nor are they effective.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are in a fragile time and the need to make sure we act from humanity. Our hope through this presentation and ensuing conversations tonight is that you all understand what is currently underway in the city. The resources provided with the city can and cannot do regarding persons experiencing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What you can do and our future planning efforts. Teresa will start with providing an overview of what the city and its partners are doing to outreach, respond to and how individuals and families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We asked the Long Beach community what we can do to address homelessness. And they answered. Thinking outside of the box. Working together. Educating and motivating the community as a whole. We must care for each other. Address. Mental health and substance abuse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Provide affordable housing. And I'll be a part of the solution. In order to embrace all of these suggestions, we need to know who the homeless are in our community. People who are experiencing homelessness are individuals, families with children, persons with disabilities, veterans, domestic violence survivors, unaccompanied youth, seniors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are grandparents. They are parents. They are brothers. They are sisters, their sons and their daughters. Every person has a unique set of circumstances and a life story which makes the topic of homelessness a complicated one at best.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city of Long Beach has a robust system of care to address the needs of this diverse population. As you can see from this graphic, our continuum of care has many partners bringing together the core services needed by our population experiencing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city's Department of Health and Human Services is the backbone to these efforts in Long Beach. Applying each year to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known as HUD, to resource these services. The Long Beach Continuum of Care is an integrated and coordinated system that provides various services, including street outreach, intake and assessment, emergency'",
        "'speaker_1': 'shelter, transitional housing, permanent housing and supportive services. I will go further into the definition of these later in the presentation, but each household has a unique set of needs and the system is designed to identify the appropriate services for each household.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This collaborative group of service providers has the ability to meet those needs, in part to being designated a unified funding agency by HUD in 2014. Given only to the highest quality continuum, continuum of care in the country. Long Beach is one of four U.S. phase out of 400 continuum nationwide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This status allows the flexibility to address the unique needs of our community. We do this by using best practice models that our client centered increase access to housing and demonstrate positive, measurable impacts. This Ufa status also allows us to seamlessly coordinate services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We use data to evaluate how well we are accomplishing our objectives and goals, which in turn allows us to better understand who we are serving. Furthermore, we are able to develop policy and procedures that inform decision making based on real time data.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Multi-Service Center, located at 1301 West 12th Street, is an innovative best practice model and has been copied by other communities. The Multi-Service Center serves as the one stop shop for homeless services citywide. Over a dozen of our partner agencies operate at the Mercy, working together to holistically address the needs of those accessing the center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks to $2 million in support from Los Angeles County Supervisor Donna Navy, the MSI was completely remodeled two years ago and is a beautiful, welcoming location for people to receive services. We also thank the port for their ongoing support and we encourage others to come out and visit the center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The MSI provides a range of services from basic needs such as meals, meal, transportation, shower facilities to assessments of overall needs, to understanding the current living situation of each person that walks in the door and getting getting them on a housing plan that ultimately leads to a long term housing solution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now I'd like to take a moment to review this list of active and engaged community partners who are part of this system of care. I would like to ask our partners who are present today to please raise their hands.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also want to acknowledge our continued care board members and our our Homeless Services Advisory Commission so all of you can raise your hands. And I can't continue with the presentation without without saying thank you and giving you a warm hand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We would not be where we are today without those that advocated for our division in our department historically and and today as we go forward. So thank you for your service and dedication. A key partner in our success in providing permanent housing is the Housing Authority, which also falls under the umbrella of the Health and Human Services'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Department. The housing authorities impact on homelessness is in, which is substantial. They set aside 701 vast vouchers for veterans, which is like Section eight for veterans, 98 housing choice vouchers, also Section eight, specifically for people experiencing homelessness and provide rental assistance for 201 people who need a combination of housing and services to live independently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, the Housing Authority is faced with challenges that are out of their control. 486 people with vouchers are actively searching for an apartment and cannot find a place to live at this moment. Long Beach has a 2% vacancy rate making finding a home very competitive as it takes an average of six months to secure a unit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Another one of our many partners is a Long Beach Police Department who supports the city's outreach team in locating and engaging people. The Quality of Life Unit is a best practice model. The unit partners with a department of mental health clinician to connect people to services and housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to take a moment to talk about Fred. Fred, who had been homeless for more than 15 years and living on the streets of Long Beach. He was very well known to our outreach and quality of life and West Division officers and had always refused any services or assistance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City staff and the police department never gave up on Fred and kept up their encouragement and visits until he decided to change his life and accept help. It took 11 long months to find a permanent home for Fred.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They were filled with long applications, background checks, multiple emergency housing placements and several rejections from landlords. But Fred's determination paid off, and he signed his first lease in more than 15 years this past June. Fred will tell you that he did not make this commitment to change alone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was when other people also made that commitment to him that his odds really improved. Fred Story is one of many successful housing placements here in Long Beach. Outreach and engagement are an essential part in building a relationship with people on the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This can be a lengthy process and take multiple contacts. The city has currently only two full time employees to respond to more than 100 requests for outreach per month, which does not include existing efforts for identified hot spots for areas throughout the city such as riverbeds, parks, beaches and wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our outreach team works daily to connect and engage people who are living without a home. They visit under bridges, along trailheads, on street corners and alleys, in parks, along the freeways and other locations where people take shelter in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are reaching many of the places that that others often overlook or ignore. They work closely with our City Partners Park Rex and Marine Public Works, the police department and the fire department to bring quality services to people who are homeless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Their level of humanity and compassion for for everyone they meet is completely unmatched. Along with the increased volume of calls to the health department, other city departments are also seeing an uptick, seeing an uptick in requests, which in turn is increasing the pressure on the city wide response system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For example, the health department will initially do outreach and engagement to a hotspot or a particular encampment. The area can require multiple visits by outreach and police to to truly evaluate, evaluate what's happening with the people staying there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We often visit a site multiple times to engage. If the area needs to be cleaned of debris and unattended belongings. The city is legally required to post a notice of the cleanup for up to three days. The notice states that the area is to be cleaned and that any belongings left will be removed from the area by'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a specific date on the day of the cleanup. Street outreach returns to reengage any people at the site to offer transportation, emergency housing, and any linkages to services that may be requested. Once an area has been cleaned, any items identified as personal belongings are then collected and stored up to 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Another notice is posted with information on how to retrieve the items from the storage. Cleanups can cost anywhere from $1000 to $50000, just depending on the size of the effort. And there are multiple large scale cleanups each year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Resources go very quickly. The city is often asked to move people or to clean up homeless encampments more quickly than the regulations allow. We adhere very tightly to the regulations because other cities. Other cities who have not have been subject to lawsuits leading to court oversight or requirement that remove local control of the situation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As we have learned from watching surrounding communities, we do not take these ordinances or rules lightly in an effort to avoid potential lawsuits. The demand on the continuum of care system is substantial. The Multi-Service Center provides services for an average of 1100 individuals and families per month in 2016 for a total of 13,829 client contacts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Street Outreach Team receives approximately 100 requests for outreach each month, and there was a rise in the requests for coordination to address homeless homelessness among city departments, county departments, nonprofit partners and faith based agencies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The budget for the city's homeless services is approximately $10.9 million this year. These funds come from a number of different sources. HUD is the primary funding source at $7.5 million for the continuum of care grant. However, the city has been successful in leveraging other funding sources, such as the Community Development BLOCK, grant emergency Solutions, grant county and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'City Funds, private foundations and donations to the Mayor's Fund to support the continuum of care system. The Homeless Veterans Initiative, a grant funded by the Los Angeles County Supervisor Duncan Harvey, has been an important funding source and has been instrumental in ending veteran homelessness in our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Initially a three year project, the grant was renewed for five years as a result of the extraordinary outcomes in the last year alone. These funds have been critical in helping 300 veterans find a permanent home. The Mayor's Fund for Homeless has also been important in providing us flexibility to achieve our results.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This fund, made up of community donations, supports programs that help fill the gaps in the service system. These funds have assisted with job training and placement services, childcare for families, medical screenings and move in assistance. This year, the funds are being used for family reunification.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city appropriated one time funds of $380,000 from the general fund this year and $500,000 in funding to support rapid response across the city. The age funding to $250,000 of that will go to the fire department to implement a medically staffed rapid response vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other $250,000 will go to the police department to support response efforts with our other city partners. The use of police resources will be coordinated by the Health Department in conjunction with the $380,000 for health, parks and Recreation and public works to provide improved response to calls for assistance in the community, including more outreach and cleanup response'",
        "'speaker_8': 'capacity. These resources are specific to outreach response as the demand is significant. When looking at our budget overall. Please note that a majority of our funding goes to direct services for the continuum of care funding. Over 85% of the funds are for housing and supportive services.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The remaining amounts support system wide administration planning and data collection. The slide shows the continuum of care program and how those resources are allocated. The bulk of our funding, $3.6 million annually goes to permanent housing options support services, which include outreach, housing, location, case management, house retention, housing retention, health care, employment training, linkage to income supports, mental'",
        "'speaker_8': 'health settings, abuse treatment and child care receives about $1.3 million. Transitional housing programs, which support people and families as they transition to permanent housing, receives another 1.1 million and $780,000, goes to rapid rehousing programs, which provide short term rental assistance to the newly homeless.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The remaining $600,000 supports compliance and planning activities, data collection and program evaluation combined.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are a range of housing options available for people in Long Beach. We have 257 year round emergency shelter beds. People tend to stay no longer than 90 days in a short term lodging. The 337 transitional housing beds are designed to support people as they move toward permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The maximum stay is two years. Rapid rehousing provides housing and short term rental assistance that assist people to quickly access housing. This also ends at two years. The 1452 permanent housing beds provide long term housing for homeless individuals and families who have a disability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Support services are provided to help people remain in their homes. Currently in Long Beach, 93% of the permanent housing and 96% of our rapid rehousing is occupied. Our affordable housing partners in Long Beach have taken on the challenge of creating permanent housing to mean to meet the need in our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, can you go back in that? Can you just repeat those numbers later and see them on that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On what the percentage was. Again, just.'",
        "'speaker_1': '93% of our permanent housing and 96% of our rapid rehousing is occupied.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So our affordable housing partners in Long Beach have taken on the challenge of creating permanent housing to meet the need in our community. One of these partners is century villages at Cabrillo, a 27 acre campus community committed to breaking the cycle of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are 20 service providers located on site 572 affordable homes, over 1000 residents on any given night, and over 2000 people served per year. The Housing Authority has been instrumental in partnering with developers to create affordable housing with a preference for previously homeless households.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Examples include Long Beach and 21st Street with 40 units and the Palace Hotel 13 units. There are also some that are that are in the development stage, including anchor place that will have 120 units at the Villages at Cabrillo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is currently under construction. And and the Beacon, which is another 106 units, which is scheduled to begin in early 2017. Homeless impacts go beyond the city boundaries, making regional coordination critical to addressing the issue. These regional partnerships assist us in accessing resources in Long Beach, as well as to connect people who are not from Long'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beach to resources in their community. This means that no one is getting turned away if they are seeking services, but they are connected to the appropriate resources across the region. These partnerships allow us to build a more effective system throughout southern Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In addition, L.A. County has developed 52 comprehensive initiatives to actively address homelessness. They are working to address how these can be resourced, and Long Beach City staff and partners are active participants in the conversations. Other successful regional partners include the Council of Governments through its Gateway Cities Cities Initiative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Coordinated Entry System and the Homeless Family Solution System. The Gateway Cities Initiative is divided into four planning areas across the region. Through this effort, staff connect homeless households to appropriate regional county resources and housing in Lakewood, Signal, Hill, Hawaiian Gardens and Avalon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach is helping increase the capacity of those cities to help them address the needs of their homeless population. The Coordinated Entry System and the Homeless Families Solutions system provide a seamless system of care, addressing the needs of homeless individuals and families by supporting their ability to access services and connect to support systems in their communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is also a winter shelter in Long Beach. This is funded annually through the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority from from December 1st through March 15th. This program provides shelter services and linkages to housing through the inclement weather season.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are about 200 beds during that winter's shelter season. All of these resources and coordinated efforts have led to an overall reduction in homelessness. Based on the last two point in time counts. The point in time count as a count of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons on a single night in January.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'HUD requires that continuum of care conduct this count every two years. Our next count is scheduled to take place on Thursday, January 26th, 2017. We rely heavily on approximately 300 volunteers to take part in this important event. Based on increased calls for outreach, response and trends seen in neighboring communities, we do not anticipate seeing a decrease in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our next count. Our most notable reduction has been among veteran homelessness. The city of Long Beach has a no wrong door approach to find and house our homeless veterans regardless of housing, health or discharge status. Partners, including the Long Beach VA Medical Center, the Health Department, US Vets, Mental Health America and 1736 Family Crisis Center work very'",
        "'speaker_1': 'closely to provide a system of care to veterans who are homeless and seeking services. We were able to house 355 veterans reaching functional zero, which means any homeless veteran who is seeking housing can be housed. The team provides emergency shelter, transitional and permanent housing, access to housing vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Prevention funds. Deposit and rental assistance and case management. We identify new homeless veterans during daily outreach visits. We know who they are and we are working to house them. It's an ongoing process, but for any Long Beach veteran who becomes homeless, there are resources and housing available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me actually just pause right there for a second. So I just want to just note that I don't want to let that moment pass either. I think it's really, really incredible to see the work that's happened around housing veterans who have become homeless.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we I know we, along with a lot of our partners, announced this initiative probably maybe a year and a half ago or so. And it was a part of a national initiative that actually the first lady kind of took on through the White House.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And working with HUD, working with the villages, working with U.S. vets, working with the Veterans Administration Hospital and all of our partners. And just miracle work has happened around this work of getting every single veteran that is looking for housing an actual place to live.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just want to if we can all just give to all of our partners that were involved, a just huge round of applause for their work and in doing that. As we all know, that that doesn't mean that veterans still don't fall into homelessness or there still isn't a challenge there because it's still the case'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But we know that there has been a huge amount of of energy that has gone in and out. I will tell you that our health department team and Kelly, they have heard consistently from from us on this issue, and they have done just amazing work in leading this initiative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just wanted to thank all of you before you moved on on that, because it is a huge accomplishment. What you guys have done there. Thank you. Continue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. So the ten year plan. And first, I'd like to acknowledge we have our co-chairs of the ten year plan in the audience. So, Mike Murray, could you please stand? See here. There you are. And Steve Peck from U.S..'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. So in 2008, a large collaborative effort of over 200 community stakeholders made up of service providers, businesses, faith based and faith based partners developed a ten year plan to prevent and end homeless in the city. A lot of work went into this report.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It included a large number of recommendations for the city to take on a large a lot of innovative ideas and different things to try. This was presented to City Council, but at that time it was not adopted. Endorsements there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Has it been funded? So there has been a plan and it's been a sort of a guiding a guiding conversation. But throughout this time, there has not been a lot of additional resources put toward a number of those recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who else was in it? Who else participated in that planning processes in the room? Okay. Thank you. However, progress has been made. Well, originally so it was initiated in 2005 by Mayor O'Neill. And what came out of it was five key community strategies that were adopted by the City Council in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The strategies were specifically focused on housing, economic stability, supportive services, community involvement and outcomes in evaluation. Through these strategies, the city steadily reduced the number of people experiencing homelessness throughout the city and effectively targeted resources to those with the greatest needs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're going to go through each of the goals and some of the outcomes that have happened to date. So go one housing from 2009 to 2016. Over 800 permanent supportive housing beds have been created, bumping the number from 630 to 1452.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the same period, $3.5 million was allocated to Long Beach for rapid rehousing. In 2014 and 2015, the city itself facilitated the preservation of 1369 affordable units at risk of converting to market rate, which resulted in the extension of affordability for those housing units for the next 55 years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A total of nearly 2000 units have been preserved since 2008. As mentioned earlier, a number of housing developments are also underway to support homeless and people with mental illness at the Beacon Place, Anchor Place and others in the villages of Cumbria.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In looking at goal too. In 2015 alone, over 6700 individuals accessed Goodwill Slack's job programs and Gateway Pacific. Gateway served almost 2400 people to support connection to employment. This is a total of over 9000 people in one year receiving employment support.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When people come through the door of the Multi-Service Center, they are not only connected to Goodwill and Pacific Gateway, they are also connected to mainstream benefits, including Social Security, health insurance enrollment and benefits from the Department of Public and Social Services in an effort to get people reconnected to income sources.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Go three are the supportive services goal. We've already discussed many supportive services that are in place in throughout Long Beach. Others include an increase in the mobile support mental health teams, which we call SB 82 street teams from the County Department of Mental Health.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The children's clinic now has a mobile health clinic available to reach individuals who are living on the streets in Long Beach. We are engaged in discharge planning from hospitals and jail to ensure people are not released into homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we have increased outreach efforts overall, which has made a significant impact on reaching people who are living on the streets. Go for community involvement. We've been increasing community involvement and it's crucial to addressing homelessness holistically. Beginning in 2012, the city began increasing community engagement and building a governance structure for the continuum of care.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Continuum The Continuum of care board is made up of stakeholders in the community from different sectors, including the business improvement districts, public and private partnerships, our faith based community, the Long Beach Unified School District, and those who were formerly homeless.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's also a homeless service advisory committee whose members were appointed by the City Council and the mayor to represent each council district. All of these partners have deep ties in the community and committed to finding a solution to end homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And go five outcomes in evaluation. The use of real time data is essential to appropriately evaluate and accurately understand the story. The city operates the homeless management information system that all partners are required to utilize to track, plan information and to coordinate care plans.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The system not only connects all of the partners, it also helps us to highlight what we do well in areas for opportunity. Overall, the Long Beach system of care has been built with intention to specifically address the needs of our unique community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also recognize that there are areas for growth and opportunity, which is why this session is so important and hearing from you is so important for future planning. We do have some challenges. Our city is facing multiple challenges in addressing homelessness and things are not getting easier.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One key challenge is the increasing rents across the city. Apartment owners are choosing to increase rent and are asking people out to move out if they cannot afford them. This is leading to a crisis for families and seniors in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'More and more are being displaced. The amount of our Section eight vouchers is governed by HUD's fair market rates and are not as high as local rents in Long Beach. But our housing authority has recently negotiated exceptions to these rates and allowed it for a higher payment in hopes that apartment owners will increase acceptance.'",
        "'speaker_8': '60% of the housing stock in Long Beach consists of single to one single two one bedroom apartment, which limits the options even more for families with more than four people. We have a 2% vacancy rate in our city, which is very low, and it means competition for housing is an all time high.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is leading to fewer and fewer apartment owners interested in accepting Section eight vouchers. And again, it's we are spending over 490 individuals who are currently looking for housing. Statewide policy shifts and prison jail reforms are also making conditions more difficult.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The loss of redevelopment removed the significant resource for building affordable housing. Prison and jail reforms have left more people on the streets, and many are being released without connection to housing. Others have more significant mental health and substance use issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are not currently being addressed due to lack of resources. We are seeing real increases in drug use on our streets and the drugs are becoming more and more potent and are causing more sometimes violent behavior. Right now, Long Beach only has 14 detox beds available for treatment for low income and homeless individuals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's not actually just for Long Beach. Those are for the region. In addition to these forces, there are higher levels of expectation from everybody in our city. Calls for response, as you've heard, have gone up significantly. Cleanup requests are going up as well and the costs are growing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there's just an ongoing in the new challenges that are showing up. And we're doing our very best to address them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just going to talk briefly about Lincoln Park. So with the construction that's about to take place with City Hall. Lincoln Park will be closing within the next month. At that time, the project team will fence the Civic Center property to ensure safety during demolition and construction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a three year closure during the Civic Center renovation. The city and its partners have had a significant presence in the park, educating people about the closure as well as outreaching to connect them to services. More specifically, outreach efforts are being conducted daily by the Outreach Network.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Monthly information sessions were held in the park starting six months prior to the fences going up by the Civic Center Task Force, led by the downtown Long Beach Business Association as the lead and the outreach network, signage informing the public of the park's closing has been posted around the park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Messaging regarding the park's closing is being distributed via social media outlets. Fliers have been placed on the fences and are regularly, regularly passed out downtown. Outreach and presentations have been have been made to neighborhood associations to inform residents of the construction project and timeline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the city is also exploring alternative options for people to go at their own will, of course.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're going to shift. We're going to shift from from the services we have been providing to start to take a look about what a system looks like and how we can all contribute. There are many causes of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As you can see on the left side, what you'll find is those who when they walk in the door, those are the reasons at the very beginning, you know what they state is the reason that brought them to homeless.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you'll see loss of jobs evicted by a family member, abuse at home, incarceration. On the right side, you'll find that those things that have been in their lives are present in their lives that also contribute. So it may not be that that at that time the reason, but the many other reasons why people end up homeless'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Given that this is the case, we have to think in terms of a comprehensive approach, focusing on just one thing, one, not solve the homeless issues now or in the future. Our current focus right now is on the red area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's what's in front of us. It's where what everybody is focused on right now, how do we intervene and address what we're seeing right now on our streets? And there are many things that we can do. Street outreach and engagement, providing life skills and job skills, emergency transitional, permanent housing, much more mental health and substance abuse care'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Ongoing supportive services, job skills training. There's a lot that we can be doing. But what we're facing now is that this is the most difficult and expensive time to work with individuals and families. It's why I have got Code Red, because we'd rather stop providing service now and provide it when it's easier to provide.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we keep people from entering homelessness. People are living in their cars, are on the streets, are experiencing much higher levels of disenfranchisement. Mental health conditions in substance abuse, addictions. There are multiple points in which we could proactively prevent homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We call this upstream. So that's the green and the yellow. And so what we really want to be focusing on is the green. And we'll talk a little bit more about that. We want to start with our support of our youth and our young adults, particularly those transitioning out of foster care.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Youth who are learning healthy have employment options, strong positive relationships, a place to live, are safe in their homes and communities they don't generally own. They don't generally end up homeless either as youth or as adults because they're experiencing success.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Seniors who have support to stay in their homes, resourced to live and affordable housing options are also less likely to become homeless. We can help you with the many things that we can do to help, to prevent. So more housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Housing for folks who need it now. But making sure that we have housing throughout the lifespan that is affordable. Mental health treatment is absolutely essential. Los Angeles County provides mental health and substance use treatment for Long Beach, either through direct service or by contracting providers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These services are not funded by the city. All mental health service within our city is provided by L.A. County. The Department of Mental Health is co-located at the Multi-Service Center to take referrals into our system. We really appreciate them as a partner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mental Health America is also funded through our continuum of care and the Department of Mental Health to provide treatment and supportive housing for homeless individuals in our community. Substance use treatment is also a key area of need. There are currently only 14 detox beds and many of these in Long Beach and most are not language specific.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Most detox take place takes place in emergency rooms or in jails. If criminal activity is present, most other substance use treatment is provided for those coming out of the criminal justice system. As there is additional funding for these individuals through HB 109 and probation funding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We continue to need additional housing and supportive services options such as child care and sufficient health care. So how can you help? How can the community help? So if we're focusing as far upstream as possible at the very early prevention, the key ways to help are supporting your schools with volunteering and mentoring, providing internships and learning opportunities'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for high school and college, connecting with individuals at different in difficult times. When you see someone struggling, connect, be aware of signs of mental health and substance use and help connect to treatment, provide jobs locally. The community can help in so many ways in our great city and we could start out by working together.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It really gets everybody back on track to success and then we hopefully won't see people coming back. When we look at late prevention, meaning not yet homeless, but just on the verge and intervention, which is what we'll be doing now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We realize that there are so many good hearted people and organizations in Long Beach who want to help individuals and families, but often that help doesn't support a community solution providing food, clothing, tents, money, etc. to individuals in parks or on the streets and under bridges.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It helps that individual for that moment or that day, but does not help them in the long term. We want to connect people to services to get them off the streets and into housing and services. And we need your help.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our next to slide show, you see a number of ways to truly support those who are homeless in the community. We ask that you donate funds and gift cards for services like haircuts or legal services to organizations who are serving people who are homeless.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Volunteer to help move people in. Build a support network for people who are nearly housed. Help connect people with job skills and or employment opportunities. Sponsor furniture or other needed items for those who are moving in and have no furniture.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Donate to the Mayor's Fund for Homeless in your utility bill or on the city's website. The power of everyone in this community coming together would be completely awesome. Oh, and by the way, the MSD says they need towels.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a shameless plug because a lot of people come to shower and they need more towels. Sorry. So potential funding opportunities within our city. The city will be looking at a number of creative funding strategies, including easy ways to donate, such as parking meters designated for homeless electronic donation options, increased opportunities through the mayor's fund, social'",
        "'speaker_8': 'impact bonds and pay for performance strategies, as well as ongoing engagement and negotiation with the county regarding access to resources as they engage in growing its fund base for the housing, mental health, substance abuse and other supportive services.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Long Beach Continuum of Care is a best practice model nationally. We had a visit from the Appropriations Committee recently because they wanted to learn about how we coordinate so closely and how we've made so much progress and how we've used our unified funding agency strategy because they're still learning from us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, we do not rest on our laurels in any way. We are aware that there are many innovative practices nationally to support homeless, and we're tracking on them. Unfortunately, many of these that sound really cool have unintended consequence, consequences that aren't really that positive.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We want to make sure we're paying attention to this, that we do not end up in similar situations here. We're working closely with Los Angeles County to create opportunities for mental health and substance abuse diversion from criminal justice settings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're looking at expanding opportunities at the Multi-Service Center and implementing clean teams to support the removal of materials such as couches and materials and mattresses in the city's alleys and parking lots. The one time $880,000 would be very helpful this year in supporting increased outreach in response.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How are these resources will go fast because it does clean up. Costs are expensive. Looking forward, we have the perfect opportunity to develop a new, actionable plan to address homeless in Long Beach. It will take dedicated resources well beyond our current what our city currently invests.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Previous planning has been unfunded, so results were limited. In an upcoming summit that includes a broad array of community, stakeholders will provide a perfect opportunity to continue to build on the five key strategies outlined in the ten year report recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This will allow many to come together to generate solutions. This is currently being scheduled for spring 2017. In addition, we have a few stellar with us this year to help look at innovative practices and funding strategies to address homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Views fellows who spent over 15 years in the private sector and bringing those skills to government for one year. I'd like to have Sharon stand up. Jim Moran is our Fuze fellow. You'll be seeing a lot of her in the next year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd also like to welcome Veronica join you see to it Veronica it's the front runner goes or other Hughes fellow. This year she'll be working on My Brother's Keeper and assisting with the Violence Prevention and Equity Office's. So we're very excited to have them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thank you to the mayor and the Council for this generous public and private support to provide this incredible resource in these efforts. We will also be hosting community conversations. We want to focus on the earliest prevention opportunities as well as the best ways to intervene in homelessness now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It will be working over the next. We will be working over the next 6 to 9 months, including the summit and all of our other work together and engaging with you to build and to and to build upon the ten year plan and to build a plan for our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Supporting people experiencing homelessness and addressing the impacts of homeless on our streets is a true balance in our community. Homelessness impacts so many at so many different levels. It is truly a community issue and requires full community engagement engagement to reach a solution based on participation in a number of community meetings and conversations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What I hear most is what is the city going to do about it? The city isn't doing enough. The city teams work tirelessly every day to respond to calls and to house people. We are one of the few cities in California that address homelessness in such a comprehensive way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Most other cities are just trying to figure it out. There just aren't enough city staff or enough funding to meet the community's expectations. If the expectation is that it's up to the city to make the change, it will take a while because we'll have to generate those resources on our own.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We want to acknowledge many of you in the room who have taken the call to action to make a difference. It really has been my pleasure to work with you so far. All of us in this room, all of us in our great city, need to be part of the solution.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are the community. It would be easy for, as you speak today, to point a finger at the city and express your concerns. This will keep us and status quo. It won't forward any progress. You can also suggest solutions you believe the city should take on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But this continues to expect the city to be the only solution. In addition, many solution provided are focused on moving people or criminalizing homelessness. And this just is not allowable as it puts the city at great risk of lawsuit and court oversight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Instead, we challenge you that when you come to the microphone and when you speak in community meetings that you commit what you yourself will do to be part of a positive solution. Ten Homelessness in Long Beach. We've provided a number of suggestions earlier.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As an apartment owner, provide units for Section eight and be flexible in your rents so that people, particularly families and seniors, can remain housed. Businesses and hotels provide job opportunities and training. Sponsor and organize volunteer groups. Donate meaningfully to organizations, individuals and families.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Volunteer and support organizations who serve the homeless. Sponsor an individual or a family as they are moving in. By creating a moving kit list of opportunities. As long individually we can make progress. But we are only truly powerful when we come together for our community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you for your time tonight. That concludes my report and we are open for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. That was a great presentation to you. I know your entire team. I know you worked very hard on that. We're going to now turn over to the city council, all have comments and questions and then we'll go to the public after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me start with Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I just want to start out by making a few comments to city staff and thanking you for the presentation tonight, hearing what you do and the broad level of service that's involved in your operation. I think it's very important for our community to hear.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've had an opportunity to hear it several times and I do get very frustrated when people operate with assumptions that appear to be misinformed in terms of what the city is doing. So I applaud you for educating all of us tonight and for the education that you've provided to our individual council districts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know that our district has had three community meetings on this topic. Teresa has been at all of them, starting with about a year and a half ago. And recently we had one. We had over 200 and about 250 people there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is a very emotionally charged issue. And I really like hearing what Kelly said in her closing remarks tonight about the challenge that if people are going to raise frustrations about the issue, that they also balance that with what they're willing to commit in terms of their personal resources to finding a solution or a problem.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I look out at the audience today and I'm so appreciative for the many people in this room who have. An unbelievable level of compassion and heart, not just for the people who are going through the difficult times, but also for the city of Long Beach because they're trying to be proactive and be part of the solution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I look at Steve, Larry, I've had opportunities, invited me. My family and I have gone to the U.S., oh, at the first congressional church. And we have served food there and plan to go again. I think about LBJ and the very progressive efforts that they have taken on to address the issue in their community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And of course, Craig's editorial in the press telegram was very moving to me and something that I wish that many people in the city would read. I think about Gio Ferrera's efforts in her community to try to be a change agent.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Allison Crip, Joe Ganim, all of these individuals. Gaylord from my district is here. He's really trying to educate his community. These individuals, among many that I haven't named, are partners to us in this problem. There is a lot of frustration.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I sometimes I read some of the I try not to do it too often, but sometimes I read the social media posts and things about people who say, well, you know what, the city or our Susie Price, you know, she seems like she's still trying to figure out this homeless thing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, maybe we can we can have somebody there who actually knows what to do with the problem. And I always say if there's someone out there that knows how to fix this issue, I would like to know their name.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would like to vote for them. I would like to hug them. I would like to welcome them to the city because this is a region regional problem and we're all trying to work together to figure it out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so all of the people that I just referenced and many others that I didn't are trying to be partners with us as we think more long term. You know, some of the things that we often hear about and I want to ask a couple of questions about it tonight, but some of the things that we often'",
        "'speaker_9': 'hear about are suggestions that people give on how to deal with the situation are one, you know, not legal or to a short sighted, you know, you can't move people from one area to the other. It doesn't really address the bigger problem.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you have somebody that, let's say, for example, needs substance abuse treatment, we need to figure out a way how to get them the substance abuse treatment because moving them from one location to another is really a short term solution for the people that are in the immediate vicinity of the area where the movement is happening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's one of the biggest things that's been really my focus given my background in my career. The substance abuse aspect has been a very concerning issue for me because I don't think we have the resources or the mechanisms to help people get the treatment that they need so that they can start to make some of the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'changes that we were talking about in terms of long term solutions. So I'm always interested in that. So I wanted to ask kind of start off with that Kelly and or Teresa, have we noticed that we've had a rise in the level of folks who maybe are suffering from substance abuse problems?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if so, what opportunities do we have for them to get treatment?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are saying we are seeing an increase in drug use on the streets. The other thing that we're seeing is that the drugs that are being used are causing more erratic behaviors. And so what we're finding is that, you know, as some people are coming to the multi-service center and other places, we're just noticing this river that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'is more and more difficult to to to have conversations and to engage with people. We do need substance abuse treatment. So the county, through its Department of Public Health, provides that treatment through using, you know, Medicaid funding through the state.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But there just are not a whole lot of providers within the city of Long Beach that provide unfunded or Medi-Cal, Medi-Cal substance abuse treatment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do we have any residential drug treatment programs in the city of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Safe refuge. Yeah. Safe refuge. And then there's redgate. Thank you. I don't have the full list here in front of me in Tarzana. Yeah. He'll Hey, everyone, everyone who has been experiencing this and the community will share. There are waiting lists for all of them and they are difficult to get into.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I imagine also that even even if we had more available, which it sounds like there's definitely a need there to provide those opportunities, even if we had those available. I imagine just on my own personal experience. With folks who have had substance abuse problems very close to me, it's hard to get them to actually seek the treatment'",
        "'speaker_9': ', especially an intense treatment like a residential treatment program where you have to go through the detox and all of that. Are there any mechanisms to incentivize treatment? I know that prior to Prop 47, we had drug court, which could incentivize rehab in lieu of a felony conviction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what do we have now? Do we have anything that can incentivize drug treatment?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are not a whole lot of incentives to drug treatment beyond when we're doing outreach and engagement. The more that we build those capacities with folks, we build that relationship. They start to understand that they need it. And then we work to get them into treatment to help support their ability to move, you know, to help them'",
        "'speaker_8': 'maintain their housing. We do use the housing first model in Long Beach, which means that anybody you know that it's not a requirement to be clean before getting into housing. So, so so people will be housed. We can then help support whatever is going on from there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is a community collaborative courtroom that is in Long Beach and they are working to be able to provide some some incentives through that courtroom into treatment, into some connection. We're looking at some other national models as well with the with the city prosecutor and the police department that would be around and offering treatment opportunities in connection'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to treatment opportunities in lieu of citation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now, so if I'm hearing you correctly and this is something I didn't know, so we do offer housing even if someone is under the influence of a substance and maybe hasn't detoxed yet that the housing is still offered.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, housing first is housing first. I mean, that's you know, that doesn't rely on any other it doesn't rely on them changing their lifestyle or anything. It's like we want to make sure people are housed and if that is your most baseline of service from there we help support people moving into other support services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then do we have the treatment and services available for them if they do get into housing to help them go through that transition immediately? We do the detox and the rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't. There are services available and supportive services models, but there's not sufficient. And what we find sometimes that people are in the housing authority or other places like that, they may start falling out of service. So we get people housed and because their substance use is not managed or their mental illness is not managed, and they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'start to fall out of housing. And what we are seeking to do is provide additional services to try and unders to put together a model where we could do additional scattered site support so that those who are in the housing authority or that we're housing through any other Section eight or any other ways to make sure that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we have stronger support systems for them to help them remain in housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a couple of things that we often hear. I'm not sure if my colleagues hear them. I'm sure they do, but I think they're myths. But I'm not sure. Are there, to your knowledge, different cities busing in their homeless and dropping them off in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I get calls about that on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have had those questions. To our knowledge, no people have free will to get on a bus and travel wherever they want to go. But there, to our knowledge, there are no cities that are intentionally filling up bus loads and dropping them off in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And similarly, you talked about vouchers. Can you tell me can you tell us a little bit more who qualifies for vouchers and how many hotels do we have in the city where they can use the vouchers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure, the cons the city contracts with two specific hotels in the city that can use vouchers. Folks that get vouchers through the multi-service center have to come in or come in through the door. They go through a full assessment and they their homeless status is acknowledged and then they receive a voucher and that's for a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's two different vouchers, though. There's hotel vouchers and then there's vouchers for section eight. So that's where there's some confusion that lies.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So the hotel vouchers do is there a priority system for who gets those and how many do we issue?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. So when people are coming in to meet with the case manager and receive it, they start they get on a housing plan. Hotels are used as a bridge to housing. So if there's not an emergency shelter bed available, then that's when a hotel will be used.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And is there a priority for families or veterans when it comes to those vouchers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The families are, ah, they go through the Family Solution Center and they have a certain amount of hotel vouchers that they utilize. And then through the multi-service center, through our case managers, they serve veterans and individuals there. So their Family Solution Center is also co-located at the Multi-Service Center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So everybody is connected in that space.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And how many vouchers are we talking about in terms of the hotel vouchers? What would what's a rough estimate of what we would get?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our team is offering its. What's it? It's fewer than 50.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, it's a small amount.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Fewer than 50 on a monthly basis. Annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'An.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Annual basis. Less than 50 vouchers on an annual basis. So I think that's a myth, too, that we hear a lot about, is that the city, you know, that people are choosing maybe to be homeless because the city is giving out these vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That seems to be an incorrect information. Okay. I'm going to stop asking questions so that my colleagues can ask a few questions. And then I'd love to hear from the public as well, because I could go all night and I won't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia. So I want to just begin by thanking staff. I was impressed and a number at numerous points during your presentation. And I know you have limited resources and it's easy to to say what should be done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But with limited resources, you prove and demonstrate why we were fortunate to have a health department. We're able to do so much more here locally than a lot of the many other communities can do, while still using very little of our general funds resources.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I just want to start off by saying thank you and when you make sure you clap for them. So there was a comment about homelessness as a community. And I can tell you, homeless the homeless community is a community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's we actually have a nonprofit here in Long Beach that they volunteer. It's called Wrap the Kids. They volunteer, they make they knit sweaters and they're made up for the most part of active homeless folks. And I can tell you, they volunteer at higher levels then, you know, then neighborhood activists we've seen for many, many years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they are a community. And we should think of this in this conversation. We should keep it in context that this is these are human beings. So I totally understand when we say what am I willing to do frame our own, you know, our conversation in that in that context, I just have a few questions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, I say few, about four or five. We've been home to the winter shelter, the Long Beach once winter shelter the last four or five years in District nine. And I'm just curious, how many people do we know on hand?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I didn't see it on the slide. But how many people do we typically serve at the winter shelter every year?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So typically, on average, about 200. There's 200 beds at the winter shelter. So the average capacity through the winter, the beds are typically full.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And I know that we're in. It's October now, and winter's winter is coming. Oh, I got to say. I got to say it. So I. I know that. I know that that's happening. What where are we in the process of setting up our our shelter?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know that we typically last few years, we've gotten better at notifying the public and going through that process. But where are we today with setting up the winter shelter?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. Well, the winter shelter is actually funded by Los Angeles County, the Lahsa. And so they release an RFP and then the provider of the winter shelter apply for that RFP. So the city of Long Beach doesn't release that RFP.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not under our purview. We're more of a middle, middle person for for lack of a better term. And so it's October, the RFP will be released soon and then the application the applicants will apply. And so we're in our process through the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city council will be receiving a letter very soon about our process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I know we typically have to like declare an emergency and take all those steps. Right. So so thanks for the update and keep us posted. I had a chance to go to the housing authority headquarters maybe a month or so ago.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was it was really shocking to hear that there's almost 500 people with vouchers ready to be placed. But we haven't found the places to to take them, the apartment owners to actually take them. And I had a sort of off the cuff conversation with property owners today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I you know, I would say there might be some immediate opportunities to help serve these people. And when I think of, you know, the Section eight voucher, I think these are people that are right at the brink that can be helped from slipping into active homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so have we engaged the property owners and talked about what the barriers are and educated them, that we can actually pay a higher amount to make sure these people are are placed? But what what steps would be taken to think creatively about making sure we're using these vouchers?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, the housing authority meets regularly with the apartment associations. They presented every conference that they can get into to share information. They are on first name basis with every owner that is out there that currently takes Section eight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they're working on first name basis for almost every other owner in the city, really seeking opportunities to to create those spaces. In addition, they have negotiated with the Federal Housing Authority to be able to to have an exception payment or acceptance standard, which will allow us to pay more than what the current standard is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in some communities, it can be up to 100, 120% of that standard, which we're hoping it gets us much closer to the actual rents for those apartments. And we believe that that should help in the in the rentals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I would say I would say, you know, based on the conversation I had today, I think it would be be good to just have a brainstorm session. Again, I know it's one thing to meet routinely.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's another thing to have a specific conversation about, you know, how do we turn it up right now and address this need of this 490 people? I think we can. I am hopeful that we can move the needle in five more units immediately.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm willing to call out, you know, the apartment owners and say, help us meet this need. You know, we do a lot of this council to try to make sure things are business friendly to apartment owners and things like that and make adjustments well so that this is an opportunity for the apartment was to step up'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and help the city meet its commitment on homelessness. I would also say with respect to I heard the mention that we do use these vouchers on on hotels. And that made me just think about where we have a number of underutilized nonconforming motels that are being used for a lot of other purposes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Have we explored whether we could modernize or convert those motels into quality transitional housing? And can we use some of those funding to accomplish that, some of the Section eight HUD funding for that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Section eight funding can only be used in a place that has cooking. So a microwave and a bathroom. So. So they could be they could be they could be updated. So sometimes an SRO or a single room occupancy unit don't have those in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The definitions within the city are different. So there's the motels and you could use section eight as sort of efficiency units one by one room units as long as there's cooking in a in a restroom in that room.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have not currently looked into modernization at this point, but we have been approached by a couple of different housing providers and rehab providers who might be interested in that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I'll just close with just some thoughts that I have about this, this entire issue with the loss of redevelopment, that was a significant blow to the local funding that we had to actually develop robust, affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_10': '20% of all the tax increment had to go to affordable housing development. And with the loss of redevelopment, we lost that tool. So we think we need to go back to the drawing board and be more creative. And I know there's efforts around town about this, but I would say, you know, if you were to look at'",
        "'speaker_10': 'an affordable housing conversion, one to have in mind is the Bellwood Arms on Atlantic or across from Halton Park. This place looks fantastic. It is. You know, it's inside and out. And if I were in college, I would love to stay at a place like that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And right next door, the market rate housing. I took a tour of some market rate housing right next door and it was very substandard in the conditions of living and the affordable housing was cheaper and higher quality. I think we need to be smarter about changing the conversation about affordable housing and I completely support that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And secondly, we are a large city and we need we need to make sure we have given honest conversation, inclusionary housing. We need to interconnect density, bonuses, incentives, whatever we can be creative and think of. We need to connect that to inclusionary housing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm okay publicly saying that I support it. Boston. Denver. Sacramento. San Diego. San Francisco. All have inclusionary housing. Long Beach should have a real conversation about it. So that's that's where I'll end. But thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I too only have about 20 questions, so hang tight. I'm kidding. I just want to thank everybody here in the room as well. I know everybody's been working so very hard. I can't even name everybody because it's just been incredible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think together we are a lot stronger and I'm just very proud to see the direction we're headed. And I want to thank, first and foremost our health department. I know you all are working very hard and diligently oftentimes on grant funding and it's tough.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I want to thank you all for your your efforts. So every single inner city employee within the health department. I want to thank you. Yes. So a couple quick questions. And some things have been brought up in the past that I would like to just kind of reopen the discussion to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There have been there has been talk about individuals with pets in shelters that would include animals. And so I don't know where that discussion ended up. Do we know where that's ended up?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We we are shelters do allow pets. We do. Yeah. People can bring their pets along. And our the staff work tirelessly to make sure that people can stay connected to their pets. Many of those pets end up coming home with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, you know, people that's there's a lot of people's support system. And so they become service animals and support to folks. And so it's very important that people can stay connected to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But not all shelters. I mean, some shelters maybe allow pets, but I don't believe all do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the single shelters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Just wanted to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So if we can get a number on that, I'd be good to find out how many shelters do allow, because we hear that coming up a bit. Secondly, in regards to our youth, I know there's been talk about students at Cal State, Long Beach, one in ten are homeless.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's been a big topic of discussion. I believe there had been a grant received by the university last year and also Long Beach City College. I know that there are individuals that are homeless there as well. So what is our discussion around students and what are we how are we working in conjunction with our universities?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're actually working very closely with the university, with Cal State, Long Beach, and also with the City College to address the student needs. So that staff, many of the staff have gone out on a monthly basis to engage with the university and the city college.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm continuing to sit on panels. We're being invited to do presentations, to engage with them, and we're inviting them to be part of our continuum of care general membership team to make sure that we're engaged with not just the colleges, but also with with Long Beach Unified School District as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's great. Thank you very much. And then I, I also have a question on the LGBTQ community within our homeless reporting. So every January when we get this report, do we know how many individuals identify as LGBTQ and what additional resources may be provided to them with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During the the point in time count, that question is not asked.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Is that something we can add? Because I think that would be beneficial.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, we're just starting discussions about different questions that we want to in and include in that point in time count and our Fuze fellow is going to participate in some of that as well. And we really want to gather more information about who our population is and I mean who our community members are and where they're coming'",
        "'speaker_1': 'from. So that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Wonderful. Amazing. Can I add.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One thing to that point before you continue, Councilwoman? So I just want to make sure, because I think that's an important point I've read and I could be wrong, but I read that the national statistics on LGBT, on homeless youth is about 40% of all homeless youth are actually LGBTQ, which is really high versus obviously the current'",
        "'speaker_0': 'population. And so I think what the councilwoman is also speaking to is that there is a there are very special needs within that population on top of the the stress of being homeless. And there are domestic violence. There's issues of what's going on at the home, of not having family support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just I think I'm really glad that Councilman Gonzales brought this up. And I would be interested to just exploring what the best practices are around this question, because I know it's especially true within homeless youth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm glad that got brought up. So, Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you for reinforcing that message. I think it's really key and I'm glad will be including that in our reporting with our Fuze fellows. I'm glad to hear that. And then I know I had brought up there will be a report coming back, I believe, in November.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a number of items that I included in that agenda item that include substance abuse, housing, children and families. In regards to the substance abuse issue, are we looking at any models and can we bring that forward in November with just a couple of models?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That may be I mean, it may be pie in the sky and too costly, but at least if we have some framework around what that may look like, I know Councilwoman Pryce brought up some great points in regards to substance abuse, but I think it's such a national epidemic right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it needs more emphasis. And so it'd be great to get more information back in November related to certain models we can implement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You can make sure that's included.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And then a couple more questions. So I know I believe we talked about this Kelly weekend outreach. What type of support do we have on the weekends?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Currently, the phone line is available. People can call in and on Monday morning, first thing, that phone line is checked and then we conduct outreach throughout the rest of the throughout the rest of the week. Folks can call two, one, one if they need additional supports and they can provide connection to other services as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And there's not any physical outreach being conducted over the weekend, though, so it's just the hotline, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, great. And I think the last question I had was just.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've just been corrected. Mental health America does do outreach. Our city staff does not do outreach and mental health in Marion. Does that make it perfect?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. And then one last question I have is in relation to housing, of course, which is very important. Do we have any idea? You know, a lot of questions have been or topics of discussion have been around families.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course, you had discussed, you know, rents increasing. We have a lot of families that need housing. I've also heard of, you know, artists, teachers. Do we have an idea of what type of demographic could be served best with affordable housing or is it just families at this point?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we know any other specific demographics? I know it's a pretty.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Category so it's certainly going all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I know everybody.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So that the that information we don't have that information right here but we can we can be provided. But really we're looking at the need across all different populations and backgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. Okay. Because I don't know if there's different types of funding models that could be used. I mean, every time we think of affordable housing, we often go towards seniors and veterans, which is great. We definitely need that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think there's also other groups that could be served as well, and maybe there's an easier time in getting funding for those specific groups. That's just the the reason I'm asking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. If you if you'd like more specific information, Patrick, do you have do you have that information where we can get we can come back to you?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That would just a difference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do you want to bring that back in November as well?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We'll just bring it back. We'll bring it back. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's that's an yeah, that's an entirely different subject. Homelessness. And we can come back with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, perfect. Thank you, Pat. And so I also want to just add that I think also our police department, our quality of life team is absolutely incredible. Yes, of course. For them as well. I was just speaking to some downtown residents yesterday at their meeting and touted the great work of our quality of life team.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you are on Facebook and you ever get a chance to go on Officer Brad, few tax page to see real life what he's doing with mint, which many service providers do. But the fact that our police officers are doing this daily along the river, you know, in encampments, just in the trenches, working directly with homelessness, I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'urge you to look at their Facebook pages and see what they're doing. So thank you all for your amazing work and I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Go ahead. Go. Okay. What? Yeah. So I want to also. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Councilmember Pierce, you're up next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Um, so I want to, you know, echo everything that my colleagues have said about thinking, you know, everybody that's been thanked. Everybody that showed up today. Everybody that is trying to help us find a solution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do think that Long Beach, you know, from the conversations I have had, is above and beyond what a lot of other cities have done. And so being thankful for that and then challenging ourselves to be bold and innovative and think outside the box is the best way that we as a community are going to be able'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to, you know, resolve and tackle some of these issues that are not just Long Beach issues, but are regional issues. And so I have obviously a few questions and I think. You know, first want to ask, are there opportunities, training opportunities that the department, the health department or other organizations in the city are doing to engage businesses'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and residents who might come across people that are homeless?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Currently we are getting a lot of questions and requests for training. So we have a mental health first aid training that we encourage anybody to participate in. And we're all also connected to trauma informed care training that we also encourage folks to participate in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that request is coming to us quite often and staff do informal trainings, we go out and present quite a bit, but we are looking further into developing something more formal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I think that a few of my colleagues and I would definitely I know that we're meeting later on in the week and so thank you for that, particularly before Linkin Park closes to ensure that those communities that might not experience as many homeless will have the training and support that they need on how to interact'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and who to call and know what steps to take should that time come? I wanted to ask about the vouchers. I know that, you know, there's the limit on the way around 50 a year. Is there is there a mechanism to increase the number of vouchers for the hotel stay?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. So a mechanism for an increase? Mm hmm. Just money. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just need more resources around that. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And where do the resources come for those hotel vouchers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'County through grants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Through grants. Okay. Yeah. The council vice mayor brought up the sorrows. And I think that this is a conversation we've had and not only with the city, but talking about private developers that might want to, you know, support helping the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there are challenges with the homeless community. And, you know, some ideas have been thrown out there about taking those. SOROS Having a developer buy them and then having the city or an entity within the city provide wraparound services as bridge housing or transitional housing that would last in between 6 to 9 months while they find permanent'",
        "'speaker_5': 'housing since we have a 2% vacancy. What are some challenges to doing that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, certainly right now we don't have the service providers to provide those wraparound services. I mean, we have we have service providers. We don't have the funding to provide those wraparound services. So we would be looking at that and it would be working with the planning department and others around housing and the focus on that and the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and the SRO. So once again, SRO cannot be you cannot use Section eight supports for those right. That you can for you can four motels. And so it's really having a conversation in the city around those specific those specific units and then looking for the supportive resources to make sure that people can stay in and have the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ability to stay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I had a great meeting just today, just happen to be today with Brian from Century Villages. And, you know, that question came up and talking about how much it would cost per unit. So you had a motel that was converted to be able to be used longer term wraparound services, around 1200 at a year per person'",
        "'speaker_5': '. What does it cost that that it would cost to provide wraparound services outside of the housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't have a specific number for that, but we can get back to you with that number.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have another question. It's the city participating in any pharmaceutical takeback events.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, not at this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then one last question. One of the challenges being the clean ups and the fact that, you know, whether it's in Bixby Park or Lincoln Park, that people are leaving some of their belongings in places. I know that we have places for them at the Multi-Service Center.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there a barrier or a reason not to provide things like lockers in areas that tend to have a lot of homeless people around?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sometimes some of the to have lockers. We're not really sure what goes into them. And so it's it's it can be a real security risk. And so that's one of the reasons why we have not moved forward in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do store when when cleanups are conducted. We do provide storage of personal possessions for 90 days and people can go and pick those up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And the last thing I'll say is, I know that you and I have talked a little bit, Kelly, about trying to do something like a day laborer program, you know, as we're talking about all the areas of focus here and economic support.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just look forward to continuing that conversation on how we can partner with organizations like MH or villages to support getting people into some some jobs that will give them integrity as well as a paycheck. And so I look forward to that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. Great discussion. I also want to add my voice to the health department and Mr. Colby and her staff for the great, wonderful work they're doing with help with the homeless. I don't have any questions per say in regards to what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we know basically what what those issues are. But I'm looking at slide number 47 where how to prevent and intervene in homelessness. And we're looking at the various, uh, bullets there that, uh, they provide some assistance and guidance in how to prevent and intervene.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what I see here is it's a multi-jurisdictional effort that needs to take place. We need to we need to work more closely with our partners, with with the county, with the state, with our neighboring cities, because it's always a concern.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I want to acknowledge the presence of a Connie's people from a supervisor cannabis office who is here, because cannabis office has been a very, very supportive friend of the city of Long Beach. And unfortunately, he's termed out and you'll be leaving office very soon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and with him goes Connie. And Connie has been a champion for the city of Long Beach. And everything that we've done in any area, and especially when we're talking about homelessness as well. So I want to congratulate her on her service as a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And having said that, you know, we we have had some discussion about some other ways that we could address it. But one of the questions I was going to ask but it's already been addressed was this whole issue about Housing First, the Housing First model, because I think that that's an important aspect of how we can deal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with homelessness in regards to having. Housing that we need to we need to find that first. I mean, that's, you know, the definition of homelessness is, oh, so we got to find people homes and and when I'm talking about a multi-jurisdictional effort is also a multi community effort that we've talked about affordable housing in regards to maybe'",
        "'speaker_3': 'providing affordable apartment apartments, looking at single remarkable things we're looking at maybe when the next time we have a new development, you know, putting in there some kind of aspect of of affordable accommodations in those areas because that's that's where the problem is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you have a 2% vacancy rate, there's not going to be much out there. And having an increase of vouchers is great but if there's not the of the housing and is not available to people of the largest we want but the but there's not going to be any use for them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have to look at our housing stock. We have to look at housing developments that are going to be coming in to the city where we're basically built out. So there's not going to be a whole opportunity for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the only other way is to build up. And and in the end, I think that when it comes down to homelessness, I think most of them are not looking for handouts. They're looking for hands up hand ups.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we need to change how we we we view and we look at homeless individuals and trying to not help them but perhaps guide them into those areas that that they need support. And because I as an example, there's a major a homeless encampment in my district in Will Springs Park, and out of perhaps 50 individuals that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are there, only one accepted assistance. So that that says a lot about what kind of outreach work we're doing to these individuals and why are so many of the other ones. I'm 49, are not accepting the services, so there's got to be something there that we're not doing right that we need to evaluate, though, when it comes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'down to making an offer, assisting them with their with their homeless issues and the great majority of them not wanting to to accept it. So we need to perhaps reevaluate how we're doing it and and perhaps, you know, be little before we get out there into into the service area, be introspective in terms of what are we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'doing wrong so that we can address their needs a lot better. And as I've said before, I mean, the the there's no stronger commitment to addressing the issue than the commitment that we make as a city with our financial commitment and putting more money into it to help the Health Department and the Homeless Services Bureau from relying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'solely on grants from the state and from the feds and from everywhere else, and institutionalize a lot of these these efforts that we're trying to do out there. And I don't know how we're going to do that. Obviously, taxes is a bad word, although Measure eight passed pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, we need to look at at how we as a community have to have to deal with that and that Slide 44, it basically tells me that that we that that it takes a village and it's going to take a lot more than that as well to address this homeless issue if we want to really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'want it to go away. Jobs, housing, health care, counseling, all that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Hastert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I'll try to be brief. I'm battling a little bit of a chest cold right now. And many of my my colleagues have addressed many of the points that I wanted to address. I want to thank staff for an excellent presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All of our partners, Continuum of Care partners on path. I want to thank my and my homeless advisory commission advisor, Andy Kerr, who was actually here with him pretty regularly. And I thank the mayor for for calling the study session, because this is long overdue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I think as evident from the presentation, we've done some great work and we're doing some great work here in the city of Long Beach. But looking at the numbers, we still have room for improvement. And as we strive for excellence in government, we should be striving for continuous improvement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm really concerned that two outreach workers is not going to get it done for the city. I've said that over and over again during our last budget conversation as well, and particularly when you hear that multiple contacts are needed to the homeless to to actually get them to move to outreach workers 2120 400 homeless in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the city. That math doesn't add up, doesn't make me feel inspired that we're going to get things done and resolve the issues the way they need to be resolved. And I agree with Kelly's point that we all need to be part of the solution, that that's extremely important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jeanine. Councilmember Pearce touched on the need for. More volunteer opportunities. And I think that's something that we need to really, really explore, volunteer and training opportunities. We need to have a boot camp to address this crisis. As I'm looking at this crowd right here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's clearly a sustainable approach to having some volunteers go out there to help with the outreach and to get services and help for those in need. So that's something that I'm looking forward to potentially working on as well as as a solution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When listening to the presentation and all of the comments thus far, it's clear that we need to expand our capacity for for housing and resources to and to be creative in doing so for temporary and long term housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's recently was a bill passed in Sacramento and it was was pretty contentious, but it was SB 1069. Are you staff aware of that Bill right now? It was passed. That was, I guess, the the the quick name for it was Granny Flats that would allow for residential homes, a allow for residential properties to expand on their'",
        "'speaker_2': 'properties and build small apartment units. There was a concern about local, local control there, but that bill passed and was signed by by the governor, believe about a week or so ago that we would talk about expanding capacity and all of us be a part of the solution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is a big one. One way that we can look at doing that and I would love to get some. I know we're going to have a state ledge committee meeting in a couple of weeks next week. No, two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll get a report back on that there. But I think I'd like to get a report back for the full council on that as well, because that that may expand some opportunity. And I want to thank the council for also voting to to send a strong message to Sacramento, asking the governor to declare homelessness as a as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a as an emergency crisis in the state that could and would bring, you know, $100 million or so that could be divided up into various counties and bring resources to assist us. And so we'll continue to work on that and and other funding opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the end of the day, we have to do a gut check as a as a city. Other cities, other public entities are looking at ways to fund homelessness. We brought forth an item that we'd like to see piloted to have parking meters installed throughout the old parking meters installed throughout the city to to help individuals raise'",
        "'speaker_2': 'money and raise consciousness about the need to help those in need. And we'll continue to work on this. But I wanted to just just just raise my give my, my, my support to this. The study session is I've learned quite a bit here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even though you sit on the city council, you're you're hit with a deluge of issues. You never know. You don't always get to dig in deep and understand and an issue as deeply as this. And so I really want to appreciate staff for their presentation and just let you all know that I'm committed to, to, to moving'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this issue as long as I'm up on this dais. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I'll be the last member speaking tonight, so be patient and I'll be very, very brief because I'd like to hear our experts in the audience speak also. I'm pretty new to this. I've just been involved since 2008.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I do recall the homeless count in January of 2009. I had the area of the greater Los Altos area, huge area, and we had one person in our homeless count. I would hazard a guess that that will not be the case this coming January.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'd also just like to thank staff and they do such a great job out there. I see Shannon in the audience and also I don't know if Alison remembers, but in 2008 I came to visit you, a private citizen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's just so ironic. You summed it all up that day. I think it was March 28, and we have so many of the same issues today, but we've made a lot of progress nonetheless.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But Councilmember Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just reminded me of something in your comments about the disinformation out there are urban legends. And I know Teresa and Shannon. I were in a meeting with some business leaders and someone took some shots at community hospital. That patient dumping just totally unsubstantiated issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh one was giving drugs that they're selling on the street, and none of that was true. But community hospital had to respond. And I thought, boy, the irony here is the 28 bed psych unit and the top of the tower, a community hospital, and I'd hate to see that ever leave.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I just start to see.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Us protect.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And save the resources we do have. Because if we lost those 28 beds, you have 72 hour, 5150 holes, you have 24 hour voluntary services there. And so I guess that's the message I'd like to leave everyone and such as preserve what we have and then try to enhance new ideas.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Also, the last point I'd like to make is that we talk about this singular entity, homeless, and as the folks in the audience, many of you know, it's far from that. It's an incredibly diverse population of individuals. And to that, I think it's going to take a diverse group of resources to address this issue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'd like to suggest that we ask all those who are compassionate on the homeless issues for help, and let's ask those who are not quite compassionate yet. And what I a line I use when in these meetings is, you know, I don't need you to be compassionate, but at least be practical, be pragmatic about this, that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the best way to address the issue is to help with the services. So that's my message for tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. I'm going back to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just to mess with you, Councilmember Juvenile, since you said you were the last, I did have one more question and I just want to thank everybody for putting together the rapid response team, the fact that we'll have the van that was included in the budget this year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that there had been some talk about that being about a 40 hour a week proactive kind of look. And I was hoping that we could come back with maybe what are the times that we get majority of our calls and trying to make sure that we have that team during those hours and possibly on the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'weekends as well, knowing that, you know, as a city, we're not providing that service on the weekends. And so just wanted to make sure that we included that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We will come back with the plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. That concludes the council questions for now on the topic. And I'm going to go and turn this over now to public comment. And just like we would normally do public comment, we'll go to line up and just as a reminder, please, guys, so we can just orderly make sure you say your name, okay, so'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that we know who you are for the record. And we will go ahead and have the timer up for you to comment. Hey, everyone, I need you. I need everyone to quiet down, please, so we can be respectful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Who is because there's a significant amount of folks. We're going to begin by doing some comments at 3 minutes and then we might have to go down to 2 minutes as we go into the into the study session.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Unless there's objection from the counsel. So we're going to begin. Please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, my name is Elizabeth Waite. I am the student rep on the homelessness task force at Long Beach City College. I'm also on the PCC Student Council representing the Senior Studies Program. As Councilman Super now pointed out, the homeless are not one large, faceless entity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a lot of diversity in the group, and I'm here to speak on behalf of one particular constituency which are homeless college students. There is an epidemic of homelessness on college campuses. There was recently an article in the L.A. Times that reported that at least one in ten CSU students is homeless.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to my knowledge, 500 students at Long Beach City College are documented as homeless. It is a very difficult problem there. I've had I have personal experience with this issue, and I cannot stress how hard it is to try and go through college and also not have a roof over your head and live out of your car'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or couch surf or live in shelters. It is it's enormously difficult. And it's hard because these are not people that look like your typical homeless person. They aren't necessarily on drugs. They don't necessarily have mental health issues. They look like integrated members of society.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as students, they do not have a place to live. And there I guarantee you probably know somebody or know somebody who knows a homeless college student.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's it's it's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An oh, we have an overwhelming need for help in this issue.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I it's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Really staggering. It's really staggering. I work with Virginia to revise and her in Ginny Baxter has people coming to them every single day with needing assistance, with rent, with housing, with books. Because the problem, the strain is so intense right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As I said, I'm the rep of student homelessness. October 9th, we're having an event where it's going to we're going to raise money for homeless students in Albuquerque. It's going to be at the Lacy campus. And I want to do everything possible to work with you guys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm new to this, you know, advocacy. I'm new to all of these. The complexity of the issue. I understand it's a very difficult issue. There's a large number of societal factors going into creating it. But I want to do everything possible to collaborate with you guys and, you know, get resources and help and do whatever I can'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to assist in this problem and speak for this constituency of people. Once again, it's obviously housing is cost effective in terms of taxes. In a most practical level, when you house people, you don't have to pay for them going to the E.R. or going and receiving other different types of services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ultimately, it's an investment because it cuts down the costs over a long period of time and the morally right thing to do. So please, please approach me. I'd love to talk to all of you and work with all of you as much as I possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Once again, my name's Elizabeth Waite, and I'm thank you for letting me speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Members. I could go on and on, but I have.'",
        "'speaker_3': '3 minutes and I think I've ever done anything in 3 minutes. So I am here specifically to talk about the need and I know that you guys have addressed it about at-risk and homeless youth. I'm glad that she brought up college students, but not everybody is in college, so I am glad that she wants to focus on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that. We're all focusing on different issues and it's great if I say anything tonight that might offend someone that's an adult homeless person. It's not meant to be. But I've had experience with people that I meet as president, Atlanta Democratic Club, and this one kid was 16 years old and was homeless from 16 to 19.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He end up getting help in L.A., where he because they have a gay and lesbian center that has at risk homeless youth services. Prior to that, he was on the street from 16 to 18, basically staying warm.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When people left Pismo Beach and the embers would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be finished and he would leave his he would sleep there. But most of you guys know this story. The sad thing is, I've seen this over and over again, you know, every time I leave my home and these kids aren't in college.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just. Know that it needs to be talked about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm not going to run it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I'm not an expert in any of this. It's just something I see all the time. And I keep water in my car and I talk to them and they get excited that there's a meeting tonight. I ran to a kid today and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Unfortunately his girlfriend.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Slit her throat while in the street because she just couldn't handle anymore. We can still save these. And again, no respect for people that are older, that are homeless. But you drive down Broadway and you'll see a kid that's hanging out with a group of people that are clearly in their disease, and we can still save them'",
        "'speaker_3': '. They need a place to go that they can be safe. They need to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Stop couch surfing, sleeping around on apps, count, you know, getting diseases. These are our kids and I would be happy to work with you in any way. Again, it's about creating dialog.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you guys gave us that opportunity tonight and that's a real warning is just the chance to speak. And thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mark. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, mayor and council members for all in the study session. My name is Dale Neal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I am the chair of the Homeless Services Advisory Commission.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Representing Councilperson or Councilwoman Pierce. I am on the Continuum of Care Board and have been employed by the Long Beach Rescue Mission for the last ten years. Additionally, I am the former director of the Winter Shelter Program under LBM and I am formerly homeless.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Please know that what I share with you here are my thoughts and does not represent the aforementioned organizations or committees. I will open with.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What you already know, how it is moving away from funding supportive services and moving towards funding just permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is rightfully so. Supportive services, in a nutshell, is all about outreach and teaching people how to live again out here with you and everyone else. Rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing and all that is good. But for many who are living with mental illness, chronically homeless, and those with addictions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Housing just isn't enough. It can sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Take months or years working with someone to build up them and their trust to get them to come in. And then we need them to stay housed. So the support services are crucial in helping this to happen. It is up to our state and local governments, along with the people, to increase and improve those supportive services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I urge you now to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Move in that direction so we can do what we've done with veteran homelessness in our great city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And announced functional zero for all who are experiencing homelessness. And I close also with.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because it was brought up a lot about the difference in the ages of homelessness. When I first went to the rescue mission a little over 11 years ago, the average age was 35 and up. And now we see a lot of 18 and 19 year olds.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It has changed dramatically.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Homelessness is not just the old men anymore.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we need to do something. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you for your work. Next, before we go to the next speaker, we have actually a lady that's at the top. She's going to speak actually next and then.'",

Those of us who faithfully pay loyally our rent well ahead of prescriptions, food, insurance, and etc. would you consider your present renters, many of whom have been residents for years, qualified to be grandfathered in?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lots of us are in our late sixties plus with no support from their families who may be far away. Others are infirm or not able to seek help or can not seek solutions on their own. Basically, I ask that you propose your elderly.'",

The prices of homes have gone up so much. Where many seniors only receive Social Security, which is most in most cases is considered poverty level.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'I really strongly urge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You to connect to people.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Do to connect our business owners and residents that are really active in the community to be part of your cheerleaders out there. You need it. It's a very complex situation and we all know that. I'm urging you to get a hold of us and do the proper things that you think we need to know so that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can spearhead that education. There is a lack of education. You brought it up with people being bussed in. That is a myth by far. You don't see pictures of it, but people talk about it. Why? Because it doesn't exist.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what we need more is for you guys to really call people like Alison Crip and myself in who are not getting a paycheck from anyone to do this. We are strictly doing this based off our passion and we want your guidance and leadership to help you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So please continue to pull us in because you need cheerleaders out there. The community thinks the city is not doing anything. It's not that you're not doing anything. It's that you need help in what you're doing. Last, I'm going to leave with this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm so passionate about this, you guys. We developed a card to hand out homeless people, correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's got three, four resources on that card. I'm a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fitness person. We have socks coming out that are called keep LPC fit and it has the resource card on it. The resource card is directly on this.

        "'speaker_11': 'First of all, homeless people is my number one passion. Well, I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing this for people that need something. Not the ones that don't want it. The ones that want it. I can't help the ones that don't want it.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The second organization is Urban Community Outreach, and we're celebrating our 10th anniversary this year. Suzi Christ mentioned us. That's Uco for short. That's who urban community outreach is and was also mentioned. There are not enough services on the weekend and that's why we are open every Sunday from 1232 for its intake day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And about 300 people come to us every Sunday because we make hot, nutritious meals that they like. Well, that's a good way to draw them in. I filled their stomach, but then we try to work with them to lift them out of the poverty and the homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_1': '75% of the people who come to us are homeless, and we have families, individuals, seniors, veterans, everyone. Well, how do we help them and how do we work with them? We interview them one on one. Those who are ready to talk to see about a way that they could rise out of their condition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Work with them, we help them set goals, and then we help them with the steps it will take to reach those goals. And most times, our goal is to be, you know, in a nice, stable condition and in a home.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'When they have a resume, they can go out and look for that job with transportation also so they can get to interviews. We help them with motel vouchers, very coveted motel vouchers. If they are working with us and trying to improve their life, we will give the families motel vouchers.'",

They will be able to see psychiatrists which will come through our partner less inaccurate clinic. They also will be with our other partner for a 90 day bridge program for addictions.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'My name is Stefan Dawson. So I am a second district resident. The problem of homelessness is actually kind of a rather simple one if you're looking at the original causes. One is a lack of affordable housing caused by speculative real estate market, especially within the downtown area, prompted by a overdevelopment of high rise, very expensive condos.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the second cause of it, of course, is that we're gonna be looking at as a statutory one. We have a lack of a form of affirmative rights for the homeless. What I mean by this is that they are presently existing within the municipal code for Long Beach, several completely on constitutional provisions that deprive homeless people of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'their First Amendment rights in terms of of criminalizing their ability to solicit donations. Their Fifth Amendment rights. The random, the random and completely unjustifiable gathering up of their belongings and the destruction thereof. And again, another first memory with their ability to sleep within certain certain areas.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All of these are presently within the invisible code and are enforced on a daily basis in a discriminatory manner against the homeless. This is not a idle problem.

        "'speaker_11': 'well aware of, but again, is not being properly supported. This will cause people this will cause Long Beach to be a less diverse place, both racially and in terms of our economic ability and will lead to more deaths.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What I mean by that is ask our fire department about how many converted houses and that they're finding out now who they're discovering on a daily basis. How many people, as our friends discussed earlier, are living in nine or ten people within a studio apartment or in a back house?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is not habitable conditions, and this can be fixed by affirmative legislation, by this by the council. They can never get to.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Committed their efforts towards addressing this issue with their public safety and certainly the quality of life. This is the the elephant in the room that people don't like to talk about. And the face of homelessness does not have an age, does not have a race, does not have a gender.'",

Second, I want to tell you that the people we come in contact that we have problems with in the first District that affect us are the'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have these people that are mentally ill, are unapproachable, some of them are violent, and some of them, you know, we cannot go up to them and try to help them. Also, I'd like to know how many quality of life officers you have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For our our city, because I have been in a situation where I had called and they told me at the police department that until they.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Finished taking care of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All the emergencies, they couldn't come down. And so we waited 20 minutes and no one ever showed up. So I'm wondering if those quality of life officers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have been increased for our area or for the city? As a matter of fact. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. What we'll do is I know we'll make sure we get you the information. And some of that was I know we went over it in the presentation, but there's a lot more that we can get you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll make sure we connect you with the exact plan, particularly for Linkin Park and around that. So maybe Councilman Gonzales can send that over.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And we'll have Corey connect with you. We're working on a meeting actually with Geo, our neighbor here. So we'll connect you with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next week or please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Gary Sheldon's my name is one block north of where I'm standing right now. And so it's a pleasure to greet you all this evening and a little bit of my own creds. People have been giving their credit this evening.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I served for two terms as the chairman of the Homeless Services Advisory Commission back in my day, and I also sat with my sister, Janet Rhodes, as we tried to figure out how to phrase and how to how to put together.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The drop in center at First Congregational Church has been mentioned several times. She was the founder of it. She lives in Atlanta, Georgia, right now. Janet Rhoads The two years that I spend on Homeless Services Advisory Commission were like beating my head against the wall of the dais here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Frankly, we had a completely different council back then. We had a different mayor. We had a mayor at one time who would walk out of the room whenever homelessness was being discussed back behind the rail there. I want to praise Mayor Garcia once more in public, like I've done any number of times.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You're the first Mayor, Robert, in memory who has even mentioned poverty or homelessness in all of your speeches, your inaugural speech, your wonder days, your one year, year to year. We really, really support you on that. And I believe that that's why we're here right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wanted to direct thank you. I wanted to direct your attention to two things that the council has in its purview that it can fix is get their development services people to actually comply with SB two, which is the by right placement of homeless shelters, which right now does not comply with the state law.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The same thing with the placement of SRO housing, which for the first time in anybody's memory, we have an ordinance for SRO housing and I just want to leave it. The reason they don't comply is there's no available as our OSE or or SB two sightings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They're not adequate and they're not accessible. So those are the things that you can do. And I want to say that you have us, the members of the public, we have your back on this thing, forge forward with it, and you've got the power to make it happen.'",

I'm mostly representing myself tonight as an architect. I'd be glad to donate some of my architectural services and get together with some other architects.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Long Beach has a lot of really fine architectural firms, and architects are expensive, and I donate some time to work with the homeless center if they come up with projects where they can improve existing buildings. Because most of my work is improving existing buildings or industry, but I work on a lot of housing projects as well, and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'd be glad to donate some of my time to help them and find some other architects that we could work together and possibly get some contractors and some developers to kick in some free services too, because all this cost a lot of money and I want to give back to my community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I grew up in Long Beach, so I'd love to help out homeless people. I was lucky enough to grow up in Eldorado Park Estates, which is one of the gems of the city. And now I work in the West Side, which is the money driver, the city, and has some serious homeless problems.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The problems we have in the West Side are mostly the mentally ill and the drug abuse and homeless people. And it's a very serious problem for the industrial businesses because at night we leave most, most of the business.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So those aren't 24 hours. And in our neighborhoods, we have a serious problem with RV's that have people in living in them that are mentally ill. And we and they know the laws very well and they they park for three days and then they move.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they've been creating serious problems for businesses there. And we need some real help with these people because they don't really want to help. They want to just be left alone. But they are causing a lot of serious problems.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've we've sent letters, Darlene, and I'm sure she'll share all that information with you. And I think they're the hardest part of the homeless problem is the people that have mental illnesses and drug and alcohol problems, because a lot of them don't want help or they don't know how to get it or how to use it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's just like every other population in our whole society, 95% of us are great people and there's 5% that caused the problem that make a lot of people hate that whole group. And it's really sad because most homeless people aren't there by choice, but they're there by some really bad circumstances and we need to help them'",

Consider the extensive efforts of activate uptown development of areas like the pike and beautification of downtown infrastructure.'",

These projects imply that money is being spent installing murals onto walls, then installing people's and people into homes.

        "'speaker_4': 'The systemic issues that cause displacement exist in the policy world. Renters rights, inclusionary zoning, lawful eviction and a number of affordable housing units that accurately reflects the number of people in need. These are basic protections. Right now, gentrification is eating away at their ability to live in Long Beach without living in fear.'",

I've learned a lot centuries of the nonprofit manager, developer and steward of the villages that Cabrillo, together with a number of other wonderful organizations out in West Long Beach. We've been a long time partner of the city in addressing the needs of our homeless.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Clearly, the needs are great. The issue of homelessness has become more visible and has really captured the public's attention, and rightfully so. Many of us in this room have been working on this issue for many, many years. And as has as has been shared tonight, the city has achieved a number of really remarkable successes over the years'",
        "'speaker_11': ', to name just a few, a reduction of unsheltered homelessness between the last two homeless counts, achieving UFA status for a continuum of care, being on the cusp of ending veteran homelessness, new permanent supportive housing developments like Anchor Place and others to name just a few.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those successes don't happen on their own. They require leadership, diligence and compassion on the part of city staff, elected officials and the community. I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of conditions which I think have contributed to the successes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'First, this commitment tonight session is a really great testimony to local commitment, both within the public and private sector to addressing the needs of our homeless. We also benefit from strong citizen leadership on boards like the Homeless Services Advisory Committee and the Continuum of Care Coordination.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have a highly coordinated system with our own health department, a dedicated multi-service center control. We also have a dedicated continuum of care funding. Unlike LaSalle, which services 85 different cities throughout Southern California, we have our own continuum of care, funding and concentration.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The city has really dedicated resources in a number of key ways that have led to economies of scale and strong linkages. I encourage everyone to please think about this issue as as really being as homeless, as being a symptom and not being the direct problem.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The problem is a deeper human problem. And to solve that problem, we really need to think about investing in the support of services needing to it needed to address the symptom. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. My name is Vincent to Mia. Thank you, Mayor, for hosting this. Amazing Pandora's box that you've opened. Briefly just to state in a sentence why I appreciate what you do. My father was an assistant city clerk for 30 years in Columbus, Ohio.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'On the back. I'm trying to tell you that I have a wealth of information and I'm begging.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You to provide. Make a provision.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'For more of what you're hearing here tonight. What's missing for me are resources. I said for years. For decades. We need a multi-service center. Thank God we have one. How long did that take? You know, and our our police are so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Understaffed with what I have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Experienced with the police department, is what I was told by an officer who I won't.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'I understand we're working on a bare bones, but the quality of life does not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just apply to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Homeless people. It applies.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To the residents who live here and the businesses who are operating here, who are being affected.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'By the homelessness. I feel sorry for developers, but I also feel sorry for residents.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because the city is not holding landlords, slumlords and property management companies to accountability.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How many years has this city council been told.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That there are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Substandard conditions in living?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You want to talk about prevention? Kelly I applaud your report. Teresa, I welcome you long awaited. But seriously, we need resources.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because we don't have them. We don't have because we don't have an actual building. The the MHRA wanted a building.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Over off of Anaheim. I think it was this multistory unit that they had and then it was taken away from them. It belongs to a family in Texas. It's sitting there empty.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I hear we need resources.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So here's my few solutions for you right now. We've got to make it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've got to make rent control.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, give.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You just five.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Quickly, though. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How about some public restrooms? Nobody's mentioned it. How about some case? Watch a community case. Watch where we can all log into a central.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Location and talk about here is this homeless person that we've been dealing with for five, ten, 20 years. We already know their story. We already helped them. This is why nothing's happening with them. You have it in case watch in social services.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Why don't you have it at a community level?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And lastly, I would just say.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Please, for God's sakes, would you make a mandate for locking dumpsters and recycle bins?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Please. Especially in the downtown core businesses, it should be mandated.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That locking dumpsters and locking recycle bins, those recycle bins, it's a misdemeanor if you steal out of them. Yet we're enabling our homeless people by providing them a place where they can come and get recyclables and cash it in for alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, come on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker. And just as I'm going to have to I know I've been a little I'm trying to be flexible with the time. But again, we have still probably an hour of public comment. And so I want to make sure that just the 2 minutes we'll try to keep the flow as best possible.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we build housing statewide. We've built 7500 units over our 32 year existence, and we also build permanent supportive housing. What that means is we build housing for the homeless with permanent wraparound services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we talk about solutions to this problem, long term solutions that can be multiplied over years. That's what we're talking about. And as we've heard through personal stories and through statistics tonight, this is a tremendous challenge.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'that you're addressing this issue creates a lot of hope in me having been involved in these kinds of discussions for the better part of two decades.

        "'speaker_11': 'And Councilmember Pierce, you were asking, you know, what what about wraparound for other sorts of housing as well? You know, there are some funds available. The County of Los Angeles funds my program to provide services to people with severe and persistent mental illnesses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We cannot find enough housing for them, but we would be happy to provide the wraparound services for the folks living in those in those housing units kind of thing. So if you can create the housing, we can provide the services at least to some parts of that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember Price, you also asked about the lack of substance use services. There is absolutely a dearth of those services. And but the good news is on the horizon is that CMS has given California a waiver to increase Medi-Cal drug services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so effective probably July 1st of next year, there will be many more services for substance use disorders available to the low income population. My own agency will be providing those services. I know nine months is a long time to wait, but there is help on the horizon with that.'",

As I mentioned earlier, I volunteer for the drop in center downtown at Uco and I've actually lived in Long Beach since 2008 and have seen the homeless situation through many of its ups and downs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have been volunteering for over a year and have made it my personal mission to develop countless community partners and involve city council in the mix from the start. And in doing this, my focus was always on the good things my organization was doing and others like it to deal with the homeless problem in our city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This involves not just feeding the homeless, but providing services to get them off the streets and on to a more productive life. Talking about city council. I personally want to thank both Ginny Pierce, who the minute I mentioned the situation about the homeless to her, she had organized a day of service for the homeless immediately.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Lack of compassion I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Felt for the homeless. No one chooses to be homeless, and these are good people who deserve our compassion. Long Beach is a compassionate city that cares about its own. Proven by the fact that we are already, I believe, right in the midst of Long Beach serves right now and with Long Beach serves.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'I have to wrap it up. So it's okay. It's okay. Oh, I just I just want just one last thing. It's just that, you know, I think many volunteer based organizations are really trying to be involved in the solution.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'out of the apartment at 1230 on a Saturday night. And there's just a couple of points I really wanted to make tonight is if I knew a lot about homeless services, was embarrassed and ashamed to seek out the help that I needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It took me three days to get over the shock and realize that I was homeless. How is it for a people that have mental issues and drug issues? How can we help to help to house them? And I ran a program at Second Samoan Congregational Church where we fed and provided services to the homeless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The homeless create their own community because we are ostracized. This you don't know what it's like to be homeless until you have to bathe in a sink and. I can't couldn't talk and tell my friends this because I was afraid of their reaction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was lucky I had people that allowed me to couch surf in their homes and places where I could stay that were safe. So we need to preserve those communities. And when we look at doing providing services for them, that's what I see is the big gap, because they're living outside of the norms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They still have to have support and they lean on each other. And I don't know. And I had to call a person's father and tell him that he had OD'd and something I never, ever want to see anybody have to do.'",

There are new emerging needs and issues and diverse challenges that are facing our homeless population today that is different than in the past. And so we really appreciate the opportunity for us to have these important dialogs and to ask how do we have a thriving city as well'",

And we feel honored and we're committed to working together with everyone to really come up with these solutions and try to prevent and make sure that we have less homeless individuals and families on the streets in our city'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I have a friend that has been homeless since January. The reason for her being homeless is not because of the fact that she and her husband can't pay rent. They lived in their apartment for 39 years before being evicted.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They were evicted because a new owner bought the place and needed to be redone and the city code would not allow them to stay there. And the part meant that they had. They've been living in a motel ever since because she is in a wheelchair and they haven't been able to find any place that is suitable for'",
        "'speaker_11': 'them to live because there are no accessible housing units to be had in the city, not at any price unless you can pay over $5,000 a month. They were paying approximately 2000 or less, less than 2000 a month for their place.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But now they're having to stay in a motel where they have no kitchen, one bed and not very comfortable. And that's by the time they pay their motel. Food, eating out and all the rest of it that is costing them almost $10,000 a month.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is ridiculous. We do not have proper, accessible housing and necessary and they are homeless even though they are in a motel. They are still homeless.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'predators, thieves, drug users. One for the whole city. I think the city you know, city people here, the councilman and the mayor owe it to the people that pay the taxes, bring the money into the city, that help pay for these programs to protect their homes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't think Janine or Suzy want people defecating in their yard. And I'm sure if it was happening in their front yard and their stuff was being stolen, they would have police all over the place. Mr. Super and I live in his neighborhood and it hasn't really been a big issue for him either.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But crime has gone up astronomically in our neighborhood. We have a ride away between the freeway and Knoxville Avenue where the homeless are living, and they're coming out every night. My wife goes out at 430 in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She's afraid to walk to her car in this neighborhood because she's caught numerous people lurking in the cars coming out of bushes. I think we owe it to the whole community, the entire community to protect everybody, including the homeless and everybody else.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'It's something you want you hope you can get. I would like the city council to do this now, if one of the ways we talked about getting rid of homelessness or reducing homelessness was a wonderful plan that Kelley proposed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But one of the things I heard in her presentation was that there were no resources that she was stuck because they weren't resources and she couldn't carry out plans. She couldn't continue to do things to reduce homelessness. So where where is this resource?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Where can we get these resources? Well, one thing she mentioned was that it'd be volunteers. Well, I did volunteer work. I got with the drop in center and we did that. We, we, we we're a rich country. We should be able to solve this problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Utah was able to solve and have zero homelessness. Why can't we? We should think outside the box. There's a proposition, J.J. in Los Angeles, which will require that whenever a department wants to make a zoning change, that they have to set aside a certain percentage, percentage of their housing to be affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, that's one way of doing it. You can't just do it in terms of volunteers. You have to have some oomph and some push behind it. The also, I would say that we should try and increase the penalties for false evictions and that would help with homelessness so they can get again, I urge you, adopt zero homelessness'",

        "'speaker_9': 'As you phase it in kind of thing. Okay. But the question that I had is, is there a way to ward the ordinance or right now it says as posted, can we remove the terminology as posted and just prohibit the parking without parking without a posting requirement?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Because the reason I asked that is because the memo from March indicated something, and I think I have it highlighted here. It says it says in discussions with the city attorney's office, there is concern that the current BMC requires that parking restrictions can only be enforced if signs stating the specific restrictions are posted.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's really no way to modify that. It would be any ordinance we'd have to have signage.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. I'm going to second to move this along, but I have a different approach to this. And I signed on with Councilwoman Pryce originally. My interest is the commercial corridors, and that's what we've received complaints on, not the residential areas.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So how we've handled that so.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Far, because as as Councilwoman Pryce mentioned, we started this a long time ago, a year ago. And so we've been placing individual signage at these kind of dangerous corridors. One is examining where it curves between Atherton and LASCARIS diagonal, where it was blocking the view.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The the RVs are blocking the view of people coming out of the shopping center just because it's taken so long. We've expanded that to other streets and we're continuing to do that. We have requests in that's working for us, but it looks like we we could use, you know, something that's more comprehensive.'",

I just realized that no one diligently, not everyone diligently reads my newsletter every Friday, which we've talked about this issue, but not everyone got the message.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'zone we will require. It would be the Coastal Commission would probably require a coastal development permit to do that. So there's a lot of other questions that this brings up that I don't think we've had properly reviewed as yet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's not within this this request here. So I would I would move that we probably move that that we receive and file this for the present time because of the uncertainties that it has, impacts on terms of the coastal areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're not separating that out. And I don't think that we can at this at this point. And so I don't I don't I don't see where we have the feasibility of providing an ordinance that would address all the other issues that affect Long Beach as a whole, being a beach city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I understand that we could look at other. Neighboring cities and what they've done. However, they're not on the coast. We are. There is experiences also that I've had in the Coastal Commission that we've we've looked at these types of ordinances being put and they've all been rejected because of the fact that any, any changes would made for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'RV parking and other types of parking along the coast. It would limit access. And we're talking about access to the beach, not just to the parking lots and other areas along our coast. So it's incomplete. I'm not very I'm not very clear as to what we need to do with it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would move that we receive a file.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, Counselor Rosetta is that I am making a substitution. Okay. I think that if you're going to do that, you have to process the stop or. Okay. Is there a second on that? Okay. That's the second on that camera.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go down the speakers speakers list. We have Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Yeah. I feel like I have a lot of questions about this, both in regards to the coastal zone, but also especially on a day when we just had hours of testimony around homelessness. And we have 70% of our homeless people in L.A. County sleep outdoors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there's a DOJ ruling, several DOJ rulings that says that unless we have adequate beds for our housing, for our homeless, that we cannot make it illegal for them to sleep in their cars or to do camping. And so I would have some questions for the city attorney about, you know, Jones versus L.A., Joyce versus the city'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and county of San Francisco and a number of other rulings that would put us at risk and ask the question if we would be at risk for a lawsuit if we did something like this when we didn't have adequate housing yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think you raise a very good point and a very true concern that our office will have in drafting an ordinance regarding the RVs. And you have to truly separate the issue of homelessness and RV parking restrictions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You are correct that certain cities have had their RV ordinances overturned if they're used as a pretext to either punish or try and eliminate homeless. So so you're absolutely correct. The point that Councilmember Price made, though, is a valid point on line of sight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Other issues where you have oversize vehicles that create those type of issues, I think you can properly regulate, but you cannot use this ordinance. And as some of the comments that came in electronically on this ordinance were alluding to is they see it as a remedy to cure the homeless issue or folks that are living in their'",
        "'speaker_6': 'cars. So, yes, that is a concern that we would have to look at, as is the concern of the councilmember from the seventh District of the coastal zone. Um, we could certainly maybe come back with a report before an ordinance or a receiving file.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can we could work on something and bring something else back at a later date. But those are two very important issues that we would be looking at in crafting an ordinance that we believe would be enforceable for regulation of RV parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I mean, I think I would say, you know, if we received and filed this and came back with something that know was very clearly had protections for our coastline, that ensured that, you know, our homeless population was not going to be at risk, you know, that that I'd be open to a future conversation on that'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, is there a specific.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a great question. And I would have to work with traffic engineers to talk about commercial corridors and how we would try and define that in an ordinance. So to be determined.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. That would be great because I would hope that it would mean everything. But who knows? It's a tough one, but okay, perfect. So we'll hopefully come back with that information. And then as far as signage, I think signage is important in this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know it would be very costly, but perhaps we can phase it in starting with certain hotspot areas that are more liable to receive the RV oversize issue. That's just a thought. And then as far as differences in businesses and then residents, we have different perspectives because businesses I know there are some areas where in the Westside'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Industrial area where there's a need for oversize parking on the street. And so we've had issues where we've cited some of these business owners, but yet they are you know, they're parking there at 2 a.m. and they need to park their you know, they're parking there for, you know, a little a short time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they're, you know, they're employee parking. And although that area doesn't have any residences, maybe there's some sort of, uh, I don't know what we're able to do and if we've done anything that has a perfect balance because that's an issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know we're going to hear it on the West Side. Definitely. I'd also like to see if it is possible in our language because. In this is as to whether we can include something that states that these vehicles cannot block places of business because it doesn't state that specifically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that is a huge hindrance, whether you're oversize. RV Whatever the case, I think blocking a business and I think I've heard from our business owners quite often that it's just it's really an impact to them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't know. Can we include that language in here?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Charlie Vice Mayor Councilmember Gonzalez Currently we're talking to the motion of the seventh District to receive and file. If we get back to the original motion, I think there's a lot of different options that we can talk about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And depending on the direction of the council, we can research in and look at what our options would be for the council to consider an ordinance if they desire.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, great. So yeah, I was talking to the original motion, but yes, I think I would be supportive of the original motion because I agree. I think the two issues need to be separated. I think we'll have a larger discussion in November.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're going to have a more comprehensive homeless report coming out. And I think at that time we can discuss issues related to RV. Are these people sleeping in cars, which I think is a huge issue. We talked about it at length today, but is when it comes to RV, it's an issue regardless whether it's east side, west'",
        "'speaker_4': 'side, north. I think it needs to be handled and we haven't really figured that out yet. So I would be supportive of doing a substitute substitute motion that would revert back to the original motion. Basically, everything Councilwoman Price entailed in here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I would like, as I mentioned, clarification on commercial corridors, possibly an idea on phasing in signage, whether we can block places of business or we can include not to block places of business in finding some sort of balance between business and residential.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Preferences. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, could you, uh. Do you mind plugging in your. But. It's not going up on my screen for whatever reason, but. I'm not getting anything. Did you really did you really push it? Okay. It just went up, actually, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. We have a we have a substitute. Substitute and a second and essentially is to take councilman precious motion, but then to add what Councilman Gonzales talked about as part of the discussion. Correct. Okay. Thank you. So let me just go down, Constable Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So I do have a few questions for clarity, because now we're speaking to the substitute substitute motion. The I understand the intent is to to address concerns and traffic safety in our residential communities and on our commercial corridors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct? Yes. Okay. And. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For me, it's councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm Tony.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Gonzales, the substitute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gonzalez and Councilmember Price. Yes. And then the. The. The enforcement of the ordinance. Is that purely predicated on there being signage?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. In order to enforce any type of ordinance like this, the vehicle code and our municipal code require proper notification to the residents or the owners of the RV.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so Councilmember Price threw a couple of numbers out. And I guess that was based on a too far from the signage being from 100000 to $1000000. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. City staff put together just a order of magnitude cost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We haven't done a tremendous amount of analysis, but we estimated if we were to sign the entrance ways and again, we'd have to define those entrance ways of about approximately $100,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you're looking at actually.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Signing streets and we would do that fairly liberally under the million dollars, we'd be actually looking at $1,000,000 that could actually be higher than that. But of course, we're going to try to keep the costs down if for whatever option the council chooses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So our actions tonight and giving you direction to potentially draft an ordinance, would that be committing us to up to $100 million? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, no. I mean, tonight, if there was direction then then as soon as we were completed with the ordinance, we would bring that back to the council with a staff report. And I envision working with the city manager's office and public works for what that ordinance would look like and then also what that audience would cost as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'far as notification and enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, thank you for that clarification. That makes me feel a little bit better about moving forward with this. I do think this is an issue that has come up in numerous community meetings in my district, mostly on the residential front.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think if. If I could, um. And that, you know, it's not just recreational vehicles. And I don't know how we're defining recreational vehicles, but oftentimes they are large boats or oversize other vehicles. And I think it's very important that if the intent is mostly traffic safety and removing nuisances from from neighborhoods and commercial corridors, that we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be inclusive with that language and making sure that it's a little bit broader. That's just my recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember. I believe that the motion does include restricting oversize and recreational vehicles. If I may have just been saying recreational vehicles, but I believe that the direction is to include both oversize and recreational vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that would include boats, large boats. Is that a recreational vehicle?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would likely fall in the category of oversize depending on the size of the boat.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. And then I personally had an experience recently where, you know, I used my my in-laws RV and parked it in front of my house. And it was over the weekend that we we used it and we're working family.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh, I had to return it all the way back to the Inland Empire. And so it took a few days for me to, to actually get the muster up to, to, to brave the freeway with this large RV.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, I can imagine if that is the case for a lot of folks, particularly families who are vacationing and using recreational vehicles and to meet a 48 hour restriction is very, very restrictive. Right. And so I would like to offer a friendly amendment to extend that that time, because not everybody in that recreational vehicle is is homeless'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or there to be a burden on their neighbor. Um, you know, sometimes people have vacations and people have to go back to work and uh, I like to see that that extended at least, you know, four or five days so that the families can, can have the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And oftentimes you have families visiting, visiting your home, and it's oftentimes difficult for them to find a place to park an RV. I remember many years ago, the the parking lot at McDonnell Douglas in Bowie was full of ARVs from employees, from whomever else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was a place where it was a safe place for for folks to park their RVs. It was free. It was a, um, and it served a purpose. I don't know that we have those options available as abundant as they were.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I just think we need to be I understand the intent here and I support the intent. I just would like to be a little bit more flexible with the with the time. And so I'd like to just offer a friendly amendment to extend that to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Days. Like four days. That's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a. I'm assuming, Mr. Attorney, that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What counselor we would need is a decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I know, but that's fine. Okay. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I would also just ask that because, again, businesses are different from residences that we look at that because four or five days in front of a bit different than four or five.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I'm speaking specifically to reservations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Okay. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so for residents, I think it should be extended a little bit longer. I'm just understanding that. They're real challenges.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have customer supernova.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I think Councilor Austin Austin just covered it for me. And that is, you know, most of this is a complaint driven to our offices, and my complaints have been on those commercial corridors. And that should include we wanted a definition of that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It has to include surface streets. That is, that run parallel to a commercial corridor that seems to be a favorite parking spot. It's not in front of anybody's house. It might be at the side of someone's house, but those load up quickly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And also, I would really like to hear public testimony, first of all, because I've sat here for so long, I appreciate that this isn't a typical council night, but I think Councilman Rawson is in the right neighborhood of of days versus hours.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And but I'm sure our public testimony will zero in on that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it just gets back back to that concept of Can I.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Park my RV in front of my own house because I don't want to unload it after driving several hundred miles home, I want a few days to recoup. So I think that's very reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Mr. Mayor, if I can point something out for the council's liberation from the signage plan, if it's a standardize for most of the corridors, that is when we can do it at the entrances. If we if the council chooses to go in a direction where it's more restrictive on certain corridors and less restrictive on others, that's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'where signage becomes more of a bike corridor, or we have to have more, more signage. So just something to bear in mind as the council considers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. With that Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Just a few quick points. The first is in regards to Councilman Aranguiz concerns, I think they're very valid concerns, especially coming from him, from the Coastal Commission. And again, I do want to highlight that this is an issue that I have conveyed to my colleagues for over a year now that's very important to me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I've really tried to do my best to communicate so that we can have the time to have a dialog. On March 15th, Council's TFF actually highlighted several I'm sorry, the city staff to have several ordinances and in there they wrote that specifically what Councilman Urunga is talking about in regards to the Coastal Commission, stating that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We would have to get approval from the Coastal Commission if any of the areas are going to involve a coastal zone, which I thought was very, very good to point out that that wouldn't prohibit us from moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In fact, the same TFF talks about SEAL Beach that has a they prohibit parking within the city and Huntington Beach also has a city wide prohibition. Newport Beach has a city wide prohibition. A city of Santa monica has a citywide prohibition, which wasn't in the staff report, but some information that we research later.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's just something for us to to think about, is that certainly we would go through the steps. But there is some precedent for this because there is a public health concern as well as a traffic safety concern with with these vehicles because of their size, which sets them apart from others.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In regards to Councilwoman Pierce's comments. Again, really great comments, points that we have considered. And the first question I would ask is, Councilwoman Pierce, you mentioned that there were some inconsistencies with our item in the staff report. I'd be curious to know what those inconsistencies are, because we did a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Really, really.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We tried to be very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thorough.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And go with the staff's recommendation. The TFF from March 15th has the recommendations from staff saying staff recommends a more focused approach and believes it is necessary to change elements of the Long Beach Municipal Code to provide more clarity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Further, any modifications should provide consistency throughout the city and minimize the cost of enforcement. Specific changes to the Long Beach Municipal Code should include a prohibition against parking oversize vehicles within the city right of way and in front of residential properties.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That was one of the suggestions and exceptions can be made for loading and unloading of oversize vehicles. So we try to stick with the staff's recommendation in our agenda item. So if there are inconsistencies, I'd love to have those pointed out because we definitely tried to not have that and that must have been inadvertent on our part'",
        "'speaker_9': '. This is very separate than the homeless issue. In fact, you know, we have there are several facilities, several areas in the city of Long Beach where people can actually park ARVs. They're permitted to do so. The Walmart location is one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We also have the multi-service center and we've talked with our our folks over and homeless services about the possibility of eventually moving towards a scenario where folks could park oversize vehicles in the parking lot area there and allow them to get some services, maybe health care services and things as a way to offer more resources to folks'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that may not have a place to live other than their car. So this item is really, truly about public health in terms of just waste disposals and things on public streets and in areas that are not designed for that and the blockage of corridors for traffic safety reasons, that's the complaints that we've received.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's really that we brought this item forward. Like I said way before, we were having discussions about homelessness. The TFF is from March of 2016, but the item was brought forth by my office about six months before that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it really the motivation for this item had nothing to do with tonight's meeting or discussions that we've heard of late. There really are complaint based residential concerns that we've heard and we're trying to respond to. Having said that, if if this is an important issue and it's important for all of the communities and all the districts'",
        "'speaker_9': ', I would ask because it's an important issue and because I've I really have tried to give courtesy to my colleagues and get feedback and input and allow a lot of time for discussion and individual communities that we not receive and file.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that really is is a way to, you know, to try to kill this idea that's important to at least a couple of us. So if if there's a need for additional reports that folks have, then maybe we can approach it that way and report back on something specific.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think to receive and file, you know, I just would say on a personal and professional level, I don't really see what the need for that is if in fact, it's important to one of our. Colleagues and we have allowed ample time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If someone doesn't like the ordinance, certainly they can vote against it. But to receive and file it is to kill a discussion that was started a long time ago with ample opportunity for involvement by everyone. So I'd ask you guys to really think about that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So thank you for your courtesy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank Councilmember Price and Supernova for bringing this forward and the city council for their comments. And I think everyone is speaking the complete truth that is there. If it is their truth in their council district and is their reality that they're dealing with the nuisances, and we should acknowledge that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and respect that. After all, that's why we have council districts with different perspectives and points of view so that we can be responsive to our community. So I'm entirely supportive of this this discussion. I do have my concerns as the ninth District Council member and with and, you know, a little bit of experience here on dealing with'",
        "'speaker_10': 'issues where our laws aren't flexible enough to address issues in our in our community, and it doesn't lend itself to creativity. I think Councilwoman Pearce said it best with the conversation we had earlier on homelessness. I think we have to really be clear and focused on what the intent is, what we want to address, because what I'",
        "'speaker_10': 'heard earlier from Councilwoman Price was about health and safety and and that I completely agree with 100%. There's no no need for the elimination or dumping of raw sewage into into, you know, gutters and things like that. I completely understand we've dealt with issues like that in my council district, and 100%, I would say the entire council'",
        "'speaker_10': 'would be unequivocally clear that we support we wouldn't support that activity. But at the same time, I think that's distinctly different from the individual who owns an RV and has worked it out with their neighbors. And, you know, I have an example.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was sent a text message tonight from someone, a neighborhood leader who lived in their neighborhood 20, 30 years. And they worked it out with their neighbors. And their good neighbors are actually officers in the neighborhood association. And and it's the reason that they don't they don't go to storage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not that they're you know, they're poor. They can't afford storage for the RV, but they've taken the time to build that rapport and they don't want to pay the, you know, whatever it might be, between 100, 200 bucks a month for storage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we need to be able to have flexibility in cases like that. But in our neighborhoods now, I think we need to understand what the difference is between those two so that we can build public policy around it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've gotten caught up before on this council with the concept of Not in my backyard, and that's becoming and I'm afraid that's becoming the nemesis of good public policy or compromise. So local solution, in my opinion, it needs to we need to establish some criteria for what that is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it might take some time, but establish some criteria for what what what would determine a neighborhood that qualifies to to go no RV in the flexibility given to the traffic engineer to work with those local neighborhoods and business corridors to find solutions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've we had an example like this. We are preferential parking districts. Our ordinance is very stringent. It has criteria and it takes a long time to put in place. And that was problematic given we had a temporary problem.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'El Camino College, Compton Center, which is in our city, had to open up its gates and created a parking impact on a neighborhood that typically wasn't parking impacted. So we changed our ordinance so that we could be more responsive quicker, gave the ability for the traffic engineer to go around the petition process and and make the call'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that this area is indeed impacted by these problems. And they put forth a 18 month process to meet that neighborhood's needs. And when construction was over, it worked and everyone's happy. Many people in the city may not know about this because we handled it locally and we address in our neighborhood locally.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know that this and we just should be very clear that this is not this is this is going to be we had a lot of testimony. This was this has been the kind of policy that takes cities sometimes years or even a decade to implement, because there are people on all sides of this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And let's not you know, I don't think there should be a receiving file, but I also don't think that we should move forward with direction to do a citywide ordinance. There has to be something in the middle that says, you know, we take our time, get it right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, we we try to avoid being divisive. We try to bring people together around what the real issues are, is based on health and safety. We should be able to define, you know, what are the parameters or criteria to define who actually has a registered RV that lives here and who is, you know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Renting out their RV to homeless folks or who's living in the RV, and we address it through services or whatever that is. So. So I just want to make sure we have an opportunity to be creative. I don't think we should rush to, you know, number one, it's going to be either motion that's on the table right'",
        "'speaker_10': 'now filled up in the first three speakers motions. So there was really no opportunity to be creative or put something together tonight. And that's the very reason why if I had to, I would probably vote against all the motions tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What I would rather do is ask that we we, you know, ask the maker of the substitute substitute motion that we work with staff, give them some flex flexibility based on either this temporary fresh rental parking district or other things that look like to look at establishing criteria and establishing a pilot that we can actually look at'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in a city, in an area town, this that's impacted. And we look at that and, you know, what goes in that into that pilot, that local council member can help create that pilot and should it work. Then we explore going citywide because we're larger than every city listed in the report.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And and those cities took a long time to get it implemented. And they're literally a fifth of our size. And I know there are other cities that have gotten done that are bigger, but I'm just let's not let's not forget how large of a city we are and everything doesn't have to be a up or down vote'",
        "'speaker_10': '. So so I guess because there's no way to do anything else, I'm just going to offer a friendly to the maker of the substitute substitute motion that they give staff the flexibility to look at a pilot and establish some criteria based on some of the things that we heard tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the business corridors and things like that and report back on how they would approach that, that pilot. I think that would probably be something that I and most of the council could see in nodding heads. A lot of people can can support tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's my that's my friendly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd like the pilot in CD3.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this would be a I mean I'm all for that, I guess if everybody's, you know, on board, but I guess are we seeing a citywide pilot? So each council district is not promoting their I guess I.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I wouldn't say a citywide pilot. I think we like, you know, we when we piloted the Alcohol Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, we piloted an amount of space that our planning folks that we can manage, we can manage this in this area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they ended up being the 9 to 5 zip code or the planning district in North Long Beach. I think we just got to leave some flexibility to staff to say, what can we do and do well and study and see, should this expand?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Almost every time we do a pilot in Long Beach, it ends up getting expanded because our staff does great. Whenever we start citywide, we end up with chickens, goats and bees. We end up with, you know, things on the ballot that we could, you know, just just saying we should take our time and look at it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But perhaps the pilot can give some flexibility to staff. The things you guys brought up are not they're not unheard of. Like to protect your business teacher who who doesn't want to do that, protect feces and things like that going into the you know, on the street.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of course we wanna support that. But there but you have to agree there are very legitimate neighborhoods or people who own an RV and have worked it out with their neighbors and would really be offended if we didn't take our time and and do this the right way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this is in the interest of finding a compromise that meets the needs, gives the tools to the local council members and the traffic engineer to make those determinations and doesn't break our budget. That's all I'm looking for tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I think. I mean, it should be fine, I think. I don't know if it's possible to, because I would like to see what an ordinance would look like. I don't know if it's okay to have something simultaneously.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, it would still have to go to two readings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I understand the council person from the ninth district. I think the friendly would be to change your motion to make this a pilot program in district number x, whatever district ion CD3 volunteered, but whatever district you would want, I think we would come back with something.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, I am to talk to the traffic engineer in public works, but some sort of a draft ordinance that would be a pilot program only adopted in that district for some period of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, if we want to adopt them in the districts that I think are most I mean, such a friendly environment, I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think well, I don't want to speak for the councilmember, but it would be very difficult if we're going to do pilot programs in eight different areas or nine different areas of the city. That would be unmanageable. I'm sorry, I.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Wouldn't be a pilot to do them. A bunch of them. It wouldn't be a pilot that's essentially hashing out tonight, which is what we're trying to get away from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm just trying to understand what how what are your.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would recommend allowing whoever is going to working on the city site work with maybe the council members who who who brought it up and explore and look at one. One area that could be a pilot. We learn from it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If these things if there are certain things we can glean, like taking commercial corridors out citywide, then great. That's what comes out of this. If it having the tools to go, you know, look at neighborhoods that have certain criteria like homelessness issues and things like that, then those are the things we can learn from this pilot.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But what we want to get away from tonight is determining citywide or which neighborhood, and we want to give some some flexibility to staff to work on somewhere that they think can be successful. Is that even possible, Mister City Manager or Mister City Attorney?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is that feasible? What I'm asking. I didn't run it by any of you. I just didn't want to have a fourth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We were just talking about that. You didn't run it by us. We're needing some direction here because our our dilemma is if we were directed to come back on an ordinance and you scale it back in size, we wouldn't be able to give you any kind of scope on the cost of enforcement because we have no idea'",
        "'speaker_6': 'what what the size of your pilot program would be if you give us direction that you would like to do a pilot program in and I'm making this up in CD3 and you tell us to work with a council person to determine the size.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then we would come back with it with a draft pilot program or an ordinance for that section that we could give you some idea of the scope and the cost of both signage, which would have to be by street in this case, and then enforcement costs depending on the extent of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But here we'd have we're pretty broadly defined on the various things you've already added to your motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I just I guess with that, I think we're just honing in on just one specific district and I think there's more districts that have issues. So I mean, if we're going to do that, then maybe I mean, is it possible to do three or four districts?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I'm trying to get some sort of I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think the intent of the pilot is to see how well it works in there and then and then expand it as as you see fit or change it or modify the ordinance if it's not working as as correctly or in accordance with your desires.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But and the timing of that is I do not know how long you would want that pilot program in place before you would consider expanding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, do you mind if I just interject for a second, just maybe before you accept that or not accept that, do you mind for on this issue? Okay. So just let me I think that clearly I think what Councilman Gonzalez his concerns are, of course, is that there's concerns across the city, not just specifically in one part'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of part of the city. And there's also obviously concerns for those that have campers and some legal concerns on the coastal issue. Can I ask you a quick question, Charlie, because I think there's there's there's complexity to ask for a pilot without actually working towards an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Because there could be some complexity to that there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Could we? The pilot would be a pilot ordinance for a specific area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It would be an ordinance because you'd have to create an ordinance for that specific area. That's correct. Okay. So just two questions. So I just remind a little bit, because this is a complex legal issue as well. We know that there are coastal issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's other legal complexities to this. It's similar to when we did the minimum wage conversation. You know, council directed you to do an ordinance, but before you brought back an ordinance, you kind of did a full report on kind of what that would look like, different models.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you brought forward questions that have to be answered by the council before a full ordinance could eventually be implemented. So I just want to just to throw out to the council, I think there's a couple of options here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's a pilot option, which I think could be great, which would be to come back with a draft. I think the motion in that case would be to come back with a draft ordinance on a pilot project that would be a pilot specific area with pilot in the neighborhood, working with the draft, the makers of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the motion. And then dependent on that success or not successful, we would then come back to the council and you'd report on that. So that's, I think, one option. The other option I think would be to direct you to work on on the begin, the beginning of constructing what an ordinance could possibly look like and bringing back'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to the council your kind of legal research on different ordinances on what what the Long Beach model could actually look like that could give people working, you know, connect with the Coastal Commission directly. So we understand what the coastal challenges are and then you can actually bring something back that could be implemented citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We could we could certainly do either one of those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just I think those are I think personally I'm comfortable with either, to be honest, I. I just want to just say that. I think that there is no question that that there actually is. There's a lot of good RV owners out there and a lot of people that are legitimately have concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there also are huge problems with people parking some of these large trailers in RVs and in neighborhoods for weeks at a time. And it happened a lot when I was a councilperson in the first year. I remember it over and over again, the phone calls and trying to get these things moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so there are real concerns, does not put everybody in the same bucket because they're also very good owners that actually are legitimate owners and are doing are not creating blight. So just just to put out there, I think there are two options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Charlie, if you were to go and come back with kind of a legal report on the process, how long would it take?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we could have something back in 30 days or something like that where we could take a look at and maybe come up with how to approach the Coastal Commission and and the steps that are involved if in fact this is to be implemented in the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have given that direction yet. But if the substitute comes to pass as we would, we will be looking at that and coming back with that. So that'll take some time. And then working with public works on the commercial corridors and how to, you know, craft this ordinance so that it's a workable ordinance for us and public'",
        "'speaker_6': 'works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it sounds like there'd be one step in between actually bringing back an ordinance, but it'd be bringing back information of questions to be answered. If we would.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would envision, yes, it would be a combined report from the city manager's office in public works in our office on what we would recommend be included in the ordinance and and the reasons why we would recommend the legal issues to address the legal issues from my side and then maybe from operational issues from the city manager'",
        "'speaker_6': 'side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I just think, you know, there's there's a couple options there. And I think one option is to ask the city attorney to begin the ordinance process, but come back with a legal report after talking to coast commission and the appropriate partners, which would be a citywide approach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then there is a drafting an ordinance for just a a portion of the city. That would be a pilot ordinance. I think those are the two things that are at least that I just want to put on the table there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More option.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other option.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is voting on the item, which.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is voting exactly on the item as presented. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just wanted to to clarify something, if you might, if I might, with the city attorney, all of the the steps that you could go through to do that, could you do that under the existing motion on the floor, checking with Coastal Commission, checking out the feasibility?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We would certainly have to do that before if, if the substitute substitute were to pass as without the friendly amendment from the ninth district. Yes. Because we would have to address and reach out to Coastal Commission staff, etc. to make sure how we could or what are the options for implementing that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Got to go back to Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Well, I would like to stick with a substitute substitute, but I do believe that we need a report in. And that's what I envisioned anyhow. Is that because I had some questions that needed to be clarified in terms of what defines a commercial corridor and that, you know, difference between the business and residences and the Coastal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Commission items that Councilmember Suranga brought up. I think it will give us additional time, you know, to think about things going forward. And also, I think in a pilot program, if I envision that correctly, that is also just piece missing the issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I also feel that if I'm saying in the West Side, you cannot have, you know, RV oversight sites, vehicles that's going to go to another area. And I just think it just moves the issue around. If I'm just thinking preliminarily here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's for sure.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just just jumping in because I kind of got hijacked on my I have three speakers while I was cued up. So here's well, here's what I'm saying. If we have if we have go forward with an ordinance and a study, all of that's fine with me.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The issue I'm talking about is taking this citywide tonight or giving direction to explore it citywide tonight when multiple council people have just said we have concerns in our district. So I don't see an issue. I don't see a I don't see what the issue would be to simply say if they can't if they cannot write the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'ordinance without answering these questions, then explore flexibility and local communities approaches on what they can do, on ways they can do that, because they need some, they need direction. So I would explore both before they bring a city council ordinance back.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's the best of both worlds. You get Mayor Garcia's compromise or his friendly to look at. Answering these questions. And you got and you answer the needs of a number of council members who brought up regional issues like coastal coastal commission stuff to, you know, frankly, having, you know, not sticking it to the guy who's doing'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's what I envision will come back in that report is everything we're discussing all of these issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Let's clarify that. What what everybody understands, the report's going to come back and explore coastal issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What issues? On the West Side issue? You know, all of the issues that we discuss, I would think that, you know, would be brought up residences.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I understand correctly, your motion was not accepted. So it would not discuss a pilot program, but.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It would not evaluated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would discuss the issues that you raised. We were just talking that we would never envision a report coming back to the council, maybe in a memo form, not on the agenda, explaining what we've looked at the process as we see it moving forward for an ordinance and what those key provisions of the ordinance would be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then either the council or you could direct us to bring something back if you'd like to discuss it and or get further direction. And then we would come back with an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And maybe if the friendly included looking at a possible pilot that could maybe satisfy everyone's as an option.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we also have another colleague that's not here. I know that she was on the item, so that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Absolutely. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're very welcome. Very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When I made the motion. To receive a file. Obviously, there were a lot of issues with the with the substance of the request as it is. Based on the discussion that we're having right now, those. That's validated that there are concerns with what is here because you're used to many questions to be answered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's too many other issues to me to be addressed. My main primarily one is, is that I don't want to put the city in the position with the Coastal Commission and also don't want to put staff into a into a quandary of having to address other issues that we have with the city in terms of its LCP'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and whether we have to apply for a for a course of do you have a permit for those areas that are within the coastal zone? And since my receiver file created some. Concerns. I withdraw that they will withdraw my receiver file but only on the contingency that we do the study as as the as the city attorney'",
        "'speaker_3': 'has has requested to check into all aspects of implementing a citywide implementation of this of this magnitude. That would address all of the issues, including coastal issues, because I, I don't see where we can do both. We can have the best of both worlds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, there's going to be some issues with, with, with the coastal, the coastal zone. And and it's not going to be I can tell you right now is that it's going to be it's going to be denied because it's been denied elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While the councilmember price has mentioned that there are other cities that do have it, that is not the current path that that is currently taken. We use address one recently and in Santa Cruz, that guy denied for the very issues that you mentioned earlier about the the intent of the of the of the zoning was not to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'address public safety issues, but the reason was to address homelessness. So people saw through that. So I don't want to put us in that position. So I want to make sure that if we do move forward with any kind of of ordinance or study, that we study it first and that you review it, all aspects of it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cover it thoroughly and completely. And you come with us with recommendations on what an ordinance would look like as opposed to an ordinance because it's not ready. This this request right here is not ready for primetime. That is definitely true.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the only way we can address it is by having a complete study on it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I may, Mayor and Councilmember, just as a point of clarification, you can't withdraw your substitute now because the substitute services on the floor, but you certainly could after the vote on the third motion. But but your point is well taken in that as I understand the substitute substitute motion, it now requires us to come to council'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with a study in the form of a memo to the council on those issues that you've just discussed and raised. And we'll do our best to address all of those issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm glad you brought that up, because it wasn't it wasn't until. The concept of a Richardson right out up again, and there was some discussion on it. So now that Councilmember Gonzalez has agreed to that and I can I can support that, but I can't support the original motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce, then we're going to go to public comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I think that my concerns were twofold. One is, what is the intent? The intent is to ensure safety around streets where we can see visibly and ensure that people can see around the corners and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let's make sure that we are answering that question whenever we come back with the report. Two, what kind of ordinance would help us in that area? If the intent is around public safety, health and safety, around what kind of sewage is being out there, what are some things that we are doing to address that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we're going to how are we going to separate the homeless issue from the public site issue? And that's one thing that it would be extremely important to me and ensuring that if there's something around code violations or things like that, are we doing that on a you know, are we proactively going out there and looking for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it? Is it something that, you know, like other policies that we have on the books where we only do it if it's complaint driven? How big is the problem right now? How many calls do we get in each district?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those are things that I would want to see come back. And, you know, some explanation around the temporary parking zones would be something that I'd be interested in having a follow up conversation with. I can support the idea that's here today, but, you know, that's not that so that we can move forward and get a study back'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So just to be be clear. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So now we're going back to the hour. Did you want to go back to the council first before public got some of Ringo?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to be clear as well is. This is going to be a study. It's not going to be a draft ordinance, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not knowing it would be a study and I would assume that we would have in that report back to you. Some of the key items that we believe, if you decide to go forward, would be included in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it's not an ordinance. It would be elements of an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, as the as I understand the motion, unless the maker changes it, it's a study working towards an ordinance coming back with an ordinance, or the study would identify the issues that you've raised, some of the parameters and some of the challenges that we would see moving forward, and then we would move the next step.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Would we bring you an ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I can I can support that that approach completely. I would I would say just to add a little more to the whole local. The question is about local or local pilot. Explore also, if there's a way, you know, if we end up with, say, a blanket ban in residential, if there are ways'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to where the good guy that owned, you know, owned his RV for 30 years can do the reverse of the preferential parking where they can go collect a petition, explore something like that, collect signatures from their local neighbors to say, hey, this guy has been fined, doesn't live in his camper, he owns his home, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He lives it at his house. Carney Park is his thing here. So as a as a part of this, that's a question I want to see, too. If it goes citywide, what are the tools or tactics cities have used to create that some sort of a process to allow these folks who just would have worked with rather'",
        "'speaker_10': 'working out with their neighbors and go pay, you know, 150 bucks a month for the for the lot rental or or 75 bucks a month. I've heard some people some places have. So that I want to make sure that that's reflected here too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One other thing that I forgot to mention that I would like included in the report is that it's going to cost upwards of $1,000,000 where those dollars are going to come from. So just some background on that would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",

I then went to work for the Los Angeles Police Department, where I retired for 26 years of service in 1995. Since retirement, I've chosen to mentor kids in Long Beach area at risk kids, kids without fathers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I have. And homeless kids I have owned and lived on my property in Long Beach over 40 years. Of course, like all of us, I have seen many changes, both positive and negative. Now, why I'm here today, I am concerned with the city of Long Beach initiating this new ordinance on motorhomes parked in the city streets'",
        "'speaker_11': '. I understand. Completely. Some of the concerns that both the citizens of Long Beach and the city officials have about the growing problem. Years ago, I bought a 36 foot class a motorhome. We haven't talked about motorhomes in their classes and you know, the sizes, so which is really important.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I bought a 36 foot class-A motorhome because the size is not because of its size and where I live. I acquired a space of storage that I could find ten miles away in the city of Cypress on Lincoln.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'After several years, I realized how difficult it was for me. Every time I decided to travel in my motorhome to drive out that distance, leave my car there, drive back, load my motorhome, go out on my trip, come back, unload my motorhome and drive back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As Vice Mayor Richardson said, it takes a lot of time. So I thought, well, it's time to downsize. And I could park my motorhome in front of my house if I bought a smaller one. So I bought a classy 23 foot motorhome.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My motorhome takes up about as much space as a large van, and I moved it every Friday for street sweeping. And I have for the last five years, I use my motorhome approximately 10 to 15 times a month and sometimes more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I bought it. I brought it a day I bought a day pass at both of Chica Beach, where I sometimes take kids when I mentor them and sometimes just for my getaway. Although you say this is a new ordinance and has nothing to do with homeless concerns now happening within the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's not true. I too have seen the homeless parked within the city and those areas. I too have seen that they dump their sewers or their sewage in the gutters, and I am concerned about that too. I am.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But there are different ways that we can deal with this without having this broad umbrella, this blanket ordinance that's going to say all motorhomes are oversize, vehicles are the problem because that's not the problem.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'I'm going to go out on a limb here and say they'll pay for their signs. We would pay for very nice signs at our businesses. If the city could draft an ordinance that wouldn't allow them to park there because they're they're creating serious problems on the west side that people in these motorhomes have threatened employees and owners'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of businesses. They they're selling drugs out of their motor homes. And they are they're urinating and defecating in front of business people and outside and dumping dumping their trash in the streets. And it's a serious problem on the west side does not want motorhomes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Westside Industrial Area does not want motorhomes in their areas, parking. They don't want an ordinance that would be for oversize vehicles because the west side is a trucking area. So if you have trucks there at night, they're there because they're loading or unloading.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they they they don't park overnight. If they park overnight, they should be in violation. But if they're there working in their businesses, they shouldn't be cited. So you can't just use a blanket and say oversize vehicles, it has to be restricted recreational vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's what the West Side would see is no recreational vehicle parking in the West Side, period. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. Especially to Councilwoman Gonzalez. She is the representative from my district and she's been helping me and listening to my plight. I am on the west side as well. I run a restaurant and I'd like to unfortunately point out the bad side of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are views that I'm speaking of are not the ones that are packing up the kids and the dog and going to the beach for the day or going on a trip. These are the individuals that are in some compromised phase of their lives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's unfortunate. But I also have to point out that they're compromising our ability to conduct business there. I'll give a specific story of customers. A lot of our customers walk to the restaurant, and sometimes I don't see them for a period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I've asked specific groups of them and they told me that they don't want to walk to the store anymore because of the smell. So these are these are messy. They don't contain to just the parameters of their vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They spread out the mess. It's physical blocking of pedestrians, sidewalks and our driveways. It's visible blight. And I don't want to be in that category of, oh, it's the West Side, and sometimes it's messy. I don't want the mess the West Side to be messy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I make my most sincere efforts to hold the standards high for the West Side. And I think these are these are compromising my efforts. So I think it's super important that. We focus on the West Side as one of the hotspots, and it'd be great if we could be the pilot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Come study us plenty because we are one of the hotspots I feel. Come put up the signs, as Paul stated. Yeah. I'd love to help pay for the science if it goes on my street over there, but definitely put down the west side as a hotspot that needs attention.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the last thing I want to state is I know these things are complicated and we have to study all facets, but the West Side has run out of time because my customers are eventually going to give.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Up and they.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Won't want to walk to the store. They're going to get in a car and drive somewhere else because they don't want to walk to my store. And, you know, we have to look at the big picture, I guess, but my picture is how many customers that I lose that day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just wanted to say that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you for listening to us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I might ask you is Mike Flynn. I live in L.A. Heights. I own an RV. I started a charity Carson RV. You can't you can only get it from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to get it out of the lot.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I work during the week long days about it to take the family on vacations, on the weekends. And so for me to do that, coming home from work on a Tuesday, I'll pick it up, load it up again if it's a long weekend.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Coming back on a Sunday. I got to work the next day. It takes days to get it packed up. I pay for it to store it. I only park it in front of my house. But 48 hours is just not enough.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, it's the four or five day thing, but it's totally unreasonable for us that are doing the proper thing and taking our families on vacation to get roped into. Obviously there's other issues, but for it being registered on a block, there should be more amount of time for using it for family vacations and whatnot to get'",
        "'speaker_11': 'it back. Just unfeasible otherwise. Thanks.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor and Council. My name is Andy Kerr. I'm the vice chair of the Homeless Services Advisory Committee, and I represent Councilman Austin's District eight. First of all, I just want to thank you, Mr. Mayor, and the Council, for your leadership in putting the homeless study session on the agenda for this evening, and that it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'was a really productive discussion. I didn't want to take up time earlier from the really important speakers that spoke earlier on the issue of homelessness. But I felt compelled to to speak on this issue while I completely understand the quality of life issues that were brought up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On this issue, I thought it was important to to also bring up the homelessness issue. And I appreciate the council's concerns and sensitivity in light of what we heard tonight and talking about this issue. And while I'm not concerned about the intentions, because I know most of you personally and I know your intentions on this, I'm worried'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about the net results of what some more restrictions might have on the issue of homelessness. And are we driving more people to losing the only shelter they have because of tickets and violations? Are we driving more homeless people from the community?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not intentionally, but as a net result of more restrictions. So I would just just ask that and I'm not encouraging the council to not take action because I think the quality of life issues are important. But I would just I think maybe this is an opportunity of how we can create a win win and address the issues'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that we heard earlier this evening on the issues of homelessness and address these concerns at the same time. There's a couple cities in the central coast city of Santa Barbara and the city of Monterey that have done some really innovative things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On creating safe parking spaces for people experiencing homelessness and are living in their vehicles, both ARVs and just living in their cars. And I think maybe there's an opportunity to do something creative there. It's also a way to partner with nonprofit agencies such as one of the existing organizations in the S.O.S., or maybe a new partner that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we can bring into the S.O.S. to provide supportive services, to have people instead of spread out all over the city, to have them in one place. I was glad Councilmember Price brought up the Multi-Service Center and already talking to our folks in the Health Department about maybe creating a space there, I am concerned about the capacity at'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the Multi-Service Center. I think maybe there is very limited capacity. And does that capacity meet the need of folks that are living in their vehicles in the city? Maybe it is. I don't know, but I would hope maybe we would look at that issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if that isn't an appropriate issue or appropriate space for safe parking, maybe there's someplace else that we could partner with churches, with other nonprofit agencies. So that's it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Andy. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Mark Nevin and I live in only two sites and I support the intent of the end of the ordinance. I just don't think that, you know, we should be wrapped up in, you know, RV owners that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Store their.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their RVs offsite in a storage lot should be wrapped up in the in the ordinance. The time frame for loading and unloading is not sufficient for, you know, for families loading up an RV, especially if you're on it, you're going on a big trip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's just. It's just not. Not enough time. The other component of the ordinance was oversize vehicles, which are defined as 20 feet and larger. A pickup truck with a crew cab and a standard bed is 21 feet six inches.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that would, in essence, make all those trucks illegal to park on the city of London, on any street, on any street in the city of Long Beach. So I think that should be changed to most in the in the memo that you that was in the in the report, you brought up a couple of other cities'",
        "'speaker_3': ', and they had also changed their oversize vehicle ordinance to 22 feet, which I think would be. Probably a good idea to do in Long Beach, too, since that's the size, you know, that would that would eliminate the modern modern pickup of today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The. That was it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Speaker Patrick Watson, fourth district. Like the last person said, my Dodge pickup truck that I drove my family around in is now illegal by her ordinance that she wants to pass. That's ridiculous. I also appreciate Mr. Richardson's common sense on the matter as far as giving people ample time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'd also like to know what the statistics are on how many accidents are caused by RVs being parked in front of residences. You know, you keep bringing that point over and over again. I'd be curious, you know, maybe the city attorney or the manager can bring up those stats because I doubt there are very many on the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'residential streets. I could see the major business fares, $1,000,000 for signage, the amount of money to do the studies that we're all talking about tonight, the added budget for parking enforcement and our police to do this. Are we taking this?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You were the heroine of the homeless situation. Are we taking this from the homeless or is this money coming from. We don't have money in the city. So let's pinpoint the areas that we have to work on it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm sure there's a camping ordinance. Target the camping if there are people living in RVs. Target the camping ordinance. Don't punish the people at work. One last thing are the people that in my neighborhood, they're plumbers, electricians, carpenters, drywall.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They have work trucks. They come home from work and they park in front of their house so they can get up at, oh, dark 30 to go to work, support their family. They can't park it from their house now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What about the guy that has a cement pumper because he pumps concrete. Can he no longer come home? Does he have to rent a parking spot to go park his work truck and then drive home or getting Uber?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Let's just. I'm just asking for common sense before we come out with these ordinances that just blanket everybody and punish people. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you to treat them in the fourth district and similar to some of the other comments. The time frame on the RV owners, I think is is too short. And personally, I've moved from the third district to the fourth District in an effort to get more room and have more property and be able to park my RV'",
        "'speaker_11': 'when I need to in front of my house for a few days. I store it in an office of storage lot and a boat, and if I want to use it, I need to bring it home. Use it, come home, go to work for a day, unload it, get it back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Like many people said, a lot of these lots, they're not open very long. You can get there from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., 6pma lot of us can't get there that time. You need another day or two. You take my boat to Catalina.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Where do I put my trailer? You won't let me leave it in the launch ramp for more than three or four days. So I leave it in front of my house. What am I going to do with it while I'm gone now?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's a lot of different issues. I can understand a lot of the West Side. I'm a business owner in the city. I think there's a lot of definition we could work on between cities. City streets, figure out the terminology, use the boulevards and our neighborhood, the central neighborhood areas that are off the street.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't think we need to target right now. Let's target the stuff. You know, I see Bellflower Boulevard. I see Los Coyotes. I see examiner. That's easy. Let's put some signage on those streets. And do you have enforcement opportunities already on the books that have been there for years?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That can be 72 hours for the residents if they start putting it in by residents. I can call. We can get rid of those people if they move somewhere else. So at this time, I don't think the residential smaller areas need to have the enforcement that some of the other businesses need, the West Side and some of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Other business districts. I definitely see the need for that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think it's something that needs to be looked at. I never heard about this. I just saw it on social media. So we came down. I didn't see the opportunity to have any input, so I think more input from the entire community would be something we need to work on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Angela Kimball. Good evening. Uh, Mayor Council. I live just outside of the city of Long Beach. I live in the county unincorporated island. And we have a significant problem in our area that is surrounded by the city of Long Beach with RV stored throughout our community on our streets for extended periods of time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We actually had an RV at the end of our street. My street on Gondor Avenue, actually, it was stored on Conant on the city side of the property for four months with people living in it and it did not move.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Slide outs out. 35 foot motor home.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Huge, huge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beast with people living in it continuously. They would move it around the corner on street, sweeping day on Conant and then back around on back to go on it. One of the big concerns that I have tonight is the problem with these RVs, boats and trailers that are surrounding Patrick Henry School, which is the city of Long'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beach School. The county sheriff has worked really hard with their resources to try to keep that area clean and clear of RVs, boats and trailers. We have kids crossing the street in between these vehicles. It's very unsafe over there for these kids to cross to go to school.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that is one of our big concerns. There's a lot of great RV owners heard a lot of them tonight, but we have a lot of RV use in our neighborhood that are actually registered to the city. Now, people who live in the city of Lakewood, because they passed an ordinance back in 2006, overwhelmingly their voters, they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'went to the polls and they had had enough of this RV all over their community. So we're asking you to really evaluate this on us and take a citywide approach, because these piecemeal ordinances do not work. We see what's going on up around Skylands golf course.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have people living in RVs all up and down. You piecemeal it up with signage up there and there they move the RV for from to to from.'",
        "'speaker_12': '2 a.m. to.'",
        "'speaker_1': '6 a.m. and then they're back and there's trash and debris and sewage dumped in the streets there. And it's a huge issue for all the families living in those residences all around. So we're just asking you to take a citywide approach.'",

I'm 77, so, you know, but. I have an issue that I've been trying to work out for eight years through councilman ship ski and now Stacie Mango, who I wish was'",
        "'speaker_11': 'here. But I appreciate Mrs. Price invited me to come out. We're I'm sitting on a service road. A service road, which is probably a good car with narrower than a normal street. But you allow parking on both sides.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when you get an RV on one side and RV on the other side. I've seen the fire department actually have to push in mirrors to barely inch through this thing to get to the restaurant at the end of where I live.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I don't think there should be that kind of vehicle. Unless there's only parking maybe on one side of the street. The other thing is, is we don't have a stop sign for the street that has a lot of traffic on 28th Street going through.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so when you try to get out, you can't see down 28th. There's no stop sign for them there to stop. So you can maybe inch out. So you really are playing with your life a little bit. Other thing is cars are coming in from the main street and they get they don't have to stop for anything'",
        "'speaker_11': 'either. It's kind of difficult sometimes the safety issues that come about. The other thing is the stop sign on the service road sits almost eight feet back from the from the other side of the service road. They don't have to stop.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You can't see if a big vehicle parked right there all the way to, you know, in here to the end of the street. So. I've been trying to do this for eight years. I've talked to this person for eight years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's him and his wife. I came home even at two, 2:00 this afternoon, 212 vehicles that were parked there, owned by that particular couple. Two cars. The rest of them were a 32 foot RV, a foot attached, a 15 foot trailer behind it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'He has a steak truck. He's got well, they're all big vehicles. All I want to do is have peace, peaceful enjoyment in my home and be able to know that I have some safety around there. Not everybody will come out now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't know if I can do this, but. A good friend of mine came to visit me and said, she's an ex mayor of one of the cities in the South Bay. And she said, What the hell is this?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I said, I know I've been dealing with this for quite a long time. So she said, Well, if you can't get it straight with your current council person, then see the city manager. So I have some photos that I would like to leave as are possible that I can do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. In fact, sir, I'm going to we're going to contact you tomorrow at my office, and we're going to work with Mr. Beck as well. This RV issue, we have to obviously is not resolved tonight. There may be some other traffic issues there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That we can help here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we will we will we will take we promise that we will be in touch tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm kind of glad I came here now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, go ahead and pass this, Mr. Beck here. This is our director of Public Works. He's going to contact you directly and we're going to go out there and take a look at your street. Okay. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, I'm Aaron Wilhelm. I was born and raised in Long Beach. I'm in the fourth district. I've owned my home for 25 years and I am married, have four kids that I've raised in college. We have an RV.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We just sold our boat. We also have a motorcycle trailer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because that's what we do. We go camping and we store them offsite, but we bring it home just like the other people that you know. And it might take a week ahead of time because depending on when we have to pick it up and drop it off and you've heard all this, but and I, I don't like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the idea of doing a pilot program in a district because if you are. Pick our district because I can guarantee all the neighbors will. I mean, you're going with all the calls that are coming in saying, hey, we have a problem here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a problem here. Our neighbors don't call and say, hey, we've got great neighbors that have an RV. We have great neighbors that have a boat. You don't get those calls. So you think they're not there. So do a pilot program, the fourth District, and you're going to have no one complaining.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Everyone has their Arby's offsite. Some of them some people keep them in the neighborhood. And they're very nice neighbors. Right. But if you do a pilot program where her store restaurant is and I get what she's saying, but you do a pilot program there, then you're going to screw the rest of us over in the fourth District'",
        "'speaker_1': ', on the east side, or wherever good neighbors are. And we have our Arby's. So I don't like the idea of a pilot program in one district because it's not going to work for everyone else, because if you do it in our district, she's going to get.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Screwed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's not fair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, I you know, as far as the size limits, too. My husband has a large truck. That, again, is it would be considered oversize. Some people have boats. They're small. So where are you going to cut it off?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This boat's 18 feet. So it's okay to park on the street every day. It's okay to park in the main thoroughfare. Like, are you going to tickets? Are you going to tow people, confiscate stuff? I don't I don't know what you're doing and where you're going to go with all this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, I like Richardson. Austin's ideas about just everything they said seem to make more sense than what Mr. Price said. I don't care for her. Um, her, whatever it's called. But anyway, I just. I didn't. And then someone else was saying parking the driveway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a 30 foot motorhome, so I can't bring it home parked in the driveway because it's going to block the sidewalk and block the street. So then she can't walk her dog. We do park it in the street in front of our house and we put the cord above the motorhome to the balcony so that she's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not going to trip on it. So she just complained about it being on the sidewalk, but she also complained about it being up top, but up top, it's above where anyone could even jump and grab it so that it's not a nuisance anyone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not going to be a danger to anyone. And we're being responsible neighbors that are charging our motor home so that we can go on vacation with our family. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. And our final speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. The definition of a motorhome.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is mobile living. Mobile living. Regardless of where you're living.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's mobile living. And it just so happens that there's a segment of our community who really are living in those things. They're not vacationing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I wonder how.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Inconvenient the Indians were when the first Europeans arrived here. Our convenient were they buy by the very trafficking on the ocean coming back and forth bringing all that stuff. They had to handle that. And they've done it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They handled it so much so that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'American Indians have but the real Americans have been pushed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Over and we hardly ever see the Indians.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anymore. They were so inconvenience and they took it in stride.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They lost their land because of it. Our discussion here of mobile, living and hazardous to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What really are we? What's the intent?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What really are we saying? And I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going to read my prepared. Short story. Because some people's lives, their livelihoods are dependent upon the decision that you're going to make tonight. Or won't be made. What is the inherent detriment in the complaint to the neighborhood, the neighbors, the streets that warranted this ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Did you ever say, really, what's bothering you, Mr. Smith? You get tired of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Looking at that thing every day. Do you know who's living in that being? Miss Jefferson? Have you ever knocked on the door and.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Offered a bottle of water?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And can I help you with anything? How easy is it to inconvenience the homeless? Just because the neighbors don't like the look on the street. I lived in a motor home and I'm about to purchase another one because.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My work for the homeless requires that I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be on well on point wherever they are 24 hours a day, just in case they need me. How I got the first home. Somebody called me and said, You need a motor home for the kind of work you're doing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to have it delivered to you in a flatbed truck. They paid the insurance on it for the whole year. And I told them.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Lady, I dreamt that I had a motorhome five years ago. Let's be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Honest here. They are people who are homeless, who are living in these things. And the city can't provide anything for them. For whatever the reason. What is the itemized resolve for this for this ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Assad. The last speaker, Mr. Goode, here. And then we're going back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right, good. You. It seems to me at the beginning, in the end, it boils down to no matter what district, it is the public safety issue. There are large vehicles. Whether to be a motor home recreational vehicle, or what if they present a public safety issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That issue needs to be addressed. Period. And listening to this, one of the things that came to mind. Is this a great business opportunity there for somebody? Because there's obviously a need for. Location to find locations for a number of these.'",

There's no reason why there cannot be a mobile home courts set up for people that are. Living in them as their permanent residence or a temporary residence.'",

And I know sometimes when we come to council meetings, we have certain things in our mind and we're anxious to say them. But when I started off the comment, this is for some of my neighbors who are up there and the woman'",
        "'speaker_9': 'from the fourth district. Sometimes we think that we make certain assumptions. When I started off, what I said was, I'm very open to hearing what my colleagues think about this and and talking about how we can draft an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then one of the speakers talked about having, you know, read my proposal. My actual proposal for tonight specifically talks about a situation and the need for a proposal that's very different than residential people using it to parking it outside of their home for a limited period of time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It says constituents report that vehicles are parked in front of homes and businesses for weeks or even months at a time, taking up valuable parking spaces, blocking view corridors and limiting access to driveways and alleys. In many cases, the occupant is illegally living inside the vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Additionally, residents have observed several instances of individual disposing waste from the vehicles into stormwater drains, as well as report of portable gas generators being used as a power source. So that was the reason it came forward. So the definition of oversize vehicle is actually not my definition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not what I was proposing. It's actually currently in the Long Beach Municipal Code and has been for years, and it defines an oversize vehicle, as you stated, 85 inches high or 80 inches wide or 20 feet long.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Several other residents, actually, it was passed in 2005. Several other cities have definitions, and I think that's a really great point for us to think about expanding the size, because three of the cities that are cited have a 22 feet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think that's an excellent point and that's something that we should definitely consider updating our ordinance. The other thing is in terms of the time to load and unload. Councilman, one of my one of my council colleagues and I actually it was Councilman Austin who actually used the example of his own situation where he wasn't able'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to return it in time. We actually had a conversation. Most people returned from a holiday on a Sunday and they probably have to go back to work the next day. So moving it in 48 hours is probably not realistic.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where that came from again is the current ordinance. Also, the city of Lakewood has it looks like a three day loading and unloading. SEAL Beach has a it looks here like they have a two day loading. It looks like Huntington Beach has a three day loading.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Newport Beach has a one day loading. Costa mesa has a 48 hour, two day one. So every city, it looks like it's about 24 to 72 hours. We can certainly make that longer. That's not the issue. Again, the intent of the ordinance isn't to go after residential owners who store their vehicles off site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I live in Alamitos Heights too. I get daily emails and complaints from people regarding some particular spots where people are parking on the street for an extended period of time. And although sometimes neighbors may not share that with their neighbors, that it bothers them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They certainly share it with their council member. So we're trying to find an ordinance that is fair. And obviously we don't want to punish people who store their vehicles. There are in the city of Long Beach currently. Ten different places where you can store your vehicle ranging from anywhere 75, $75 a month to $200 a month, depending'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on the size of your vehicle. So there's a lot of opportunities. We want to encourage people to use offsite storage. We want to allow ample time for people to load and unload. But we also want to address some of the growing issues that we're seeing in terms of an increase in the number of RVs that we're seeing'",
        "'speaker_9': 'parked in residential neighborhoods and commercial corridors. So I just I did want to clarify that and let you know that you're being heard. And really the intent of the ordinance was not to go after people who are traveling on vacation and fact that my my ordinance my proposal actually says as the summer months come to a close'",
        "'speaker_9': ', fewer families will be using RVs and trailers for recreation. So this is an appropriate time of year to address a change to the municipal code that would provide adequate time for everyone to become aware of any changes before major travel months are upon us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we're trying to work with residents who have RVs and figure out a solution that works. And like I said at the beginning of this discussion, I'm open to finding out what works for everyone as we move forward on this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it is a very, very controversial issue. And just because your neighbor may tell you that they're okay with it doesn't mean that's not what they're telling. That's not doesn't mean that's what they're telling their council person. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I'll try to keep it brief. I'm reminded that years ago, one of our colleagues, Councilmember Andrews, had explored the idea of having safe parking places within our churches and possibly with some of those nonprofits that provide services to our homeless community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would like to ask and I can do this, you know, put on agenda item down the road. But I would like to say that I'd like to propose that we get a report back on safe parking initiatives that have been done in places like Santa Barbara.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As Commissioner Kern brought up that there are some opportunities that we can possibly partner with the Multi-Service Center, with some of these churches, with the places that provide services so that we have two outcomes. One, we're getting some of the people that are living in their cars off of the the residential streets and corridors that are important'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to us. And two, that we're finding another way to connect them with services that will help them hopefully get back on their feet. And so I don't know that that needs to be a part of this item, but I can direct staff, you know, in a more formal, formal way to to come back with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think if we're doing that alongside this initiative, that that's something that I would definitely be supportive of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to add a piece to the story that I told Councilmember Price and I let everybody else in on a little earlier. So on the fifth day when I got ready to return, the RV code enforcement was sitting outside of my house writing me a ticket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there is some enforcement in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we're going to go back to the motion on the floor, which I'm going to have repeated, just to make sure that we all know what we're what's being voted on. So, Mr. City Attorney, can you repeat the motion on the floor, which I believe is a substitute substitute by Councilmember Gonzalez?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct, Mayor. The motion that I have is a substitute submitted made by Councilmember Gonzalez, seconded by Councilmember Price, would be to now as amended, would be to prepare a study from the city attorney's office and from city management that would look at a number of issues that an ordinance like this would or may create.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they include the business district banning the definition of oversize vehicles, the application at service roads or access roads, prohibited parking in front of businesses, definition of commercial corridors. Addressing the Coastal Commission issues including coastal zone, possible CDP, coastal development permits and and the impact on the local coastal plan pilot options.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The number of hours increasing for in front of residential to 48 to 72 possible tools to allow for parking in front of residential houses different hours different the number of hours for in front of businesses would be less than what is in front of residential.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the public safety issue of illegal dumping and the notice requirements to implement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's just a report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. That that would be the report that we would try and answer those questions that have been raised tonight in a report to council. And in that report, if we're able maybe put in some suggestions that public works and the traffic engineer have on how we could craft an ordinance to address these issues, and then we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'would take further direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So just to be clear, it's a report that's comprehensive on all those issues, and that's the motion on the floor. It's not an ordinance. It's to get information and bring it back to the city council. And I would also just add, there's a lot of folks that came tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there'll be plenty of opportunities, too, in that report comes out to everyone. Take a read, take a look and have some further discussions about this issue because there's a lot of people interested as well. And I just want to re-emphasize something that Councilman Price said and having I know that she talked to me about this issue'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and I know that her intention has been completely to try to focus on those problematic areas that have been a blight on a neighborhood. And so whether it's the issue out in West Long Beach, there's other other campers that stay out for weeks.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, Councilman Austin, this is really exploratory work that De SA is doing to ensure that their pipeline cathartic protection system is working. Cathartic protection keeps a metal pipe that's in the ground from degrading as quickly as it would without it.'",
