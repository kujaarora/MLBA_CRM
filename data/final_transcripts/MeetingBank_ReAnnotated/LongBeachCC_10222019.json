    "Visioning Effort and Funding for Downtown Shoreline Specific Plan. ": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Some have folks are in the audience and I'm going to try to get to these at the start of the agenda as much as possible. We're going to go ahead and here, item 19, please be quick.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Item 19 is a report from the Development Services recommendation to initiate a visioning effort for the downtown Shoreline Planet Development Zoning District, District two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Modica. Can we get to just a short staff presentation? I think the. The staff reporters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who have been taught staff report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By Linda Tatum and Christopher Coons.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mayor, and members of the council. This is a presentation regarding a proposed visioning process for the downtown shoreline area. And. Excuse me. The downtown plan is the success of the downtown plan owes a lot of its success to the effort that the city took to actually conduct a visioning process before enacting the plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we'd like to do something similar with the downtown, with the PD six area. The PD six is that area one of the most scenic areas in the city on the waterfront? It is. Let's see. Thank you, Tom.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There we go. Pediatrics area was last updated by the city back in the 1980s, and it is the area south of Ocean between the Los Angeles River and Alameda Street there. And it contains some of the most visited sites in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And since the city's announcement or the city's selection for the 2028 Olympics, there has been an intense level of interest in development activity in the PD six area. So the city is going to take advantage of that interest and conduct a visioning exercise for this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This property and that process will be very similar to what we did for the the downtown plant. It was a very community oriented, a lot of community engagement. So I'll walk you through very briefly what that process will look like.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The objectives of this process is to establish a stakeholder, a very strong community outreach effort. We would identify stakeholders to essentially establish a consensus about the future development within the PD six area. The other objective is to strengthen the connections between this area and the downtown.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right now there is. We could do a much better job of getting those that visit the shoreline area to come into the downtown and vice versa. So that will be one of the objectives of the visioning exercise. Fundamentally, the other purpose of this process would be to establish a framework so that we can subsequently prepare a specific'",
        "'speaker_9': 'plan. And it is the specific plan that will be very similar to what we did in the downtown in terms of establish some key goals and developing consensus around how we can best enhance that area and enhance provide the kinds of activities and spur investment in that area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that process would essentially be led by a consultant and driven by a consultant and staff guided process. The idea would we would have a series of committees or working groups that would represent various stakeholder groups in the community and develop consensus around some of the topics and some of the objectives of the plan or of the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'process. We would also conduct economic trends analysis with the idea being to identify the opportunities in the area as well as some of the strengths that we can build on in the shoreline area. In terms of a timeline.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Very briefly, we envision this to be about an 18 month process and that would start up early 2020. And the very next steps in this process is staff will be working with the city manager's office and with the mayor's office in the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we will be bringing back to council in December a very detailed work program and a schedule for this effort. We would work to start selecting a consultant to to guide this process, working with staff sometime in early 2020 and then initiate the working groups in the second quarter of 2020.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's essentially an overview of that process. We look forward to engaging the community, resident groups, business groups, property owners, waterfront interests to make sure that as we establish some kind of a consensus about how we can best invest in that area and capitalize and have a specific plan in place by the time 2028 rolls around.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we host the 2028 Olympics here in Long Beach. That concludes the staff presentation, and I'm available for any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. A great presentation. The only thing I will add is that obviously updating our are different plans across the city has been a priority. I really want to thank the staff for presenting this and bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anything councilmember pearce will agree, pd six is a critical piece of of our of our infrastructure and our economy and the area. And so I just want to thank you for the work, Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I too, want to thank you guys for the work. I know that we've done visioning just at the Rainbow Lagoon area and understand the process before us. Just like in downtown, when we did the downtown plan, we saw that it invited so much new developments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We see that we had, I think, up to eight cranes in our downtown over the last several years. And so we welcome this process again with this area. I'd like to just highlight that one of the things that has been important to my district is the fact that a lot of it is shared with tourists and making'",
        "'speaker_7': 'sure that when we develop these areas that we're really inviting the rest of Long Beach to come to our waterfront. And we're saying that this is your waterfront and everything that we can do to try to make sure that transportation is accessible, that when we're updating our plans, we're looking at community benefit agreements and things like that'",
        "'speaker_7': ', ways that we can ensure that the development will be inclusive and diverse. So really looking forward to the process. Thanks for everything that you guys have done so far. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I support the study. Thank you, Councilmember Gringo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know you guys are ready to dot the I's and cross the t's. However, this is within the coastal zone. Is that correct? So we exist within our local coastal plan, the LCP.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. This would require an action and approval by the the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm guessing that you're going to have a timeframe timeline to bring it to the Coastal Commission in the near future. Date in the future.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, we will include that in the the memo that comes the council that outlines the process in some detail. We will kind of outline the steps of the visioning process and the subsequent specific plan process, because it's the specific planning process that will be subject to the coastal action, not the visioning process itself.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to make sure that we are timely on this. Obviously the Coastal Commission has its own schedule and I want to make sure that we have the time to have an opportunity to where to count to the commission when we are here locally, whether Long Beach or somewhere in the in the southern region.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember. Mr.. Good to hear any public comment. No. Members, please cast your votes.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Mongo. Ocean cares.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Item 17, please. I'm Phil Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Item 17 This communication from Councilwoman Price Recommendation two closed a pedestrian bridge at Emefiele Avenue in order to address persistent crime and public safety issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I do want to hear from the public on this. I know there are members of the public here, but before I do that, I want to state that the motion is actually different than the agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rather than requesting a closure of the bridge. We're going to be requesting pin code for the gate so that people, anyone requesting the code can get the code and be able to access both neighborhoods through the gate. And that's the proposal on the floor tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to hear from the public about it, and we can talk a little bit about it. But I know there are competing standpoints and concerns with with the bridge access. And so we want to make sure that we address those concerns while providing access to anyone who should want to have it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that, if it's okay with you, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to go to the public comment, but I wanted to make sure everyone knew that it wasn't a bridge closure that we were talking about at this juncture.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And there's no need to stand, folks. I do have the public the the list. And so I will call you in the call the first few folks up. Okay. So the speaker's list and because we have more than ten, it will be it will be 90 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in this order, Mr. Goodhew, Zari Morrell, Dan Lowenthal, Amelia Ghareeb and Ron King are the first five speakers to please come forward in that order. And if I mispronounce your name, I apologize. So please, please line up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's Mr. Goodhue, Zoe Morrell, Dan Lowenthal, Amelia Ghareeb and Ron King. Please come forward. Thank you. It's good to hear.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Hey, how are you doing? How are you, man? How you doing, customer? Christ. My name is Dr. Zoe Morrell and I actually live in Park Estates and I love living there and had always felt safe. However, the two most important things to me are my daughter's one day.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Luckily, I have a practice in a usually in Los Angeles, I have a practice now in Los Alamitos. I got a call that somebody, a skinhead who looked like he was high on drugs, was throwing rocks at my house, called the police.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And obviously this is a low priority item. Ten, 15 minutes went by. I got another call. No one was there. I actually went home. Went home. And that person was across the street, had tried to break into my house.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I am not a person who has weapons. I'm a surgeon and I had a sledgehammer. So I went to try to disarm this guy with a sledgehammer. I called my across the street neighbor, who's also a physician. He happened to come home, called the cops again, who I respect and really appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Still, no one was there. We had to physically disarm this person as he was breaking in to my across the street neighbor's house. Now, unbeknownst to me, his daughter was home. I only thought if my daughters were home, his daughter was home and she runs out after she keeps calling the police.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Until we told them that he had a weapon. She wanted them to know that the two black guys actually were the ones who were the heroes and that we were the ones with the weapon trying to disarm this gentleman so that we would not get injured.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is really an issue because my daughters, I love to have them walk around the block. My my youngest started a dog walking business. I can't have her do that anymore. My other one babysits kids throughout the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can't have her do that anymore because they don't feel safe and it is unsafe. And I really think that disclosure will help solve that problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'SLAUGHTER Which is a long thought.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Good evening. It's an honor to be here. Thank you, Councilwoman Price, for all of your hard work. I strongly support this item. The I think context is important. When Park Estates was built in 1948, there was no bridge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was no access from Atherton about ten or 11 years after that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There previously had been a creek behind Park Estates that ran parallel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To Atherton on the south side of Atherton. The county came in and built a storm drain. At that time, they granted a six foot easement from Atherton to reach the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Storm drain, and they.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Did a cement bridge over.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The storm drain. Both of those things were for access for the maintenance workers, not for public access into park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Estates, but it became.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Commonly used for that purpose. That is not necessarily problematic, except two things have developed since that time. One is that there's a little alcove.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next to the bridge. It's entirely unlit, it's hidden, it's out of you can't be viewed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'By law enforcement, and it's become a magnet of criminal activity. There are commonly syringes can be found there. Remnants of packages that are stolen from the neighborhood can be found there. People sleep there. The second thing is the bridge provides ingress and egress into the neighborhood for burglaries to be committed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My home was burglarized. I put up a sophisticated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Video surveillance system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was probably torn down. The home was burglarized again. My neighbor's home was burglarized.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the commonality of all of these burglaries is each instance the person comes from across the bridge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Enters through a window, burglarized is the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Home, and then escapes back across the bridge undetected because it's just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So out of you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr.. Thank you. Thank you so much. Our next speaker, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Amelia Greve. I am a resident of Sovereign Park Estates, which is a 156 unit owner, occupied cooperative apartments directly next to that bridge that we've heard so much about. I depend on that bridge to safely walk.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My dog is a woman alone. My elder elderly neighbors depend on that bridge to go to church, to go to social areas, to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Go over the crooked duck, to get their exercise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am that's my all that is our residents only access to safe, walkable areas. We don't have crosswalks across Atherton. All we have is traffic and E-Scooters. I do not have $1,000,000 home. I am a public school teacher, but I have that bridge and I have a safe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Place to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Walk and so do my residents. I strongly urge you to please keep it open for our neighborhood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Ron King.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. I too live in the Park Estates area, and this Alfred L filled bridge. It's about nine homes up from me or down from me, actually. And I noticed that when I first moved in the area, I saw this, you know, on a just a walk around the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I saw this bridge. I thought, this is kind of odd. I walked over and it just goes over to the next street, goes over the wash area, the flood control area. And that was about it. But things also I noticed that after 20 some odd years of living, there is the crime.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Escalated. And we live in an area right there in that area that there's no through roads or whatnot. You either live there, you don't, or you're just totally lost. And I wasn't surprised about the crime escalating. So the crime found me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My car was parked in in the driveway, probably. 30 yards from the street. And my fault. I didn't lock the door, but I got up the next day and it had been vandalized and everything thrown out of the car.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Had some samples from my employment thrown all over my all over my driveway in the front yard. I thought that was quite odd. So time passed and whatnot. And this, this last year we were burglarized, which I thought, this is this is just crazy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I will say this in closing, and that is the only traffic people I see. Disturbing people, per se. I mean, I said the good, the bad. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Time. Time's up. Six where I go. I want to keep the time timely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If my time's up. Yes, I didn't look.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, sir. Let me go ahead. The next five speakers are Melissa Paulson, Garrett DiGiorgio, Ted Bruder, Tyler Paulsen and Ruth one. Please come forward in that order. Melissa Paulsen. Gary Director. Georgio Ted Aberdare. Tyler Paulson and Ruth one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. I'm a resident of Park Estates.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to say that I strongly support this measure for the safety of my home and my family.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. My name's Gary DiGiorgio. I live 12 doors down from this opening. I just want to say that, uh.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Progressively things have gotten worse in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My home has been burglarized. They've caught individuals directly in front of my home breaking into cars.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's just it's a slippery slope and it's getting worse. Having worked in law enforcement for 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will tell you that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In terms of first responders, fire is not coming through there to save anybody. From a police perspective.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would enable them to hold a perimeter for.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'People who are in that community. For those that say, hey, I use it to walk through regularly, I would say that we have three other entry points. It would be a five minute more of a walk, which.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think is the councilwoman said earlier. Walking is healthy. It's good for everyone. So I would I would just ask that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, we definitely look at having a keycard or a complete closure. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Unit speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Ted Brunner. I am the track rep for that tract that has the entrance on Allen Field. I am also the president of the Park Estates Homeowners Association. I started this discussion with Suzy and Jack and Craig from Department of Public Works.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About a year and a half ago, talking about all of the crime issues that we have and what can we do to control access. And at the time, we when we met out with Craig at the site and talked about putting up a PED gate, pedestrian gate with key code access or some kind of turnstile, something to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'control, ingress. Egress, so that we could keep the I can't bend it, but that's really what there are the homeless people and the addicts that come into park states. They have one path that comes through right by my house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I live right next door to that guy and they and I have my church member walking into three times. He stole my bike, jumped over my fence in broad daylight with people home next door to steal my bike.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So these people have no shame. They don't have any threat. They don't they don't look at anything and say this is a bad deal. So we need to regulate access. And I'm not talking about cutting it off and sealing it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My proposal after item of proposal, it would be a hard closure for three months to change habits and then put the PED kid up to replace the hard closure so that everyone that belongs there can get in and then have the police department be in charge of handing out key cards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Criminals are not going to go to the PD to get a keycard and then you can just have them come in and out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Our next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, tyler polson. I am strongly in favor of this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Ruth one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also echo that notion. I'm a Pakistani resident and a mom of two young boys, and they do a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Outdoor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Activities at night. They're big tennis players, and I don't actually feel safe with the amount of suspicious people that I myself have personally witnessed that very much are very disheveled. They look intoxicated. I have called the police myself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've taken pictures of them on my neighbor's property looking into their windows.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's just a very uncomfortable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Feeling that you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cannot be outside at night. So thank.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You. Thank you very much. And last speakers are Will Willie Gaffney, Rebecca Corrie, Margaret Lehnert says Margaret Cohn, who killed Ingrid Nicolay and David Eastman. Please come forward in that order. Willie Gaffney. Rebecca Corrie. Margaret Keough, Ingrid Nicolay and David Eastman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. Thanks for hearing from me. I'm Dr. Willie Gaffney.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'A resident of Park.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Estates. What you guys may not know is that there's now a homeless encampment of sorts down on Atherton, which is just outside of our community. It appears that these some of the homeless people are accessing our neighborhood due to this walk away, and we very much would like to have it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Limited access. I am a neighbor of Dr. Morrell. My home is the one that was actually burglarized that day. A gentleman didn't get in, but I worry because my daughter was at home. She's 21 and she typically will leave our home to walk the dog and won't set the alarm.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can you imagine what would have happened if he had actually gained access and had been inside of our home when she got back from walking the dog? Can you imagine what would have happened if I had been home when he broke the window and put his hand in?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would have responded with lethal force. That's pretty dangerous. Imagine what would have happened if my daughter hadn't alerted the policeman that the two black guys were armed and were two good guys holding a white gentleman who was unarmed on the street.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If they come around the corner and open fire, that that would have been a horrible outcome or could have been a horrible outcome. Now, I strongly encourage you to limit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Access to these bridges.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. If anyone else can, please just come forward and rest the speakers. Please come forward closer. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm Ingrid Nicolai. I've lived in the neighborhood over 30 years. Things have changed. And one thing that bothers me is that there are transients sleeping right down in there where the preschoolers. And whenever I walk through there, I'm thinking, these are kids that are two and three.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't think they're four yet. But these people are walking through and talking to those kids. I don't think that's safe. I I've noticed that they're dropping all sorts of paraphernalia. They don't really. I've asked them to, you know, what are you doing?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They said, it's none of your business. I can be here if you can be here. They're caring. I was upset when I saw driving down the block. Two or three of them who had stolen the tricycles from the preschool and their the bigger utility trikes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I should have stopped them, but I didn't. And I still feel bad about that. But the neighborhood is not safe having that open. They're all going through with bags. They're all riding their bikes. They're all going down the hill, turn in the corner to get out on Atherton.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm all in favor of putting a lock code on that gate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you so much. Next picture, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi, I'm Rebecca Corey. I'm in favor of the game with Ingrid. I've lived in the neighborhood 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we've had.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Nothing but break ins, robberies, packages, mail checks, stolen tags off our car, you name it. It's happened time and time again and I'm in favor of it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi, I'm Margaret Kuo and I also strongly support this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I live.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In on a street that is adjacent to the bridge and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have had packages stolen and have my.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Had my car broken into.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would also.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Emphasize that it's called the bridge, but it's not really.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A bridge. It's a very irregular.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Pathway that is dark and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kind of covered.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Over with trees and hedges. And it is a source of concern and anxiety and worry when it comes to my safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the safety of my son.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for taking the time to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Listen to the residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Requests and to the rest of the Council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would hope that you would support this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Agenda item as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. And David Eastman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. I'm also Resident Park Estates. I have been there for 25 years. For 25 years, I have talked about all the criminals who are coming in through the gate off of Bellflower and over the bridge from from Atherton.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But nobody talks about all the criminals who are coming into the neighborhood on Los Lomas Street, which happens to be where I live. Basically, what we've heard is we've got crime in the neighborhood. Yes, we do less and less than most places in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The the basic idea that those criminals are coming across the bridge is based on no facts whatsoever. We have anecdotal material. I have suggested in the comment section that we do a very extensive statistical study before we either get it or even pass out cards for it.'",

I know I was on the board, I was the treasurer for a number of years and there's quite a bit of money there that if the city thinks it's too much money to'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Sort of what we're looking at. So, Eric, I'm not sure if you're back there, but if you could cue up the photos. Okay. So just to give everyone kind of a overview of where we're at, this is the Park Estates area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you can see the main cross streets that are relevant to this discussion is Atherton. And the red line there, that's where the bridge is located. So I'm just going to go through a few photos here. There's the flood control channel and you can see the yellow delineates where the bridge is currently located or the walkway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is the entry point to the walkway from Atherton. These are a few photos of the walkway that you can see so that you can see what walkway we're talking about here. I believe that Judge Lowenthal is correct, that this was not designed to be in the beginning a walkway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was designed to be an access point for maintenance. However, it has turned into a walkway. And you can kind of see what the ground of it looks like and what the condition is. This is the cul de sac area that the walkway leads to in the Park Estates neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So generally, anyone who's on the street and a vehicle would be someone who's living in that street because it is a cul de sac area. This is the viewpoint of the bridge leading into the bridge from the Park Estates area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And again, another shot of that, and this is the flood control channel. So I'm glad to be discussing this topic tonight with the full city council. For background, this has been a location that countless residents have contacted my office about for the past four or five years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It comes up at community meetings. I actually had one of the residents who spoke tonight came to a concert in the park, and while everyone else was seated outside with their picnic blankets, enjoying the music, he came specifically to talk to me about this bridge.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And after doing so, promptly left to go home because he wanted to make sure he had face to face contact with me. It's been the focus of discussions at so many community meetings and it's an interesting issue because it's very localized to two different neighborhoods, both in the third Council District and actually it affects the fourth Council'",

So with the competing concerns that we have in mind, I've been working all day today to try to figure out a compromise that we can put into play on a pilot basis so that we can have the'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Walking is my absolute favorite hobby and my refuge. If I didn't walk, I wouldn't be sane. And so I understand the need to have the ability to walk and have access to beautiful neighborhoods such as park estates, and be able to have the peace and not be on a major corridor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Limiting access to residents who want to walk in the area is not an issue, and that's not the concern. The concern is the invitation for, as I've shown here, with no lighting, an area where people can seek refuge and have easy access points to residential communities, which I don't think is something that anybody wanted or hoped to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to have. So I'm proposing adding temporarily adding a gate with a pin code that could be used to open the gate. The pin code would be freely given to anyone who emails or calls. In fact, between now and when the gate is installed, we will have a sign out there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm hoping that the residents from both park estates and the apartment complex will help me share with people that there's going to be an access code, because we want to make sure that people who want to use this for walking have the access code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So after that, we'll have a sign at the gate that has the number or email address to contact in order to get the access code. So we'll set that up so that anyone who wants to can have access to it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will it be perfect? Probably not. It's the first time that we've done something like this. So this is an opportunity for us to experiment and see what works and what doesn't. And that's what the six month period will be about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's an it's an attempt to try to compromise. What I am asking from the Park Estates residents is if you see something, say something. You have to contact the police. You have to contact the police when you see something.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because if what you're seeing is not supported in police data in terms of calls for service, then it's not something that the city can rely on to take further action. So we'll be we'll be studying what happens in the next 30 to 45 days before the gate is installed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll also be studying. What happens after that. So I'm asking my colleagues to support me in this item. This is a local neighborhood issue and I ask for your support.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And the best progress long term for you is going to be figuring out how to work privately with them to come up with a long term deal that works. It's just going to affect your day to day better.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just going to be better, I think in the long run. That's just my opinion. We could agree to disagree on that. But what I'm sharing with you is that I have I've pleaded with them to come forward and give you something that is reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am hoping that they do that. And I'm asking you to give it. Honest and meaningful consideration. That's all I'm asking in regards to what we're going to do as a city. What I'd like to do is and I want to ask this, our acting city manager, if this is reasonable, is it reasonable for the city attorney'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and city manager to come back on November 19th? And that's that's less than 30 days. I get that and I apologize for that. But if we do need to take any sort of action before January 1st rent increases, I want us to be able to have some time to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So November 19th would be the target date for city to city staff to come back with some information for us, including how many mobile home parks are in the city, how many residents do we have that are impacted by space rent issues?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What are our legal options? And the the people who spoke on behalf of the mobile home park residents? You're absolutely right. What I have learned in the last week, very different than regular tenant law. It's a whole body of law that people have developed an expertize in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know Mr. Anthony is working on that, but we need to know what our what our options are in terms of mobile home law, how that might align with existing rent stabilization ordinances, both locally and statewide. And what options do we have in terms of timing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that reasonable to come back on November 19th with some options for the city council?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So you're correct. That's not a whole lot of time. But we realize the time sensitivity to this. And so at the council would like to direct that. We would do our very best to come back on the 19th with as much as we know and give you some options.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Oh, excuse me. Councilmember Price, as you know, since this popped up on the supplemental agenda and since the many of the same residents that spoke tonight spoke a week or two ago, we've been off and running. So we have a bit of a head start.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we could get enough information to reasonably inform the council to take a decision with some options by the 19th. That should work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That would be great. And if we need. And just so everybody knows, we put this on the supplemental agenda, which means it went on the agenda Friday as as an item of urgency. So we don't do that very often.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I've done that like twice in five years. So I want you to understand, you know, we're we're we're. No, no, no. Don't, don't. Please, don't. Don't stand up. Don't, don't, please, don't, don't, don't go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so I just want you guys, please. I just this is my job. I'm doing my job. My colleagues are all doing their job. We all care about where you land, but we also want to understand everybody to understand we need some time to figure out what the policy is going to be, because whatever we do for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Belmont Shore is going to apply citywide. And all of my colleagues here have mobile home parks in their districts. So they're going to need to educate themselves. They're going to need to talk to property owners. So, too, the property owners are management company representatives who are here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I to hope and pray that there is a private resolution that comes out of this. Either way, mobile home parks are going to be included in our tenant protection programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Nelson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. So, first of all, I'd like to just commend the residents for for organizing and sounding the alert and getting their city council office and bringing the issue to the entire city council so quickly. Obviously, we want to support and commend the council member for her quick action on this matter as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we first heard of the facts a week ago, I think we were all pretty taken aback by, you know, the claims of 30 plus percent, 35% rent increases, which is nobody can claim can weather that that's that's disruptive to anybody's lifestyle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and again, we we have been as a city council dealing with the issues of renters protections with them in terms of, you know, multifamily housing. But mobile homes have been off of the reservation or I would say just out of the conversation for for the entire time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it just made sense with the actions of the city council recently, the last state legislative actions recently. It just makes sense to include mobile home residents in our city in those protections as well. I will certainly support that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's only fair. Certainly been down this road with a few of our parks over the last few years and some of the outcomes have been, you know, I think favorable for for the park residents, a mobile home park residents in a district where, you know, friendly village.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They they recently had a a class action lawsuit came together just like you all did. Fought back. And, you know, things are happening there. So that said, I just, again, want to commend Suzy Pryce, commend the residents for her, for organizing and understanding that the work that you have done certainly will of have an impact on our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city as a whole. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrus.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. First of all, I want to thank Councilwoman Price for bringing this to our knees to the diocese. I'm even more excited, Mr. Wilks. I don't know what profession you're in, but after have to listen to your comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do know that I'm going to stop for any line. I'm going to follow the law, just like you said. I'm so excited. You know, sometimes you worry about when you get to be a certain age. I'm a senior citizen and I see now when we get tired of being tired, we come out and let you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how we feel about it. And I just want to let you individuals know tonight, you have spoke loud and clear. No one should have to be misplaced. When you talk about 35%, you don't even have to pay that much debt for a down payment on a home.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they're trying to tell you. The collapse is fine, but I'm afraid because being a senior since I want to move into, you know, I just and it doesn't look good for me. But I'm telling you, the way you guys are speaking tonight, I have hope.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I still have hope. And I know what, Mrs. Price, when she gets on, when she gets on something, she won't stop again to you. Something will be done tonight. And I'm told her support and only the sad thing about it, the other individuals talk about rent control.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These young individuals here they are look into and they're listening. If we keep going at this rate, we'll all be homeless. We're going to have to do something. We had to do it. Now, we cannot just keep putting Band-Aids on these situations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to thank you so much, Mrs. Price, for coming out with this on the diocese. And all you individuals come out tonight and speak, especially we are seeing you. We we're in bed at this time. But I just want to thank you guys for coming out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to take a minute and just acknowledge some of those residents from 540 and 550, 64th Street who received those 60 day notices. I'm aware of that, visited that site. I visited those apartments.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know what they look like. I've seen the conditions is deplorable. That's a slum. We need to be more. We need to have more tools to protect people from slumlords. I have to tell you, you know, if it if you know, what I'd love to see is for the city to be able to provide a resource to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'acquire property like that and make it covenant affordable housing because it's actually great positioning is right by Hampton Park. It's a great space. My vision for that space was the city to be to do affordable housing conversions and help stabilize that those two buildings and continue to provide affordable housing in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But in order for that to happen, we're going to need a willing property owner. We're going to need a dedicated source of local revenue to make those things happen. There's a lot that a lot of schools we still don't have that we want to have in order to provide what we need, which is great affordable housing, that's'",
        "'speaker_10': 'quality that that provides dignity. So my commitment to use I'm going to continue to work on this. I'm going to meet with you, you all your group. And and we're going to see whatever, whatever resolution we can provide.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know that what we did most recently with our tenant protections law does add some additional support. But I know how shocking and jarring it could be to receive a 60 day notice. You know, I did not grow up a homeowner.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I grew up a renter. You know, I attended 13 public schools across five states. I know what it's like to move to get to be housing and stable. So so I understand. And we'll be we're going to continue talking in terms of in terms of this motion, I think it makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilwoman Price, you know, I wasn't here last week. I heard about it. Thank you for moving so quickly on this. I think I think it makes sense. I have a number of mobile home parks within my district, both Villa Park and over on Long Beach Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have another Westland site. So I'm going to engage with those communities to get some input. I'm going to you know, I've had we've had conversations internally. I've had conversation with the mayor and others over the course of the last year or so about what's the appropriate approach to mobile homes, given there are a whole separate section'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of code, a whole separate section of state law that governs it and it doesn't mesh as easily in one ordinance. So I think we do need to take our time and figure out what the best approach is, and we need to conduct some outreach to stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think there is a there's no reason, you know, you've heard I've heard the stories. I've heard great job at public comment. 35% is is way too high for anyone. And we're hearing stories like this all over the place.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So you have my support and I look forward to to what what comes of this. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I thank you and thank you to everyone that came out so often. When we hear some of these stories about rent increases or people being evicted, it's really challenging for some of those communities to make it here. So I really appreciate you guys really being involved in making sure that all of us understand the urgency.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Same thing my councilmember said 35% is absolutely insane. I've been a lifelong renter myself. Obviously, I have grandparents and they are on fixed incomes and understanding what would happen to my grandmother if she received a notice like this and she doesn't live near me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I can understand each of you have a personal story, in effect, that this would have the comment that an issue like this should be handled privately. I think that we have historically seen, and particularly in the state of California, that when it comes to housing or land use, it's never best to be left to the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'private sector to try to figure that out. We know that there's a dynamic in power that that is difficult. And so I hear you and I think my counsel calling for bringing this quickly, sometimes with issues that are this complex, we kind of we bring our hands over how to do it just the right way, and we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'just got to put it on the agenda. So I applaud that. I'd like to ask the city attorney, I know it's only been a couple of days, but just it was my understanding when we began the the reload conversation that mobile homes had to be left out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I understand that maybe that's just because they're owned. You know, the building is owned by the person that habitat, but that the land is not. But can you tell us could something like including this in a reload policy be done like from your cursory look, I know that you're coming back with research.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think it could. But thank you for asking the question, because actually I'm going to well, that's the short answer, but I'd like to take an opportunity to maybe clarify, clarify, maybe some potential miscommunication or misunderstandings on my part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The several members of the public and some council members behind the dais have mentioned the tenant relocation program that the Council adopted applicable to residential properties in May, effective on August 1st. In fact, it's mentioned in the council letter that was put together, which I think was somewhat hastily put together because Councilmember Price was trying to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'reactive as quickly as possible to constituent concerns. But I think what I'm hearing from almost every member of the public and from everyone behind the dais is really what you want. Staff and myself to research is is not so much bringing mobile homes under the umbrella of the tenant relocation ordinance, but rather bringing you all back options'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to apply a rent stabilization ordinance, which is more protective. But at the risk of upsetting people, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what that's what I think the direction I'm going to take back with staff and we're going to come back with options.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'More along those lines on November 19th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A component of that could be relocation, could not be depending on what direction we get from y'all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for that for that clarification. I know this is Councilmember Price's item, but since it was an answer to my question, I think what I've my quick look looks like there's about 101 cities in California that have mobile home stabilization policies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so being that this has moved fast, I guess understanding the difference in between that and how a relocation policy might effect or be added to a mobile home stabilization policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can certainly speak to that when we come back on the 19th. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also I mean, I recognize I have a mobile home in my district that's also in pediatrics. So we just voted earlier on a visioning for pediatrics and I would imagine would be an area that that land value is going to go through the roof as we finalize this process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So definitely support protecting our mobile homeowners as much as possible. Thank you guys very much. I look forward to the presentation next week. Oh, I did have one thing. Could you also include in your presentation if it's if it's doable, the vacancy rate of our mobile home parks?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because my question is, if we had 340 mobile home residents that had their land increased by 35%, is there somewhere for them to go in the city? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can try and that vacancy rate data is really difficult to come by. So we will do our best to answer the question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can have a staff call around each of them and ask how many?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Constantly, Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not going to speak a lot on this, but I do have a mobile home park in my district as well when we're villages. And I think that everything that has come forward at this point, thank you for the clarification in regards to what is going to be included in the study, because I think it's very important'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for everyone to know. And I hope that when you're doing the outreach, you also reach out to the other mobile home parks in the city as well. That's very important. They need to be made aware. If they're not experiencing some kind of increased rate now, they probably will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we need to have that in place so that we can protect them as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I know we're going to everyone has a chance to speak. We do have a motion on the floor. I'm going to ask you a few comments and then we'll go to the vote. I just want to just first reiterate my support for this process and the motion in front of the council tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've had multiple conversations with Councilwoman Pryce, and she's been great about keeping me and my team up to speed on what the issues are. And a lot of you have reached out as well. And I really, really do just really feel for the situation that you're in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know I said it last time you were here, but nobody should have to face a 35% rent increase, especially not a senior on a fixed income. And so I think what's what you're all going through, we all are here to to help to help this process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I agree that there are there are multiple options, I think, in front of the council. I am I am glad that they're going to be coming back quickly so we can have a broader conversation about what is possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to see and I think it's possible for this council to support a policy that that is fair and reasonable, that would support not just you, but all of our mobile home parks across the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you think about what is happening with the statewide, some folks mentioned Governor Newsom and and the statewide bill, I believe. I mean, that bill, as we know, exempts in many cases or in most cases mobile homes. We know that the tenant relocation program that I supported and folks supported here that was in front of this council'",
        "'speaker_1': 'did not include mobile home parks either. And so clearly, that is a gap. Any, any, any and something that I think should be addressed by by this body. Let me also just say that I'm I'm I do support this approach because I think Mr..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Anthony you'll be able to to give us and give the body some some input as to whether this really is a a new program that is that is based on stabilization of of rents around mobile home parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If this is some type of of companion legislation to the tenant relocation ordinance and what that actually could look like. And so I am hopeful and looking forward to seeing those different options that you bring in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will say more broadly, there is a lot of changing law on this in this topic that is in this area that is happening very quickly, not just what the state is doing, but how what the state has done also affects the city's tenant relocation ordinance and how what we do needs to align with the state as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well. And so those are all discussions that are going to be happening over the next few weeks and months ahead. And and just please note that we will be monitoring this closely. And I just really want to thank you all for coming out and making us aware of this huge challenge in front of us.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And that handoff, I think I'll have to agree, was a great resource. I think she handled this beautifully. So thank you. I do have a question about the item that we're about to vote on. To Mr. Anthony. If I understood you correctly, you would would you say that it's more than likely this will be a stand alone'",
        "'speaker_10': 'ordinance? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is that where we're going?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't want to put words in the council's Matthew. Matthew, the policy makers. But yes, that would be that's what I'm hearing y'all say. A tenant relocation ordinance applicable to mobile.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Homeowners would not restrict.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rent increases. And just about everyone has spoken about the need to restrict rent increases. That would be pursuant to a rent stabilization ordinance. Like many, many members of the public and councilmembers have have spoken about, there's over 100 jurisdictions in California that have mobile home rent stabilization ordinances applicable only to mobile homes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we would not be treading new water in that regard. And I would expect most of the options we bring back will be.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Along those lines. Okay. So the point of clarification is we're not looking at the wording we have on the agenda. I know we're looking at what you just stated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's right. Okay. Thank you for that. Yeah, right. Thanks.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'a unity behind rent rent increases, but just to get to know each other and be a part of that, it's an amazing thing. I've gotten to know a few of you and I'm just so thankful for having had the opportunity, and I hope you guys are over each other as well, so some good things can come of'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I just wanted to clarify one last thing in regards to my intent for this item. The intent look, the tenant relocation program, our ordinance that we passed here really doesn't apply to a lot of the issues that the mobile home park owners have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, 30 $500 or 40 $500 isn't going to do anything for them for relocation. My goal was to help them with the rent increases. So if we have an ordinance that we pass in the future that protects them from rent increases, I think it's only fair when the city is protecting other tenants from rent increases and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the state is now protecting tenants from rent increases. So my goal is for us to have some options in terms of rent stabilization because the relocation aspects of our ordinance really don't apply to our mobile home park. So that was I mean, you're right that I put something together just to get it on the agenda, but at'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the time I did not know how different these two needs are and how mobile home law has its own very, very established set of laws.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's perfect. Thank you. That makes me feel better about the way I characterized the direction that we'll take back. And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one one last thing also. Mr.. Mr.. Parking. Mr.. Anthony, I do think when we bring this issue back, I also just want to make sure, obviously, because I think Councilman Price is right here. Obviously, the state has enacted and the governor has signed a series of of protections, rent caps, just cause in a variety of different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'protections for renters and tenants. And I just also think it's important that as we discuss this stabilization ordinance, which is certainly, I think different, that we look at the broader picture of all of our tenants across the city of Long Beach and just make sure that we are that if that the state is providing that level of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'protection for everyone and that we fill in gaps when appropriate. So I look forward to that, that discussion as well. And so with that, we have a motion and a second source. Please go ahead and cast their votes.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'that per the item through the city clerk 48 hours prior to the child care services that we have lined up actually carry the insurance required by risk management. It is child care. And so you could bring your child regardless of age?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, not regardless of age from 2 to 13. So if your child is two years old, up to 13, you would be able to bring them here during business hours. I mean, not business hours during a meeting in this chamber to have child watch, we have a secure location that our city manager has worked to make sure'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we have a site that is appropriate. And I think that answers your questions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I get $3,000, but child care is expensive. So would the person who's dropping off the child also pay like a a deposit or a. It would be completely free.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's completely free to the public and to our city employees that need it during those hours.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you use the word child care, but. Would it be? Because I think child care, at least again, it's been a long time since I worked in child care, but I did work in child care. There's like age separations by group, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when you have child care at a facility like something like this, that is it's done in public meetings in other places. Very often it is it's not that complicated. They bring a couple of different people. They are licensed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They have the insurance that they need and it's based on request. So if you have a request for two people, for two kids, then you have one staff person. If there's another request, there's another staff person. We're allocating $3,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If that money runs out ahead of time, that is the time that will bring it back to this council to discuss. We've allocated this based on the number of of hours that we think there will be requests and added an additional amount to cover on top of that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And so the the caretakers would be licensed, but we're not trying to license a site on a child care facility onsite.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not at this time. But I would love to see that in the middle of this. But in between the library and here, when the middle part gets developed, I think that having a child care facility there that would be accessible to city employees would be absolutely something that we should strive towards.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I ask a lot of these questions because I've recently researched a little bit around being a county employee and having child care available to employees in that model. It is a licensed site and it is available to employees, but it also is available to the public and there's some preferential variances.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then there's also a recommended donation that allows the program to sustain itself over time for a longer period of time. And so I was just kind of trying to better understand. Especially coming from a budget perspective. $3,000 is a great donation to get it started.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just recognize that depending on the criteria that we start the pilot that visioning might have been on on a go forward basis. So the pilot you're hoping for lasts through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How many months?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a 12 month pilot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, $3,000 for 12 months. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't want to go back and forth. I can reread the item for you if you like.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Respectfully, I have the opportunity to ask questions. I didn't appreciate that a lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You ask all your questions and then I'll queue up again to answer them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so I'm here back. Let me let me just make sure we're where we're at. Did the motion get read in the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We haven't had any public comment yet, but the moment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilmember Turanga ah you did second. Okay. Let me do the public comment. Okay. And then we'll come back and this order, Larry Goodhue, Stefan Burson, Suelo, Maricela de Rivera, Lily Ocampo and Carmen de Marzo. Please come forward in that order.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very good to hear the suggestions before. You are certainly good. I'm going to suggest this also. It's sitting, examining. Hiring someone trained in mental care to help guide some of our more problematic council members. I think that would benefit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fact, if we had that long ago, we wouldn't have the problems that we have now. So if you're going to do this, let's go all the way and get some mental help for. Particularly the councilperson from the second district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And. Also. I'll hold it at that for the time. Well, with the exception also, of course, of the mayor. You know, he's facing the prison sentence he's going to be facing. He's going to need some mental health. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Also, Madam Clerk, I know we have over ten speakers who goes down to thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Stephanie. Awesome. So Democratic Socialists of America, Long Beach branch coming here in support of the strong support of this item. This is an issue of an excess of accessibility and public access to that. You had two public meetings.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe $3,000 is the least amount of money that you could possibly delegate to this, especially given the importance of making sure that families were represented at these meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We here at our organization, we prepared childcare at every single meeting because we believed that having our children there is accessible and required part of making sure the democratic process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Whatever is necessary to make sure that this goes through. I think that you should be pursuing this because this is a basic issue of small business, small D democracy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you and have a good day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Marcella Rivera.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'A council member Turanga and my council.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'For my wild.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Non whispering children. I think it's really important that all people in our society are welcomed and included and whether that is very young children, very old people, people with different abilities, physical, cognitive and different languages. Just everything that I've seen today in this meeting is why I love Long Beach and I'm really excited about this program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know that running a group that hovers around a thousand local Long Beach women breastfeeding and raising children in the city, I can say that civic engagement is something that everybody's really interested in and this is going to help.'",

However, city meetings are often inaccessible, especially because children get restless after waiting for so long. I've personally brought my two grandchildren with me to these meetings and have experienced what it is like for them to get restless and tired.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we were happy to hear that the city has taken into account the many barriers parents and caregivers face when trying to advocate for their families and looking into providing child care.

        "'speaker_5': 'soccer games. And so when we talk about the work that we do in organizing, everything is centered on families. Everything is centered on the ability to bring the most vulnerable families that are struggling, complex situations, to bring truth and power to their stories.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But they are unable to do that because we lack affordable childcare and accessible childcare and meetings like these. Right. It is important that if we center families in our policies, we also center them in the actions that we take on a daily basis, like meetings like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. And so I really applaud the fact that we're taking on consideration starting a pilot program. Thank you, Janine, for the money. It shows a lot of pretty much proactive ness from your district and from yourself. And so I would encourage that from everybody else.'",

So I'm trying to raise my two daughters and also trying to be civically involved in some of the decisions is being made that affects us.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Say, example, like in the city council, we need a childcare service provider for the woman that family that attend city council meetings. Because I work in the community, I often seen moms and families that they are pressing about the issues and they want to attend the city council, city council to address the issues, but they cannot be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'here. So working in the community, I often hear a lot of story and also lack of childcare. Service provider to a woman who just having children and want to go back to work of woman who are on public service and want to go back to work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this very important not just for the city council meeting and also for across the board, across the city in any meeting so that the city can provide childcare. Please. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much, Councilman Austin. Actually, Councilman, let me let me go back to Councilwoman Mongo because she had the floor when we went to public comment. So, Councilman Monroe.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. A couple of things. I'm a huge supporter of childcare. I actually worked in childcare. I want to take a first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Moment to think.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But fell out of language. Breastfeeds. I'm a member of Lemmy's Breastfeeds. I read the stories sometimes at 3:00 in the morning when I'm breastfeeding. I'm also a pumping mom, so I often leave from here and go in the back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to thank acting city manager Mr. Modica, who, when we moved into the new building, quickly recognized there wasn't a breastfeeding option on this floor and made one available to me in the back immediately. And so I really want to appreciate that childcare is important.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The logistics of what we talk about and what we decide to go forward with is also very important. I heard a couple of comments related to. Low income families. We have lots of resources available. And if the the child care provided is child care, not child watch, there's funding available.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the types of questions that I'm asking aren't to be critical of the program, but more from my background and experience in working in licensed child care, starting a licensed child care site from nothing, and working through the CHC and again and all the different programs that are available, I think it's important that we be sure'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to leverage as much funding as is possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To keep a program like.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This going on an ongoing basis because $3,000 couldn't run my sight for a month. And so I recognize that this is just at night and that's great, but I see a bigger long term. I know that when we were building the Civic Center, I was approached by a couple of different licensed childcare facilities and asked what the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'vision was, was their space set aside and all of those things, what rent would look like, and those aren't within our purview. We handed that off to economic development. But as a mom and as a daughter of a single mother, I've been to a many, many meetings like this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that child care is important, but we just have to make sure that we're using the right words and creating the correct expectation, because what I also am concerned about is the expectation that $3,000 is going to go very far.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that it's also important for us as a council to look at ways for you to engage and be a part of the meeting very actively without sitting here for 5 hours. And so we need to think about that, too, whether it's Facebook Live or we have public comment, you can submit in advance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what does that look like and is it engaging? Because oftentimes it's not. And so I think it's a whole a whole picture. So I'm supportive of this item and I look forward to hearing more about it. But I also recognize that.'",
        "'speaker_9': '$3,000 might not go very far. And we need to think long term about what our options are in partnering. And so I'd be really interested in partnering with a licensed childcare organization or your child watch program like they have in a lot of our fitness facilities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But but also recognizing that there are programs that will pay for part of it. And so if there is a quote unquote fee for service, there are agencies and entities that will pay for that for them. And so to make sure we know what that is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Austin. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I appreciate the public comment. I think I also appreciate the the impetus of this item. And, you know, many of you may or may not know my my wife was a staffer here at City Hall for many years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my kids literally grew up in the old city hall in the back or in the offices while while she was working and I was working. And so the for for city employees, but also for folks going to public to participate, child care is always a consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do agree that the $3,000 is a is generous from the second council district with priority budget. But at the same time I think it's grossly underestimating the cost of what this world will will be. And this is a pilot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we certainly hope that, you know, we will learn throughout the process. I'm supportive of the item and will support it because I think it merits at least a study to look at the possibilities. But. In my my day job.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also have the opportunity to to work with a licensing program, analysts who who license child care facilities, who inspect child care facilities on a daily basis. These individuals are in and out of homes of providers. And it's not just the provider that it needs to be licensed is the facility that needs to be licensed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so certainly I expect city management to do their due diligence right and contact the appropriate state agencies and get the right licenses to do this, because it's not as easy as just, hey, you know, there's a room and, you know, and a babysitter to go watch your children.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are liabilities that come with that. And the facility has to be completely up to code four four to protect the safety, obviously, of the kids. And then the the other piece of it is also, do we have any ideal and I'm certainly I'm sure that we don't have of how many.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Children or what will be the capacity of such a program? You know, this could it could be three kids. It could be 50 kids. And I think those numbers really make a difference with the licensing agency. So just my thoughts, I'll support this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's a it's innovative. It's something that, you know, as I see a few children out in the audience today, it will bring more relief to parents who are engaged in the city process. But it does have, I think, some challenges that we need to get some answers to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'd like to call on Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you. So perhaps me talking while there are about 50 people leaving the room made it a little distracting in the beginning. So let me clarify some of the questions for folks. The $3,000 was based on many conversations with the Los Angeles Education Partnership Group that works with Long Beach Forward and often provides child care services'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to many of those that are in the audience today. That was based on an estimate of 10 hours a month. Now we know that there might be months that we go over. We also know there are months that we never use child care.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it was based on 10 hours a month. And it is done as a pilot with the idea that we are going to ask them to make sure they share with us all the signs and information. And we've identified the areas that we would like them to to track so that we can say this is what'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a real program would look like, and that if we get an assessment, you know, that that $3,000 has been used in six months or we're getting a a flag of that, then we can make some adjustments and we can bring something sooner to the council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While this item is just for providing child care during meetings in this chamber, obviously I think all of us would love to see some child care facilities closer in downtown. We've only really had one down here. Most of us have kids and know how expensive that is and that none of those are open at night.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so this is just a quick item to get the ball rolling so that we can start doing that work. There's a lot more work that we can do to make sure families are involved in council meetings. And absolutely, I know many of you guys watch at home, but there are some items like whether it's it's reflow'",
        "'speaker_7': 'or something like that. You want to be here and you want to be present, but know that this item we did work on, we do have a group that's going to provide that. It's not required to go to an RFP because it's only 3000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That way we could get a pilot program up and running quickly. And again, we did have many conversations with city staff as well as a Los Angeles Education Partnership Group. So I think that that answers those questions. I do want to also point out it is child care.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I thought also it would be child watch based on the group and the certifications that they have. It is child care. They do bring everything that they need to the city to be able to entertain those kids and engage them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm so sorry that I didn't do a PowerPoint or make it more clear in the beginning, but I'm really excited about this program. I'm excited to put forward some of those funds for this. And Mr. Good, you I never respond to you, but my mental health is tiptop because I have great health insurance here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I, I go see my therapist every two weeks on Saturday morning. So thank you for your care and consideration every single meeting. Really appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I want to just comment in support of this item. You know, child care, child watch, whatever it is, it's expensive. I represent a district among the youngest districts in the city, and it's working families, people, they go to work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They want to be engaged in their city, in their in their government, in the decisions that impact their their lives. As we're here making decisions that then do impact their lives. And we have to think about the barriers that keeps people from being engaged in the decision making process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's unfortunate that we have to think about children as as as a barrier. But the reality is, you know, babysitters you know, babysitters are expensive and you don't trust, you know, everyone with your children. I don't. We don't.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, not everyone has grandparents, things like that to count on. So if it's important to us as a city that folks have an opportunity to come down, if an issue truly is important to them that we have that service to offer, I think we have to go through the process of exploring it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, I agree 3000 is this is certainly going to cost more, but I don't want to sneeze at the fact that a councilperson said, look, you know, we're we're coming up with 3000 as a start. If we find out this costs more, we want to explore what that looks like.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I acknowledge that. Councilwoman, I appreciate you offering $3,000 of your one time district priority funds for this issue. I've seen we've done that on Kiva. We've done a number different programs is an important program. And I'd like to know if if the pilot requires more money so that we can we can talk about that in general'",
        "'speaker_10': '. Again, child care is incredibly expensive in general. And I think it's just sort of a standard that we need to we need to begin to think about providing as we as we engage with the public. This is just the cost ultimately of cost of doing business.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't know that it needs to happen at every council meeting we may need to look at. Sometimes we you can it might be a by request kind of situation. We've done that with language access and other things.'",

You know, that may be a few years out. That might make it a bit easier if there's a facility on site that maybe we can contract on Tuesdays to stay open.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But in the meantime, I think this is something that we can figure out. It's completely doable. I'm optimistic about this and staff and I want to see you be creative and figure out a way to make this happen.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So we need to understand the insurance. We need to understand whether this was child care versus child watch. We obviously want somebody a qualified and be licensed. The group that was identified is one that we are becoming familiar with that that they do some of this programing.'",

I want to see the pilot kind of get there. But I was going to say, don't we have public agencies that do this within the city?'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Yeah, I just think it would be good if there's already something working that we can deploy here, figure out some economies of scale or cost savings to make it happen. I think it's probably the best, best way to go about it.'",

So the My Brother's Keeper initiative was launched in 2014 to address opportunity gaps faced by young males of color and with the support of the Long Beach Department of Health'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and Human Services. Youth from Voice Waves and Youth Leadership Institute created a survey and a short form documentary to highlight how these issues exist today on the local level. And so we started this process in February and finished it up in June.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And throughout the process, we also recorded a podcast featuring a discussion about preventing youth from getting involved with the justice system. This featured community experts such as members of Black Lives Matter. And like our documentary, this can be found on the voiceless website.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Voice leads dot org, not dot.com. So our survey, we received a total of 197 responses from youth in Long Beach, and the survey was crafted by the youth involved in the My Brother's Keeper project under the Supervision of Wildlife staff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Our goal with the survey was learn more about the mental health needs of youth both before and during their involvement with the justice system. And as you can see above, a lot of our youth that were surveyed reported being between the ages of 14 and 18.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some were older than that. And they also reported mostly not having a job or being part time workers. And being on free and reduced lunch. Questions about. Give me a second. So questions about gender and about race are both left open ended.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As you can see, gender there was a pretty even split with people identifying as male and female, almost 5050. And then with race, the majority of our responders were Hispanic or Latino. But I think there's a pretty good mix that represents the diversity of our city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Most of the world, not most say a lot of the youth. Have had their lives impacted by the criminal justice system. Either they themselves have been involved personally or they know someone who has a lot of their involvement involved, having been interacting with school officials or law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we. Sorry about that. Among one of the most startling findings that we got from the survey is that 63% of the youth participants had experienced what they described as extreme stress or trauma in some frequency, with 31% of those youths saying that they experiencing it daily or weekly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And survey participants were also asked to describe how they cope with trauma and other negative emotions. On the screen, you'll see the most popular responses to that question. And for the rest of the presentation, I'm going to turn it over to Michael.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Cool. Thanks, Carlos. So just to reiterate what Carlos was saying, it's clear that some youth in Long Beach, many youth, too many youth face a high frequency of trauma and intense stress in their weekly or daily lives. That's self-reported by the youth and lobbyist themselves.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So given the stress, given the negative life events that occur in their lives, we have to ask the question like, where should youth go to find that release? And so the five most common coping mechanisms that youth reported.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Number one was sleep. Number two was talking to friends. And the third most common coping mechanism was creative arts and music. If we notice actually as we engage in this conversation, we're going to realize how important it is to talk to your friends, that this idea of talking, this idea of socialization among young people is really important'",
        "'speaker_6': ', especially when we talk about how young people cope with negative, negative emotions such as anger, sadness, anxiety or stress in their lives. So talking to friends is going to be an important factor for the following reasons. A separate question asked youth of all these different coping mechanisms that you rely on, which coping mechanism do you believe is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the most effective? So by and large, you said that talking is the most effective way to deal with stress and trauma. Here's the problem, though. Only 17% of you said that they could talk to their parents or family about their negative emotions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are negative life events or traumas. Only 9% said they could talk to a trusted community member. What about talking to a teacher or counselor? Only 2% of youth said they could do that. 2% out of 197 students.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Young people are youth in Long Beach. We talked about what coping methods are most common and which are most effective in reducing stress and trauma. Now we're talking about frequency. Well, talk is important. So how often do youth get to actually talk about their emotions to other people?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Unfortunately, we did have to find that one in three youth never talked to anyone about their emotions. Excuse me 1/2. Another 25%. Express themselves to others only every few months. Or a few times a year. Adding on to that, there's a lot of youth who say that there's not many places for them to go for help.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not many people to rely on for support. Given the issues, we actually didn't want one to just rely on like the trauma or focus on that, focus on the problems. We also wanted to focus on solutions. So these are some youth led solutions that the respondents came up with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We asked them, you know, on a scale from 1 to 4, what do you feel are the most effective resources in preventing youth from becoming justice involved? Number one, by far, having a supportive family. Number two athletics. Number three, access to jobs for youth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Number four, music, art and creative media programs. And there's a few other factors up there. That's the top ten, top ten ways that these respondents feel they could be prevented from getting involved in the justice system. The least effective methods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Youth probation. Youth prisons in school detention. Again, focusing on solutions, focusing on the future of limited youth. We thought it was important to come up with three recommendations given this important data that we came across. Increasing restorative justice resources and program visibility across Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What this what this does, it shifts our solutions, our way of thinking from punitive to conversations, which you said themselves. Conversations and talking is the key to healing is the key to prevention. And we also to a turn youth that are disengaged, that maybe don't find many resources across their community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They become engaged in the community by via restorative justice, via community programs. Recommendation number two, increasing mental health opportunities in schools for both students and their families. Because we saw such a low rate of students being able to talk to their families about their negative emotions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We think it's important to do family counseling in schools.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have just about 50 seconds left just on the timer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. Got you. What this does is shift silence youth from silence to conversation. And recommendation number three, we recommend supporting policy efforts at the local level, at local level that dismantle the school to prison pipeline that shifts our policies from punitive to preventative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For the sake of time. We could we could skip this. But if anyone is interested in a trilingual documentary featuring Long Beach youth and experts on these very issues, go to Tony. You are welcome. Youth Justice Doc.

        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks. I just wanted to just chime in and thank you both for coming out with the presentation. Look forward to talking with you and taking a deeper dove here. You know, you your organization and organizations like yours were the ones who were lifting up and talking about this work well before My Brother's Keeper.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My Brother's Keeper came because there was a lot of focus from the White House, from the top that said, hey, we want to focus on this population. And now the leadership of the White House has changed. The national dialog has completely changed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we're getting back to a lot of the rhetoric and the context that was had that happened prior to then. And what do we see? We see the same organizations that were here before carrying this message are the ones who are here now carrying this message.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I think it's important that while sort of our national discourse has changed, we continue to support the local organizations who are continuing to change the narratives around the circumstances and the lives of people who who, you know, boys and young men of color.'",
