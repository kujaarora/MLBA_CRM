        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So Councilwoman Gonzales and I were trying to figure out how long it's been. And I know this council's accustomed to hearing me say that I've worked on something for five years or six years. I think this one takes the cake.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this moment has been 15 years in the making, more than 15 years in the making. Long before I joined the council, I was a resident in downtown at around 2000, and I recall initial conversations between artists and residents who envisioned an innovative visual arts center in downtown Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are a lot of members of the downtown community that have at one time or another participated in the art exchange effort, whether it was for the entire 15 years, some of us, certainly for the entire 15 years and others have come in at critical times and helped move us forward.'",

But definitely the entire time we've worked together as a city. I know how important owning your building is for fundraising for all of the other aspects that provide legitimacy to the work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that you do. And that point has never been lost on me. As for the acres of the books building, acres of books building, I'm very pleased to have a premier local development team in J.R. vendors working on its restoration and adaptive use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know they're here today. Most of you are familiar with John's incredible work around town with the Ebell Club on Third Street, the art theater on Fourth Street, and most recently, the American Hotel or the Psychic Hotel, as some of us know it on Broadway, the new home of Inter Trent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have high hopes for adaptive reuse of acres of books. I understand that some community members are still disappointed with the city for taking a beloved independent bookstore away. And I understand that. And I think those are decisions that were made at a time and those that certainly we're not here to challenge today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I do acknowledge that there is some disappointment. But with that always comes something sweet as well. It certainly. It didn't help that we had to go through a historic recession to reach this point. I think we are all aware of the impact that that has had on many projects and certainly had an impact here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I will say this, Phil and Jacqui Smith, who were owners of the property, were able to walk away and start their own life, their own new life, and have a new lease on life, a retirement package that might never have come had they stayed.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'juices, the redesign of City Place and soon to be finished Edison Lofts with Reykjavik Properties. And I know Mr. Activity is here today as well. Something to be said about connecting the East Village and the downtown core. When the old mall before City Place was here, I think it was called the Long Beach Mall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, yes. Long Beach Mall. It divided the downtown. It separated the East Village from the downtown. And something that we all who live there, work there, love the heart of the downtown wanted to see more than anything was to open that up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the fact that City Place did that in some way by opening up Fourth Street and Fifth Street, it helped. But I think this project will help even more to reconnect, to stitch the East Village to its proper downtown location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we also have Cliff I mentioned earlier, Cliff and John are here and they're behind this project as well. So we couldn't ask for a better group of folks working on this block. I'm very pleased, Mr. Mayor, to move this item for approval.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, I am really happy to see that we will continue to, you know, the progress that we are doing in the downtown area. But before I really vote in this area, I want to make sure that we are hiring Long Beach residents for any demo or construction as promised by the developers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I like to, you know, have a status report on how many jobs we are creating and how many that were filled by the Long Beach residents. If that would be okay.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And that's something that I think we don't talk about very much because maybe it's more commonplace here than in other cities. But I want to celebrate that and I want to be sure that we do celebrate that, that this is a local project by local community members so that they can continue to live and work in the'",

And I had this same trip, the same problems with the disposal of earlier properties that were rattled off rather quickly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would rather see. And I think it makes sense. To have the properties put up for sale. To the highest bidder that shows up at the courthouse step with a cashier's check period. I think that's the way to go.'",
