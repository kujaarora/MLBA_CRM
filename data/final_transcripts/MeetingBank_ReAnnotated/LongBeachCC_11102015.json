        "'speaker_4': 'Last year we had well over 1000 participants from throughout Southern California attend and learn about college opportunities at historically black colleges and universities across the nation, as well as Cal State, Long Beach and Long Beach City College. I see this as one more piece in Long Beach as efforts to ensure the college promise and an opportunity there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to expose many students to some outstanding institutions of higher learning. I would especially like to thank Pacific Gateway Workforce Investment Network for their partnership once again to make this event possible.

        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to introduce Nicole Ford of stepping in right in the right direction. Who is driving? Who is the really the driving force behind this event? And she is quite a spark plug. And she she's and you're here to tell us a little bit about the event.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nicole Yes. Thank you so much for having me tonight. I'm really excited about the second annual Long Beach Black College Fair. Last year was my first opportunity to really get into Long Beach and be part of the community, and I actually love it out here.'",

We had over 60 historically black colleges and universities present as well as we had about 20 organizational resources that were there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This year, we're going to have even more schools, more resources, as well as we're going to make sure that we also have workshops that are going to be provided in the science, technology, engineering and math programs, which is a really big thing right now in most of our high school students going into college because they give lots'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to thank again the city of Long Beach City Councilman Al Austin for really believing in this program and supporting me and my vision and helping a lot of our minority students go to college into higher education, because without higher education, what are they going to really be doing?'",

I work at Long Beach City College and the outreach and recruitment department, but particularly the visor of deaf, which stands for developing African-American professionals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is very important for our students to recognize the resources that they have at Long Beach City College, at Cal State, Long Beach, and also have the opportunity to have HBCUs right here in Long Beach for them to see all the different opportunities that they have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm thankful that Councilman Austin for bringing this in the second year city of Long Beach and to Nicole Fort.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And not only do we have these wonderful organizations and many other community partners, I wouldn't be remiss if I did not give a shout out to my fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, who will be in the house, as well as Rex Richardson and many other elected officials who will be joining us, as well as support of this event'",

        "'speaker_3': 'But I just want to say to and I think they're leaving, but I want to say to the the guests there, you know, it may not look like it now, but maybe 60 ago I was stepping stepping in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I only do it now to entertain my my ten month old daughter. But but likewise, I'm a partner to Councilmember Alston, so let me know whatever support you might need. Moving on. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Gonzales.'",

It's obviously our future. And I want to thank him and everybody who's going to be who's helping him in putting this together, that it's a wonderful event.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm looking forward to it. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'This was the second item. There was a request for Mr. West. We can do a short presentations and get to the motion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Presentation by our public works.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Director Arthur Malloy, and our city engineer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sean Crombie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Honorable mayor, honorable council members. The item before you is an approval for for a contract so the city can enter into a contract with Ford E C Inc. for construction of the forest wetlands restoration. The project is too big to be done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Consist primarily of ecological restoration of approximately 39 acres of detention and storage base and along the east side of Los Angeles River, between the Alamo Boulevard and Osgoode Street. The basin is owned and operated by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Specifically, construction will consist in the removal of excess material resulting from grading modification, improvement of storm drain hydraulics through sediment removal and regrading of the lawful channel wetlands creation. Grading of the floodplain where feasible with habitat enhancements, construction of instream structures for grade control and habitat, including step pools and water control.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are structures removal of non-native vegetation, creation of the vernal pools, including grading and installation of pond liner, procurement of stock plants and maintenance for planting with native species, planting of native species, hydro seeding and hand seeding design and installation of an irrigation system and soil testing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The total construction cost is approximately $4,872,000. We are requesting a 20% contingency for unforeseen conditions conditions of 974,000, totaling an in 5,000,848 $47,000. The construction will take place between January 2016 and probably will end end of September of 2017.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This concludes my comments, and we're here to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There is a there's a motion and a second for this item. Councilman Austin is making the motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I move in support of this motion. I'm excited about this project because it has been a long time coming. The forest wetlands will be a transformation of nearly two of a two mile stretch in North Long Beach from encompassing a number of neighborhoods the Sutter Nature neighborhood, the Virginia Village area up to the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Forest Park. We're adding 39 acres of open space along the L.A. River to provide passive recreation, including walking, biking and equestrian trails. We'll also be creating habitats for numerous wildlife species, as well as recharging groundwater supplies like the Dominguez Gap wetlands that are south of the Alamo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The forest well as will become a destination for nearby residents, as well as nature lovers, tourists and anyone looking for a great place to take a stroll and enjoy a little bit of our our nature in our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From dilemma up to Long Beach Boulevard, the overpass there. There will be a variety of habitat types, including vernal pools, native grasslands, coastal scrub, oak, sycamore and woodlands. There will also be a bicycle staging area beneath the L.A. I'm sorry, the Long Beach overpass to connect the wetlands with the L.A. River bikeway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm really looking forward to getting this project underway. But just one question. Mr. Malloy in it says that the project will be completed by September 2017. Is there any way we can get this done any sooner? This is a very large project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we can entice the contractor to finish the project sooner, we will do that. But it takes time to do the lot of grading and a lot of structures have to be constructed. So I would think that it's a reasonable time period for a 39 acre project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I for one, I can say that I think I've had monthly briefings with public works as well as Parks, Recreation and Marines on this particular item. Since I was elected three and a half years ago and watching the progress to finally get to this point is a real accomplishment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to commend both you and Mr. Scott. Scott, I'm sorry for their for your for your efforts and your department's hard work on this. I know that there was a lot of collaboration with other other agencies to get us to this point.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I also want to join Councilman Austin in these remarks. This is truly a historic moment for North Long Beach, and it's difficult to really understand how much time and how many years have gone into this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so to help sort of illustrate that, we do have we invited the last three generations of council people in District nine to come down to speak about this. And and I'm happy to say that we do have member Val Large here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to I want to just if if you allow Mr. Mayor, I'd like to allow councilmember former vice mayor to just give some remarks. From a historical context, I got a chance to serve as a chief of staff for a previous ninth district councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when we came in, the project was already ten years old when the last councilmember came in. So I'm hoping a councilmember version is give a little historical context for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect. Well, it's perfect. We're going to public comment now on it. So our former vice mayor will be the first one to speak.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Mr. Mayor. Members of the council honored to be here. It's two weeks in a row now. I feel like I belong back behind her. Dias. I just couldn't escape. 35 years ago. A community known as the Forest Park community had a dream of making a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nature trail between the gap of the Forest Park and the Los Angeles River banks. My predecessor, Mr. Schulz, before he was on the city council and the community went out and got a nursery to donate over 300 trees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as a community, we planted those trees along that gap. We call it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The the forest. Forest Trail. The forest bark trails.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, remember, that was 35 years ago. I was much younger. Everybody in that community was much younger. Some of you on this list.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Were just starting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'School. We worked hard. Every couple of months we would go into that area and we would clean it out. We'd place the trees. But there was no city funding, no county funding at all for the maintenance of the trail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I came on council in 2002, I worked with council member Frank Colonna, who was a member of the Mountain, a conservative river conservancy. And in 2003, we got $3 million from that organization to get the plans together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was 2003, but 2004 we had plans and those plans for the wetlands have been.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There ever since. So I'm grateful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thankful that we're finally going to see after 13 years of actually having plans, we're finally going to have the wetlands of the forest wetlands again. If you guys can hurry it up, I'd like to see it. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. It's been a long 35 year process for the city, for the community of the Forest Park. And we're looking forward to be able to walk the trails and safety over the next couple of years.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Laurie Angel. I live in North Long Beach for 58 East Platt Street and I was involved in redevelopment for about 16 years. And this is a continuation of the Dominguez gap, which is something that we all were interested in, as well as the development along the L.A. River.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The only thing I want to mention, I mean, I'm really looking forward to the project. I think everybody is. I think it's going to be a huge improvement for the area, make it much more appealing for people to go out there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you have equestrian trails that was mentioned, but they stop at the Alamo. So the actual trail that's supposed to continue through and go all the way up to Sacramento or up to San Francisco, wherever the heck it goes, it stops at Del Amo because the trail doesn't go through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if there is a way to put in some kind of a signal for the equestrian folks so they can actually use the trail, they're kind of a forgotten group and they need to have some representation, too. So if that could be considered, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening. And Cantrell and I first discovered the DeForest Park Trail with the El Dorado Audubon. We found a lot of rare and unusual birds there. And and hearing that you're going to be taking out non-native plants. I hope that doesn't include the old growth trees that are there, even though they're non-native, especially like the eucalyptus.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They are well used by birds for foraging and roosting and nesting. Also, I heard that this is going to start in January and I know you're anxious to get this started, but I would like to remind you that the birding season is January through September.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so if there is any removal of trees, this would. Interfere with the. Birdy breeding time for the birds. So I hope that's been taken into consideration. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Darlene Groom. I live in the Forest Park. I am Hispanic. They speak about the 13 years it's taken to get this program underway. Well, I've been here living in the Forest Park for 13 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand a lot of the things and the problems that some people are having. But I live there. I see the wildlife that walks through the streets. I can look out my window any morning. I may see a a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Vulture.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rabbits, all of those there walking down the street, but they're walking on the concrete. What a great idea this is to reinvent our the forest wetlands, bring it back to life, make it what it should be, and give our children here in Long Beach something other to look at than the concrete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Give them the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Experiences that they won't otherwise have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we don't do these things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you for your time, and I appreciate all that you do for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speaker, please. But we have another one coming.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. My name is Dan Press Burg. I'm the president of the de Force, the Forest Neighborhood Association. Good evening, honorable mayors, mayor, council members and staff. This is a great opportunity for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a great.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Plan that's going to be happening here. We love the idea. I remember when we I had hundreds of meetings with Val and Frank Callaghan over this and just trying to get money for this. It's an amazing thing. Everybody that I know of in our area is ecstatic.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're looking forward to it. Can't wait to break break ground. Hopefully it'll be in December before nesting time. So anyway, we'd like to thank you and thank you for all you do.'",

I have spoken previously in out for the equestrian community and so I won't review all of the comments that I've made on October 20th and November 3rd, but I do encourage you to review those detailed comments in support of the equestrian community and the historic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'trail preservation and our needs. And for those of you who are here, who have not heard me speak in the past, I encourage you to review both that verbal and written comment. I'm here to supplement those comments and just encourage that with this project and every other project along the L.A. River that there be detailed review and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'concern or address and of the equestrian community's needs. There continue to be deficient connections for a continuous trail experience. So you have impacted a cumulative negative impact on the mobility of the equestrians in a safe, continuous ride experience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as another speaker mentioned, there is not a connection in this plan to tie it with the prior Deming ESCAP Wetlands Project that was completed. So what you end up with are or corrupted interrupted segments of trails that are not being adequately addressed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've touched in the past and I won't go into detail about it, but these are trails that date to the 1700s. You have new state legislation AB 530, which addresses the fact that the L.A. River Master Plan is 20 years antiquated and needs to be reviewed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one of the biggest review deficiencies of the L.A. River Master Plan, this particular project, the DeForest Wetlands and all of the other related projects in the River Recreation Area, is the fact that the equestrian community and all the impacts these projects have are not really completely being addressed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's safety signage that needs to be included. We've discussed that on one project, but it does need to be incorporated into this project. And I support wetlands and I support open space and I support development that's planned and and done thoughtfully.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this particular community has continued to be ignored and not heard. And even though we are a small number, our numbers continue to dwindle because of the fact that we have not been included in projects both on a large scale and individually on a small scale.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I request that you consider my comments from the past and do incorporate better planning for the equestrian users.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Mr. Good, you are good.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You click as the address, which is not in the ninth district, but I fully support it. I pass and look at that area every time I go up and coming down on the blue line. And I think it's a fantastic project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I would hope, I would hope that to take into consideration the views of the good and curtail content drought control relative to the bird season. It would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bathwater.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'd like to think that we've got the competence and the the energy and the understanding sufficient to move forward with that without destroying that habitat. An interesting thing that I never knew about, one, it was just about, as a matter of fact, eight weeks ago when the going down on the blue line, somebody who's apparently lived'",
        "'speaker_9': 'here for a long time, told me way back when that they used to come up and do and catch lobsters. In those waters. And this was before. And the point was just before or just. About 2 minutes before the Wardlow station down there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it'll be really interesting to see if we can bring it back to something approaching that state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. We're done with public comment. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just one more thing I need to do. I want to make sure that we do acknowledge and publicly thank the funders. It was a funding funding that took all this time. So San Gabriel in Lower Los Angeles, Rivers, the Mountains Conservancy, Los Angeles County Regional Parks and Open Space District, California Natural Resources Agency and the State'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of California Coastal Conservancy. So important that we acknowledge them. Just to state we're breaking ground December 1st. So as before the nesting season and the reason we have two years construction is because that was taken in consideration as well as establishment periods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So all those things have been taken to consideration. I hope to see you all at the groundbreaking. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'As I said earlier, all streets and drives within the development will be privately owned. Each house is going to have their own private two car garage. Guest parking is required as part of this project and would be provided on the main circular road.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Additional guest parking above code requirement has been provided. Guest parking is not allowed to be used for storage of excess cars or trailers. There will be a homeowners association that will have conditions of approval that will require the property owners to park their cars in the garages, not park in the in the guest spaces and not park'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in their driveways. This is a representative example of the layout of these cul de sac streets around the ring road where each small street is basically a cluster of six homes in a very neighborly like setting. And all of the entrances front the street, as well as the driveways.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We were we worked quite a bit with the developer in honing and refining the architectural style. When it was originally submitted, there was multiple architectural styles as well as I'd say, 11 different floorplans and we were able to narrow that down for a more cohesive neighborhood environment and worked with the architects on the high quality architecture that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'they are going to be proposing. So this was a representative example of their different plans for two storey homes and then also their representative plans for three storey homes. We spent a lot of time working on the architecture, making sure that the massing and setbacks for the homes were appropriate, that there was a lot of light and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'open space with the homes, as well as clearly no blank walls fronting the streets. This project does require a number of entitlements. First and foremost is the certification of an environmental impact report. This project includes a general plan amendment to change the general plan designation of the Boy Scout site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It also includes a general plan amendment for a community park that would be developed outside of the projects boundaries. This would allow the city the ability to have the park at Oregon and Alamo constructed, which was a former redevelopment project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll get into that in a little while. We're also asking that the city council consider a zoning amendment to create a new planned unit development ordinance, as well as a zone change for the River Walk site and the Oregon Park site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This also requires site plan review, which the Planning Commission is recommending vesting tentative tract maps that the property can be subdivided for individual ownership, and then a statutory development agreement, which is quite critical to the the development of this entire project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to talk a little bit about the zoning because this is a little bit new for you as a city, as a city, a seated council. We do have areas in the city where we have developed this type of housing, but they are not known to be developed under the PUD term, which is a technical planning'",
        "'speaker_6': 'term. But the creation of a PD allows quite a bit of flexibility for the city in how it works with developers in laying out traditional development sites for residential property. Tonight's action, I want to make it extremely clear, is site specific only?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There have been numerous blogs and Web posts indicating that your action tonight would clear the way for this zoning to apply be applied to other institutional zoning districts citywide. And that is categorically false. Tonight's zoning request would allow the creation of a brand new zoning district, but it is only being applied specifically to tonight's site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If anyone else in the city that has a property that is currently zoned institutional wishes to take advantage of this, they must go through the traditional process of a rezoning with public hearings and public input. A plan development unit also allows us to configure densities like like allowing three story units in the center of this project and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'two story units on the edge of the project. This is very similar to how Spinnaker Bay was developed in District three, although that was developed under sea dip many years ago. It has a similar look and feel. This is also similar to the Crown Point project in I believe it's in District seven now, right near Los Cerritos'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Park, off of Del Mar Avenue that has a similar look and feel as well. With that pad and those densities, we are able to achieve a higher quality development through the use of this pad. When you're dealing with a large subdivision and so we are asking for your consideration of doing that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The pad that we have selected has been also the subject of quite a bit of discussion over the last year. The developer had looked for higher density than the city staff was comfortable with and we eventually settled on a density of approximately 13 dwelling units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To give you a reference point, the The Crown Point Project on Del Mar Avenue has a higher density than 13 units per acre. That's actually at 14.5 units per acre. So that's the one that we were able to find that currently exists that's most applicable to this project, although that one has higher density.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The development agreement is a tool that we are allowed to utilize under state law. So this is a statutory development agreement which gives the city the authority to enter into a long term contract or agreement. We have previously entered into development agreements for most notably the Douglas Park Project with Boeing, and we also recently entered into a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'development agreement for the Golden Shore Development Project in the downtown. So this would be a similar type of contract. It provides the city the opportunity to negotiate benefits for the city. Above and beyond those are which are normally allowed under traditional planning entitlements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This project and this development agreement would be a ten year contract. It would reserve the rights to the developer for this zoning designation for that entire period of time. It does, as I said, allow the city to to accrue benefits, if you will, to the city in exchange for higher density.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In this case, we are looking at significant public improvements, including the construction of a park at Oregon and Alamo, which has been stalled due to the dissolution of the redevelopment agency. In addition to the public improvements which will detail later, the developer will also commit $100,000 in cash to the city to be placed in a traffic mitigation'",
        "'speaker_6': 'fund that will be used at the discretion of the city engineer, the city traffic engineer in order to mitigate ongoing or future neighborhood traffic mitigation issues that may arise. Additionally, since the developer will be constructing a number of public improvements for the city, we are requiring a performance bond that is 115% of the total amount of the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'public improvements. We have pored over this project, as I said, and have a number of conditions of approval, which I think are valuable in protecting the city and ensuring that this project will be the quality project that we expect it to be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There will be a construction management plan that is going to manage construction traffic throughout the entire time of construction. There will be a new minimum of six foot six, but up to an eight foot block wall that will surround the site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we have the ability to to go higher if that is the desire of the city council through a zoning administrator process. We are asking them to bring adjacent streets and sidewalks into ADA compliance, do significant public improvements along the adjacent streets, including Daisy and Oregon Pacific, 48th and 49th streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We will be asking them to either grind an overlay or to slurry as determined by the city's director of public works. A number of streets in that area, and that includes 48th Street, Pacific Avenue and 49th Street. I believe the developer has an exhibit which will show the extent of the offsite improvements that the city is requiring'",
        "'speaker_6': 'as part of this project. I am going to momentarily turn this over to Joe Power of Rincon. He's going to address the Environmental Impact Report and the process that we went through in order to get to where we are today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you could bring that PowerPoint back up, it's the same PowerPoint that Joe will be using that I was just referring to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thanks, Amy. Again, Joe Power from Rincon Consultants. We assisted the city in the preparation of the Environmental Impact Report. I'm here tonight with Greg Martin. Our project manager will both be here to answer questions, if any come up later tonight.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm going to quickly talk about the process and then I'm going to talk about some of the air findings to begin the process. The city issued a notice of preparation of the draft air back on September 4th of of 2014, that there was a 30 day comment period in which you were taking input on the air scope'",
        "'speaker_13': 'that ended around October 3rd. During that 30 day period, the city also held two public scoping meetings. Those were on September 24th and September 30th. We had a number of attendees and got a lot of input from the community regarding their concerns for the project.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then most recently, the draft IRR was circulated for the required 45 day public review period in May. The final air on the air includes responses to 23 comment letters that the city received during that 45 day public review period.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Those included four letters from agencies and 19 from individuals, mainly folks living in the neighborhood, the adjacent neighborhood. The final air also includes the draft air text with some minor eddies, mainly requiring involving some clarifications that were that came up in the responses to comments, as well as the mitigation, monitoring and reporting program.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The final year determined that with all recommended mitigation measures, impacts associated with the project could be reduced to below a level of significance. Here's just a very quick overview of the process. I mentioned that notice of preparation and up at the top.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's where we got input on the air scope. Then the draft air was circulated for public review. With those comments, we responded to all of them, prepared the mitigation monitoring program and the findings and all that is before you tonight where we're ready to make a decision on the project.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Now the environmental impacts are identified in the air. We had no Class one or what we call significant and unavoidable impacts. There were a number of impacts that we identified as significant, but that could be mitigated to below a level of significance with mitigation measures included in the air.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Those were in the areas of air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, geology, land use, noise and vibration and utilities and service systems. Now just a quick overview of the impacts that we found to be significant, but medical for air quality, this related to construction emissions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And we had two mitigation measures to address both dust and emissions associated with construction equipment. And with those measures, we could bring the impacts to below a level of significance for biological resources, the impact that we identified significant related to potential impacts to nesting bats and birds, and that's addressed through a pre-construction survey and as necessary avoidance'",
        "'speaker_13': 'of any nest that are identified during that survey. For the area of cultural resources, we found potential impacts related to archeological and paleontological resources. There are no known resources on the site, but the mitigation is there to address as yet unidentified resources that may be uncovered as grading occurs on site for the area of geology, the impact'",
        "'speaker_13': 'related to liquefaction and settlement. And we have a mitigation measure requiring placement of properly compacted fill, as well as another measure requiring the building foundation to be properly designed to address those kinds of impacts for land use and planning.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The impact relate to local policy consistency, and this impact is really addressed by mitigation measures found throughout the air in such issues as noise, air quality and the like. And then lastly, for utilities and service systems, the impact related to wastewater infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And we have a mitigation measure, measure requiring the applicant to submit a sewer study and if necessary, upgrade the sewer system to provide needed capacity. Now again, just to reiterate the opportunities for public comment, there have been a number of them that in OPI that I mentioned previously, back in September of last year, there were the two'",
        "'speaker_13': 'scoping meetings also held in September. The draft IIR public circulation. From May 5th to June 18th. There was a planning commission study session during that public review period on May 21st and then a planning commission hearing on October 15th and of course, tonight's hearing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Now, in addition to the significant impacts that we identified, I want to touch on a number of items that the community expressed concerned about. And in some cases, we identified significant impacts in these areas. And in others we didn't.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'One that I'd say was the top concern that we heard from members of the community was traffic in specifically cut through traffic on Daisy and through the residential neighborhood adjacent. Air quality was a concern. Land use and zoning changes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Amy touched on that a little earlier. Noise was a concern. Parking and soil stability and seismic hazards are going to go through those very quickly. For traffic. There were concerns both about construction traffic as well as operational traffic for construction.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The grading phase would generate about 236 daily trips. Those would be spaced out over the course of the day. Generally, we think avoiding peak hour times building the building construction phase would generate the highest number of peak hour trips by employee trips with about 54.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There was a traffic analysis done of the construction vehicles and how they would affect the system. And it was determined that that the level of service standards of the city would not be exceeded by construction traffic. Nevertheless, as Amy mentioned earlier, a construction management plan is going to be required to ensure that traffic is managed during construction'",
        "'speaker_13': '. With respect to operational traffic, the project would generate an estimated 98 Olympic hour trips and 131 peak hour trips. The impact would not exceed the city's level of service standards at any of the study intersections. The larger concern was about that we heard was an increase in traffic on local streets, in particular Daisy Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I will say that there was would be in percentage terms a pretty substantial increase in traffic going from an estimated, I think it was 75 daily trips to over 1200. However, the city does not have a specific significance threshold or standard for trips on residential streets, so we did not identify a significant impact despite that pretty substantial'",
        "'speaker_13': 'increase in percentage terms. Air quality. This was about both construction and operational emissions. We did the modeling based using the standard procedures based on South Coast Air Quality Management District guidelines. We did not find any operational impacts that would be significant or that would exceed AQ MDA thresholds.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Project construction, as I mentioned before, would generate emissions exceeding thresholds. But with mitigation measures, recommended impacts could be brought below significant. Next slide noise. There were concerns about both construction noise and operational noise. Construction noise would be temporary and would occur only during daytime hours, so it would not be significant there, although there clearly would be an'",
        "'speaker_13': 'increase in noise and does not exceed the level of significance. There's really not anything unusual about the construction noise. It would just be it's just going to be loud as construction is. With respect to operational traffic noise, we did model traffic noise based on the air traffic study and found that though there would be an increase in'",
        "'speaker_13': 'noise on a number of streets, Daisy Avenue in particular, that increase would not exceed city standards or thresholds. With respect to parking, the air does recommend that construction management plan that I mentioned before to address parking concerns during construction.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Within the long term, the project includes 302 parking spaces, including 260 private parking garage parking spaces and 40 on street guest parking spaces. I will just mention as an aside as well, parking really is not a sequel issue per se that was removed from the the secret guidelines about five years ago.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So it's not an issue we typically are looking at as a potentially significant impact. In sequel terms. Soil stability. The issue that we heard about was a concern that the site may have formerly been used as a landfill.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We did not see any evidence of that particular issue. There was a phase one environmental site assessment done for the site, and there was no historic record of there being a landfill there. I skipped over the first concern.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'A number of folks expressed concern about there maybe being a fault trace running through the site. Again, we've seen no evidence of that based on local or state maps mapping. Fault zones through the city. We do have a number of soil stability mitigation measures to address potential concern.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There was the landfill concern was largely about the potential for settlement and how that might affect the project and adjoining neighborhoods. We do have these measures that I mentioned before. Excavation, too adapted for people of existing grade to address foundation concerns as well as the recurring foundation systems to use specific items to address this impact.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'No alternatives. We didn't study for alternatives. These are required by secure. These were the no project alternative. That one is required under Sequoia and assumes that this site would remain in its present condition. The second one is what we call the reduced density alternative, and that would essentially comply with the current zoning for the site.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'About 65 units total for about half of what is proposed. We have an alternate alternate site alternative that would put all of the residential development on the Oregon Park site that is proposed for a park that was one that was suggested by the community.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then the revised access alternative, again, this was suggested by the community during the scoping process would involve two points of access, one at DC and another at Oregon. With respect to the alternatives, we really didn't find that they would eliminate any significant impacts.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The revised access alternate, for example, would we think, move some trips perhaps up to Oregon Avenue. But as some of you are aware, north of 48th Street, Oregon really narrows. And we think that's going to be difficult for people to pass.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And they're probably going to go right back to D.C. and use that to get out of the neighborhood anyway. So we don't think there's going to be a substantial change in the traffic pattern based on that alternative. As I mentioned before, the EIA, the project does not have any significant, unavoidable impacts.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So of course, the although the all of the alternatives may incrementally reduce impacts, they would not avoid any significant impacts that that would have under the project anyway. Back to Amy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Joe. So the planning commission did hear this in a study session in May. They made comments and got a briefing on the air, which was in circulation. They then held a public hearing in October and did recommend that the City Council certify the air and grant all of the entitlements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As I said earlier, it's an extensive list of entitlements and so I'd like to walk you through them. Some of these are a little bit less common for you to see. The first one is your standard resolution certifying the air.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is something that you are required to adopt should you choose to move forward in certifying the air the section. The second action is to adopt a resolution amending the land use element. This allows us to change the land use designation for the Riverwalk site from Elwood 11 to Elwood three.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A It's essentially from an open space institutional zone to a residential zone. We're also asking you to adopt a resolution amending the land use element for the for the Oregon Park site. The Oregon Park site has been approved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It has its own environmental document. However, the amendment to the general plan was never done due to the dissolution of the redevelopment agency. So we are asking for your consideration of changing the land use designation from Elwood one to Elodie 11, which would be open space.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're asking for a zone change on the River Walk site from Institutional to the RPE 13, which is our new PUD zoning classification. We are asking you to make a zone change from institutional to park to allow the construction of the park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're asking you to declare an ordinance allowing the city manager to execute a development agreement in substantially the same form that is presented to you tonight. Also investing tentative tract map, which would allow for the subdivision of the 131 homes into individual parcels for sale.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Clearly a review of the site plan. Then the next ones are a little bit less common for you to see. We are asking that you consider an ordinance to allow a credit against the transportation improvement fee. The staff report details that the developer expects to expend at least $1.65 million on traffic improvements in the immediate neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there is a credit that we would be asking you to consider in that they would normally be paying a traffic improvement fee of $147,000. So we're asking you to give them a credit for the $147,000 in exchange for the $1.65 million in improvements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Similarly, they would be required to pay a Parks and Rec facility fee in the amount of $604,308. Instead, we are asking that you give them a credit and instead accept the construction of the Oregon Dilemma Park, which has a developer value of approximately $2.25 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So again, instead of accepting $604,000 in cash, we would instead be giving them a credit in exchange for $2.25 million in park improvements. Lastly, we would ask that you declare an ordinance allowing a zoning amendment for the creation of this new PWD ordinance that would allow this new zoning designation to be in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have two items of correction that I'd like to make. One is that the resolution granting the credit for the transportation improvement fees did not include the correct dollar amount. So we would ask that you allow the city attorney's office to provide the correct amount of the traffic improvement fees in that ordinance at $1.65 million or more'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The second thing that I would ask is that in the development agreement, we would like to add a clause that would give discretion to the director of public works to determine whether the streets in the surrounding area need to be slurry sealed or whether they needed to be have a full grind mill grind and overlay applied to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'it. This will allow the the director to have discretion to say a portion of this street is eligible for salary seal, but the other portion of the street must have a full overlay constructed. The developer understands that request, and that would be to Exhibit C of the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No other changes to the development agreement are expected at this time, but we do have in the ordinance authorization for the city manager to execute the development agreement in substantially the same form that you have it in front of you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm happy to answer any questions at this point, or we can take public comment at your pleasure. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I believe we're going to go through the applicant the applicant part of the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry. Yes. We would like to introduce the applicant. This is Ed Gallagher from Integral Communities. He has a presentation that we would like to bring up. And so with that, I'll introduce Ed Kane.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're putting another applicant who requested. Well, two things. One. Mr. Mays mentioned me. The applicant requested 15 minutes for the presentation, and then the applicant also requested an opportunity to do the five minute at the end rebuttal. If there's anything that he wants to to rebut.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that correct, Mr. Mays?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Just for that, for the hearing process there. So with that, Madam Clerk, I can just make sure you set the time for for this and please begin.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Mary Garcia, members of the Long Beach City Council. My name is Ed Gallagher with Integral Communities in Newport Beach. And we want to thank the staff for the amount of hard work they've put in and all of the all the negotiations that we've done.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I think that the the the we have a vision we had a vision of what we wanted to see with the development and we worked with staff for it's been over two years now and we think we have a community that's a, a great community and we think that the staff has, has enabled the city to'",
        "'speaker_14': 'get a lot of public benefits out of this. And we completely concur with that. Um. We started this in December of 2013, and here we are today without going through all the steps which aren't necessary. I think we want to focus on a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'One is that we have really think that we've made a really strong effort to engage the community in what we've been doing all throughout the process. Our first community meeting was in November of 2013 at Mike and Diana Julia's house, who live on 48th Street, the back up to the project.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We then had another neighborhood meeting once the project was fully designed and had gone through a conceptual review and comment by the city. And we came up with a plan that you see before you tonight. And we had another meeting on on July 30th at the George House.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I want to thank them so much for being accommodating. We then had a meeting in mid-August of 2014 at the Del Amo Mobile Home Park to address concerns and questions that the mobile home park residents may have.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And as as was said by Rincon, we had a scoping meeting in September of 2014 to meetings in September of 2014. And we heard what the residents had to say, and we've tried to address those concerns. We finally had another another neighborhood meeting, adult elementary school in November of 2014.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'As we've gone through the process and the EIA, the draft here was was out. Do we Amy, could we play the video?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, Jeff is.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We have a little video that we'd like you to see that kind of capsulize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For what.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Community? A planned community is in the neighborhood bounded by Del Amo Boulevard, Long Beach Boulevard, the Los Angeles River and the Virginia Country Club. Oregon Park today and Oregon Park in the future. The development of Oregon Park, which will have a multi-use artificial turf field, will take place simultaneously with the development of River Walk, transforming this vacant'",
        "'speaker_5': 'lot into a beautifully landscaped and active destination for the neighborhood. It will have a large parking lot surrounded by picnic areas, a playground with state of the art equipment, fitness stations and also modern restrooms. The park will serve the city of Long Beach and the families who live not only in this neighborhood but other neighborhoods as well'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Today, Riverwalk is vacant land that will be converted from unused property to a new home planned community with a dramatic entry supported with quality architecture. Next to the secondary exit gate at the terminus of Oregon Avenue, there will be a tot lot serving the children of the Riverwalk community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As we enter the community, we pass through the entry gates, pass the recreation center and travel the street that loops completely around the community delivering the homeowners to their new destination. The homes are designed with variations of the Spanish theme, all with two car garages and fenced rear yards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The entire community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Including the streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Interior landscaping and the new landscaping on Daisy and Oregon Avenue, will be managed and maintained by a professional homeowners association. What a beautiful community and what a great addition to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you. When bringing the application before the city of Long Beach and the Planning Commission in the City Council. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We want to kind of capsule8 the the what we think are public benefits and how we feel as a public private partnership to to develop this community and to to create benefits for the city. Obviously, you've heard a lot about Oregon Park, and it's a 3.3 acres.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It's got a an athletic field that accommodates a regulation soccer field and it accommodates a couple of other things. Amy, can you put those on the screen? The park alternatives. It'll accommodate to youth soccer fields. It will accommodate a two softball or little league diamonds, and it will accommodate a star in the video yet.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But it will accommodate a miniature football field 70 yards long. Um, and we're, we've in the development agreement, the details of the park improvements are have been enhanced quite a bit to the tune of about an additional $400,000.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So that 2.25 is more like 2.6 to $3 million. We have state of the art restrooms and restrooms have grown have grown to be twice as large as they were to begin with. We have six fitness stations instead of one.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We have play equipment for two different age groups instead of one. And we have state of the art lighting that went from 15 to 20000 a night to 60,000. So I hope these lights are really good. And so I think that the the the park itself is is a is a it's a it's going to be a'",

We want to put that one back up, Amy. The next thing I wanted to go through is the off site street improvements that were that we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And you can see by this map behind you, it's pretty hard to read, but I'll go through it quickly. You can see that there is a traffic signal that's at Del Amo and Oregon Avenue. If you come down, you'll see that there's full street improvements from 48th Avenue South on Oregon and 48 Avenue South on Daisy.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There is a Oregon Avenue frontage improvements right in front of the park with new curbs and gutters and sidewalks and landscaping. Then from 48th Avenue there is grind and overlay and new ada handicapped ramps on the three intersections of 48th and Oregon and Daisy and Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'In addition, you can see in the blue that those streets which are Pacific 49th and 48th Street, we are we are replacing the curb and gutter on those streets as applicable, which probably is going to be a lot.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And then we're either going to slurry or we're going to do grind and overlay, depending on the condition of the street and what the street will handle physically. So we're doing a lot of road improvements that are necessary, and we think that the community is going to benefit but is really going to look sharp.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You'll also see on the map that there are two access points to the walking path that are next to the Dominguez Gap wetlands, one from Oregon Park and one from the subdivision, too, to to allow access through the public, through the public and the private community.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And as Amy said, we're in the 1.6 to 1.7 million for those street improvements. I think in addition to these improvements, there are other benefits to the city. Property values are obviously going to go up. The property taxes just from this community will generate about $900,000 a year in increased property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Local businesses are going to benefit by business generated from the residents of this community. Jobs are going to be created. And we we.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are.'",

And we think that this community and this development, both the community itself and the park, is creating increasing opportunities for youth activities, enhances the existing neighborhood, and it's making an economic reinvestment in this area'",
        "'speaker_14': '. We we realize the temporary inconveniences to our neighbors and an effort of that consideration. We've reached out to Daisy residents and offered to enhance the neighborhood. The neighborhood? So far, what we've done in that neighborhood is and I'll try to go through it quickly, it's a big list, but we've painted 39 houses, we've installed 19 fences painted'",
        "'speaker_14': ', six fences painted. We planted drought resistant yards, we've installed window blinds. We've removed 42 tons of trash, installed six security lights, port two driveway pads, repaired four walkways, and the list goes on and on. And we've spent a lot of money doing it because we feel that the neighbors deserve it.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And we want we want the neighborhood to feel good about this development. I think that I think that we're we're really excited about developing the site and hopefully the city council will be just as excited as we are.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Although D Andrews is in here, so I hope he abstains.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'From the vote. Before certifying this EIA, please ask staff the following four questions How can it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be justified in the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'EIA using the Long Beach average of 2.8 persons per household? While these include tens of thousands of one in ten, one and two bedroom units, while the well, what they're going to build, they're going to be three and four bedroom units.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The U.S. Census report indicates 3.6 persons, which is a 29% understatement of all impacts. Second, why are they using 2.0 vehicles per household when the U.S. average is 2.3? This understatement equals 40 additional vehicles for which there is no room to park and the development they will have to park in the already crowded nearby area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Third, why was the fact that Oregon, which is only 18 foot wide and the Daisy and 48 Street, which are only 30 foot wide, was omitted from the report. Doesn't even mention it. Recommended street widths are 36 foot, with 32 foot being the minimum.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Will this not create even more unsafe conditions with this increased traffic? Fourth. What specific street do they intend to use for the projected 2064 dump trucks of dirt? If any of these mentioned streets are to be used, how are the vehicles going to pass each other?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They can't get through. The air is flawed and biased and should be rejected because all impacts and mitigation measures are underestimated. Adoption of the reduced density alternative allowing 65 homes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Will be the the need to revise.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The R and B in keeping with the current zoning. You are inviting a lawsuit under the California Environmental Quality Act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you certified the sea air and approve these 131 homes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I beg you to ask those for common sense questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mayor and council people. My name is Don Hobson. I live at 4965 Pacific Avenue. I didn't come with a speech tonight. I've lived there 27 years. I've witnessed many accidents at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The intersection of Pacific and Alamo, which is not signaled.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The majority of the traffic in the neighborhood use this Pacific Avenue because it's wide enough that two people can pass each other going opposite directions. Daisy Avenue. That's not possible. It's a give and go situation and they're talking about increasing the traffic load to 1200.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Homes, but 65 homes would be a lot less impact and more.'",

Water bill availability. Lack of solar artificial turf in the Oregon park, the PD and adverse biological effects on the project site and the nearby Dominguez Gap.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The mitigation for the birds and the other wildlife is inadequate. Putting a 25 foot zone, a buffer zone around a nesting site is not going to help the birds with the construction noise and the people that are around there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It was stated that the project would not have a substantial adverse effect on any repair and habitat, federally protected wetlands or any other sensitive natural communities. This is 200 feet from the defense gap. How can they say that the noise of the construction and the traffic will not have an effect on the habitat of the Dominguez gap'",
        "'speaker_12': '? Also the pod's zoning is, uh. We've tried increase density before with cracker boxes in the 1980s with disastrous results no available parking, increased crime and deteriorating neighborhoods. Staff calls this good urban planning. Anyone familiar with the rat and mice studies of John B Calhoun would disagree with this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'He saw a breakdown in social structure and normal social behavior when rodents were crowded together. They were given everything they needed except space. As the population increased, the behavior deteriorated until finally the population quit breeding. High density doesn't work for rats and it doesn't work for humans.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Instead of changing the zoning, the developer should change the project. And if you insist on allowing this flawed project to proceed. Do not make this a one size fits all zoning by allowing similar crowded conditions in other projects around the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In addition to space, the city does not have the water nor the infrastructure to continue to increase its population. Please deny this disastrous plan.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The from open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And park to townhomes is just a big mistake. In the northwest part of Long Beach, we're very much underserved with open space and parks.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Resolution to amend the land use element of the general plan from DE 11 to D3. It's just wrong. So I urge you to vote against this.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'It's it just it needs a lot of help. Now, that presentation was very nice. But it was like putting lipstick on a pig. You know, they didn't point out the railroad tracks right on one boundary. I live in a two story house and believe me, it takes a while to get that second story.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they're going to build some three story homes. You know, I've never heard of a three story house. I don't live in that. I mean, you'd have to have an elevator in every one of these houses. If if I took one view after this project was built as a client to take a look at this project, you'd'",
        "'speaker_7': 'say, turn this car around. I will not live here. And this developer, Mr. Gallagher, seemed like a nice fella. But someone should have told him back in December of 2013. It's not here. It it doesn't work here. Education's real important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All of you that have had children or grandchildren, you know how important education is. And you want your children in the best schools that you can look up on. Look on the Internet and you can judge schools. It's terrific.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you've got a you've got a2a3 and a five rating on schools. That's just totally unsatisfactory. No one would move there if they had children. No, I don't know. No prices were quoted, but I've heard $600,000 for one of these units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's you're not going to have a homeowner or someone with children wanting to live there with those low ratings on schools. God bless the schools. I'm sure they're doing the best they can do. But anybody who's going to invest 5 to $600000 in that area would have to have better schools than that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they certainly are not going to send it to private schools because we just can't afford that. So. So I would tell you, too, that in the eighties, when I was selling real estate, I always wanted to testify against a project that was destroying the community again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And just project zip is like the cracker boxes in the eighties. Please don't do this to the community.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Renee Lawler. I live in Wrigley on San Francisco Avenue. And you hear a consistent theme in my message regarding equestrian. And this is another project that is in the L.A. River Recreation area that does not address adequately the negative impacts to the equestrian community and the historic trail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this this project does have a Class one issue where the equestrian community has not been addressed. Not only do the Wrigley equestrians rely on the trail that's directly adjacent to this project subject zone, but also the stables in DeLand, Alamo, and any equestrian that use that uses the trail system is potentially negatively experiencing a negative impact'",
        "'speaker_1': '. You have a high density development which is directly opposing what the equestrian experience is all about, and to put a high density development right on top of the historic trail without including and incorporating setbacks, without incorporating safety signage, when when you're having all of those new homeowners access and cross over the trail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, I reiterate the dangers and concerns that that are not really being addressed for that equestrian community. You have existing zoning law here in the city of Long Beach. You've got an equestrian overlay document which is applicable to the Wrigley Equestrian Zone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But there are certain guidelines within that horse overlay that talk about setback with respect to residents, with respect to anything that is adjacent to, you know, that is residential adjacent to an equestrian existing equestrian area. And and that that zoning overlay should have some application to this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In addition, you are basically inhibiting and eliminating the continuous mobility of the equestrian user groups. If you proceed with the construction of this project during the time of construction, I understand that there's going to be about a two or three year period of construction with the contractors intending to utilize the the river easement and or trail area'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for for construction vehicles and equipment and access. So you have disrupted the trail not only from the Delano users coming south, but the equestrians in Wrigley going north. And you've provided no mitigation plan for alternative route for that equestrian trail and the users that are currently dependent upon it, it's our lifeline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the only access we have for exercising our horses and we need to be considered. And I oppose this. I ask you not to vote for this project.'",

I'm sorry you have to see this side of me tonight. But my concerns for the Riverwalk housing project led me to petition against it as well as other my other 250 neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_1': 'residents. My blood pressure is up in my thoughts for peaceful retirement. I don't imagine squeezing 131 homes and ten acres. Of land that is just incomprehensible to me. I will also add that not once during the planning committee meeting was the possibility of a reduced density alternative discussed or debated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This would at least lessen the number.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of homes to.'",
        "'speaker_1': '65 that could be built. Because of the number of petitioners who could not attend this meeting and have their voices heard, either due to their work schedules this evening or the availability of free VIP bussing to City Hall, such as was provided to selected residents only by the developer this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This seems to present a very biased situation. We have been an unheard group of residents, even by our eighth District Council member, Mr. Elston, who never wanted to share our grievances and the impact of this project with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But come election time, Mr. Austin, you will feel the impact of the voters. It appears your goal is to build a park at Oregon and Delano and generate more tax revenue. Great idea. But did you have to trade off to the Will Rogers Boy Scout camp to accomplish this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Parking issues. Traffic noise, more pollution. I plead with the council. Is this what you would want? Your neighborhood? You want to Disneyland in your backyard? I think not. Council, can you please tell me one question? Are petitions still do they still hold a voice in today's public?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is it a waste to go and have petitions? I have 250 petitioners here, local residents that have lived there as long as I have. We're mortified with this. We do not want this in our area. It doesn't fit.'",

        "'speaker_1': ', in the community. I do see with the project itself a very beneficial, um, can I say an increase in quality of living being introduced. And I think that also impacts the schools. I have been working in schools for several decades and I have also started out in schools that have been on the lower end of the rating'",
        "'speaker_1': 'having difficulty. But I've also seen when there has been an introduction into the community with a more, uh, increase in quality of living, you tend to get more involvement in the schools as well from the families. That in turn also increases the quality of the schools.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Me as a college student, that's a big concern. And, um, I just think having more jobs in general is great, especially in that area. I think it'll boost the economy. I think it to me it sounds as though the developers are very interested in not only making the quality of life for the development and.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'No one gave us warning. No one mentioned anything about the contractors coming in. But now we're faced with cracks. All of our house. Some of these cracks look very I mean, it's really frustrating. So if if those cracks are from trees, once they start shifting to Earth, what's going to become of our house, not just our house'",
        "'speaker_3': '? What about our neighbor house who's elderly? Can't speak. What about the neighbors down the street? You know, I think it's great that the city of receiving revenue, I'm I'm totally with that. But it shouldn't be done at the expense of somebody losing their home or home caving in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They come home. Major problems at home. Who's going to fix this problem? You know, we're faced with problem problems right now that we trying to wonder who's going to fix this? No one. No one young lady gave me her card, told me to call her by the name of Miss Diane Ripley, sent her email.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was like four weeks ago. And she says, You call me in two weeks. Never heard nothing back from her. That's great that they fixing up the neighborhood on paint jobs and all that. That's a blessing. But what about the people who homes are affected once they start shift in the dirt?'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Segway I got my name is Tammy Bennett and I am immediate neighbor on two on one for you eighth street. I'm nervous because this is very dear to my heart. What's going on? I let you know where I'm coming from.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am very proud of my city. I'm proud of the work that all of you have done, especially tonight with approving the development of the Forest Park. I moved here from Northern California just to go to Cal State, Long Beach, go Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I. I am proud of where Long Beach has gone. I'm proud, Mayor, that you have been working really hard with all of us, with the river uplink as well. I agree with Richard, who commented that the forest that will blend with my neighborhood at the Dominguez Gap.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do not agree that this project will blend with my neighborhood and the Dominguez Gap. This I have gone to all the neighbors that at all the neighborhood meetings that I had mentioned. I went to the scoping meetings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have studied the reports, kept up communication with the eighth District Council office, made public comments, reported code and ordinance violations to this city. That has happened with integral communities. I have attended the public hearing. I've been speaking up and I have searched through the legislator appendix and findings that you all received.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I am not confident that what Ed says they've been trying to work with with the community. It's not showing up for us. We we want to know that off site traffic studies will reflect what we brought up as a community of the scoping meetings with the width of the streets, all the streets in and out of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that area. My my neighborhood does have a distinct character. It has the eucalyptus trees that line the perimeter of the property. They sway in the breeze. They attract the birds who live near the Dominguez gap, and they absorb the noise pollution from the metro line, the Union Pacific Freight Lines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are blowing their their horns last night, mid midnight, mid-day early morning. The buffer zone that they want to put here with this particular project has only 20 feet high. Freeze. They will not. If I fear they will not give the privacy to to my neighborhood and keep the the the quality of life that my my neighbors'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and I have been able to go. I want to be proud of of my neighborhood. I, I deal with the blight. My neighbors and I deal with the blight in and out. We use the Go Beach app to get the trash cleaned up off of the 48th Street berm Union Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to know what you would be proud of. This project doesn't reflect that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I'm a resident of the second District, but I'm the elected chair of the Sierra Club for the 11 cities in and around Long Beach. So I represent members in all the council districts. You guys got a letter a few weeks ago from one of our volunteers, Justin Ramirez, suggesting that some other things happen with this property because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach has been such a leader with union issues as well as environmental issues. We were surprised that this didn't call for a union labor to build these things, but also that we lost an opportunity to be environmental leaders here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are developments going in in a lot of neighboring communities in Southern California that require for large developments like this that they have solar on the roof, that they have gray water, drought tolerant landscaping. I heard tonight that the developer is gifting drought tolerant landscaping to the neighbors to to buy their, you know, support for the issue'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I'd like to see some drought tolerant landscaping on this actual development. Maybe some other environmental components like, oh, I'm sure increased insulation that that would require less air conditioning and heating in the seasons if they did more than just the bare minimum that's required by law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's a lot of things that with a large development like this, whether it's 60 some odd homes or 130 that you guys could have this really be an example for what transit oriented development. Make a special bus stop there or as well as just environmentally responsible development could look like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I hope you guys will maybe search through your emails and look for that letter from just a Ramirez. It had a few ideas, I'm sure there maybe even some more. If you guys want to make that, hold that to the same standard that like Signal Hill and Irvine are now doing for large developments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And I know that often Sierra Club is painted as opposed to development. And I just want to make clear that we're not opposed to development. But we have spoken out at council meetings before in opposition to the development that has a significant negative impact on the environment, on the quality of life of residents, on developments that don't'",
        "'speaker_10': 'have redeeming qualities in terms of environmental mitigation, affordable housing, other criteria that we as a city hold are important and developments that have terrible precedence in terms of land use, in terms of secure, in terms of the environmental impacts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And this project hits all of those. And so I won't repeat comments that have already been raised, but I think that, um, we're very concerned about the way this project has been moving forward, and we hope that the Council send it back for further consideration.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Also, just to echo comments that were raised earlier, I think further vetting of projects like this, especially at this scale, we haven't seen a project of this scale, a residential project in many years. And we have a great Sustainable City Commission with a lot of really great expertize, and we'd love to see projects of this scale come'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, I'm Joel Weinstein. I live in District eight. I walked out to this site just a couple of days ago. I drove to the Gateway also to get a real feel for this. What strikes me is that what you're being asked to do tonight, the whole list is illogical.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're being asked to designate a new zoning. When this is not even part of the menu that you're able to do legally. And then later you're being asked to approve this new zoning citywide. There was a comment, I think, from his body that no, it really wouldn't apply citywide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if you look at the language, it would it just is that apparently her department doesn't intend to immediately invoke its provisions because there aren't projects immediately in the pipeline to apply it to. Now, if, in fact, you think you can pass a new ordinance for which there's been no due notice, I think you have something to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'think about. The process is probably illegal and is for sure illegitimate. It is unfair. There has been no public discussion of a citywide policy. Every call, every call to these hearings emphasized that this is about River Walk About or Oregon Del Amo Park about that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's no clue to residents except that there's no clue to residents of the city. What's really at stake? It's citywide. Now, is the news possible new zoning a good idea? Well, I think if you look at this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, first of all, the new zoning is a catch all because it's not only R.P. 13, it could be R.P. anything. In other words, it's total flexibility, which is regarded by the proponents as a good thing. Actually, you have zoning regulations not to permit total flexibility, but to have constraints.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So really, this is kind of an anything goes new zoning with a particular case of our P 13. And you see what that case may mean when it's played out at this project site. This project essentially has been designed as a high class ghetto.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It has a one gate. I'm on like the planning documents of ten and 20 years ago in the city, which said, let's have higher density, but let's put the residents along transit corridors and business centers so that they can be well-served by good public transit to get to their jobs and they can patronize businesses there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not it at all. Rather, what it reminds me of is my father's memoirs. When he came to the USA. They passed through Warsaw on their way from the Ukraine and they lived for a couple of days with relatives in a Warsaw tenement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One gate served hundreds of people. There were tenements and then tenements and tenements. And of course, 22 years later, that became part of the Warsaw Ghetto. That's sort of what you're acting for if you go with this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank your next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not a public speaker. So I wrote this down. My name is Diana Drew, and I live at 116 West 48th Street. Um, our house is directly adjacent to the proposed development that would literally be in our backyard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we chose our house, we chose it for a lot of reasons, one being the privacy that we had. The Boy Scout Park was back there filled with acres of trees and it was really nice. But things change and we all know that they're going to change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Boy Scout Park is not there anymore. That land is going to be developed by somebody somehow. So. We need somebody that's going to make it better, not worse. We think that with this property going in, this development going in, it's going to increase our property values.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not going to decrease them. If this doesn't go in, somebody else will come in and maybe they come in with more townhomes. Maybe they come in with condos, maybe they come in with lower income. And that decreases our property, but it also increases the crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This group has come out into the neighborhood. They've gone door to door. They've talked to all of us and asked us what we need. Some people answer, some people don't. Some people like to complain. There's nothing I can do about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But they've asked us. They've helped us. I don't know what more we can really ask. We want our neighborhood to improve. We want our area to improve. They want our area to improve. It seems like our goals are kind of the same.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is it a perfect plan? No. You know, is ever going to be happy about it? No. But considering the possible alternatives that are out there, I think it's a good plan. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Laurie Angell. I live at 458 East Platt Street, which is probably within a half mile of the of the development in real estate. It's location, location, location. Now, I don't have a problem necessarily with density. The problem with the density of this project is where it's located.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's no easy way in and out of that neighborhood. If you picked up that piece, that parcel ten acres and put it elsewhere where people could get in and out of the neighborhood be a completely different story. So it isn't being adverse to density.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been adverse to that level of density in an area that you can't get in and out of. So it doesn't really belong there. That's the problem. So what you need, you need to reduce the density of that project if you're going to have it there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Otherwise, you're introducing lifelong problems to that neighborhood that's going to impact them for the rest of their days. It's the it's the wrong thing to do. The parking is inadequate. I mean, they don't have driveways. You just have to park in your garage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did notice that there's a little street parking, but I can hardly see it at all. We were told there's no significant impacts with parking, but there's going to be 1200 increased trips per day through the neighborhood. 1200 increased trips.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the city doesn't have a standard, so it's no problem. The city doesn't have a standard, so it's no problem. Are you kidding me? We're going to allow the increased traffic because the city doesn't have a standard for that and there's no way to mitigate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's going to happen. So so what my suggestion is, I mean, I was part of redevelopment. We bought the property for for Oregon Park. We want Oregon Park. I worked on that for years and years and years. Don't do Oregon Park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Don't do the level of improvements to that neighborhood that you're doing that is forcing the developer to have that level of density in the neighborhood. Don't do it. We'll do the park some other time. It's a wonderful little thing to just put in front of you, but the cost to the neighborhood and the individuals and the safety'",
        "'speaker_1': 'issues on the street are overwhelming. So talking about alternatives, the only alternative we got was 131 units. That's our alternative. Give us an alternative that works better for everybody. So the city and the developer have been working on this for two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we got was a fully baked, baked plan with. Absolutely. I mean, you know, the incidental public input that you have to do for these plans without any real anybody really listening to us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Josette Sangria, and I live on D.C. Avenue for eight, six, six D.C. Avenue. And thank you for your time tonight. Pardon me for my vocal chords. Not really functioning well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm perfect. No problem. I'm sorry. I said you sound perfect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, thank you. I was here on October 15th, and tonight I would like to continue on supporting this project. I am very excited. And for my children who grew up in Long Beach and who also received scholarships, not to underestimate the schools in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, we have a motto at home that anywhere you go, anywhere, any place you go, the first teachers are the parents. And it is the teaching at home and the discipline at home that helps the children grow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So and we have been to the other in a city in Carson also. Of supporting the project long before the Home Depot. And we were other ground breaking also for that one because we wanted our children to grow in a community to to be part of a community where sports also are emphasized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this park here in Oregon would welcome the inner cities, too, to give them a chance to make their minds busy. A lot of teenagers, a lot of young people growing up and we know the fact that there are so many, you know, broken homes due to addiction, all that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we want to integrate our children the education itself. And not only that, sports, too. And for this project, it has really. Given our community like we are? Well, I have been there almost 20 years, and I don't even know some of the some of the residents there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now it's uniting our community. And it's I think I'm very, really excited and want my children and my grandchildren to be proud that I'm a part of supporting a project like this. Because my children grew up and they had scholarships in college and in tennis, and now they're successful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And now they are also looking for homes in Long Beach. And my other daughter lived in San Diego, moved back and she's she looked at a change and she wants more change, too. And this is a big change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm so thankful for the Riverwalk homes and the developer. Thank you so much for your time. And I am here to support every every step of the way for it. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Daisy Avenue is.'",

        "'speaker_14': 'Mature trees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to lose your peace and tranquility to two. Two. Two and three storey homes will have a negative, negative impact to my family. The developer's efforts to reach out to the community are well noted.'",

I'm Eric Garcia and my name is Virgil and I live in DC Avenue and between 40 and 49th Street and I live there since 1999 and I'm here in support of the Riverwalk project I'm supporting is because this is the continuation of the beautification of the not Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'It's virtually done by your ex-mayor and you as a mayor right now that you're doing a good job in the not long bits. No indication of the alley and the not the Long Beach volleyball road. And the reason why I'm supporting this is because the not Long Beach now is losing a lot of businesses.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'One hope is that we lost the arts, we lost the rails, we lost the harbor paths and all those small businesses in these buildings and not Long Beach Boulevard. You can see a lot of vacancies, a lot no tenants now.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'But because of this Riverwalk project, this will help boost the surrounding businesses and all the restaurants and all the gasoline stations and everything will benefit from all this Riverwalk project vacation. You can see the beautification. They really help get behind the surroundings of the Dixie Avenue, Oregon Pacific and about eight and 49 Street.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And this is this will continue the beautification project of Long Beach Long Beach mayor and and and others. And I can I can see the big picture that this will really help boost the air and the value of the homes in the surroundings.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And also, you know, the traffic that is normal here in LA, in Southern California is it's always there, this tropical wherever you go, especially on grass hours. And I'm pretty sure this project, city project will have a solution to those.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'That's why they're putting a traffic light. And I also emphasize I think this is better than the leave. This land, idle and useless is better. They have something in there, it's gasoline. Or you going to have a beautiful park where they put the people around the area will benefit and it's good.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And the Del Amo that all those cars passing by will see the dedication that's going on in the area. That's why I'm here in support of this project. I can see the big picture and I know that this is will help a lot of things in the area.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. My name is Luke Halsey. I reside in 4956 Daisy Avenue on the list on this address for 60 years. To me, it seems like this project is being rushed through by some special interest groups who want to make some quick money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This project, in its present form is too big for the area. The three story home just don't fit in fit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The streets in this area. What they said before falling apart, they need to be dug up. The slurry seal doesn't do the job also and it is too much. Traffic on these streets is ridiculous. And also. Maybe by losing development, who was looking at a rusting railroad, bridges all full of graffiti and everything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that bridge was built in 2002.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And has never been painted. I mean, what an eyesore you and and see what else to do to the project. This development is being cut back by at least a whole bunch of homes. I don't know the exact number.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Daisy Avenue would have to be made a one way street between.'",
        "'speaker_7': '49th and Alamo northbound.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Only because two way traffic is a disaster. Coming down the street is just too narrow. And also as far as the park goes. What are they going to do about that park being a magnet for crime, gangs, trash.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Graffiti and everything else out there that's going to be fenced.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Off yet to have a post, a guard, 24 hours a day there, that just could be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A magnet for crime. And also when we.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'know, the proper outreach, the idea of permitting and in fact, encouraging to the point of creating a special zoning designation for a land use form we do not want is baffling. We do not want high density development in most of Long Beach as one of the reasons we live here rather than in downtown L.A..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is because even though we are an area with a high population, we are spread out. And that's what makes Long Beach the great city that it is. This would be great in the area surrounding city hall, around city hall.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This proposed ordinance might make sense where New could replace some of the old, severely outdated projects that do not provide parking and basic necessities like laundry area recreational amenities. Ironically, though, this is probably one of the few areas in Long Beach that other areas in Long Beach that this will encourage to have high density development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Gaslamp District down in San Diego. There was not the high density that we got with the cracker box houses, and those areas have been able to be restored and regenerated. This is going to set the precedent where, again, like some areas where we have the cracker box houses, I've done property management.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'genetics. It was this. We rely on our city to develop infrastructure, to develop the environment we're going to live in, to determine the kind of people and the kind of city we're going to have in the future. And genetics determined to be irrelevant.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And we embarked upon a new strategic planning process at Tenet. Most of you might not be aware, but we had a tenant at will J read a long view private school that at its peak at 225 students in it and that closed in 2008.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so as we went through that process, we clearly carefully evaluated all our facilities for current usage patterns, future use of patterns, deferred maintenance, and also what could be a replacement of usage. And we'll do a read scout part kept on coming to the top of our lists to be evaluated in an effort to preserve the site'",
        "'speaker_9': '. We worked with nearly a dozen groups, including private schools, other youth groups and community organizing organizations trying to preserve the property. In 2011, we brought in the Trust for Public Lands, a nationally recognized land conservation group. TPL worked for a year and a half to form a coalition to purchase and operate the site by the expiration of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the contract in 213, TPL was not able to garner enough interest for a public access facility, and so we decided to put it on the open market, and now that's where Indigo Properties purchased it. So what does that meant to us and what does that meant for the Boy Scouts?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The sale has allowed us to invest in our other properties. We lease RC based on a Naples Island. We own a square mile in the mountains, and it's given confidence not only for us to invest in those properties, but confidence for donors to invest in us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have completed $200,000 improvements at our base and we put $1,000,000 into camp targets and we use very little from the proceeds of the sale for that. That's all come through donations. In addition, we've raised an additional $2 million towards other projects with an eventual goal of 5.8 million to invest in the sea bass in our current'",
        "'speaker_9': 'service center. I think that the ultimate thing that this will mean is more families for scouts, more families, schools, more families for businesses, and plus a new park. And I hope that you approve it. Thank you.'",

This year, the city of Long Beach ranks as 18th in Park score out of the largest 75 cities in the U.S..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It would have done better if not for the fact that the size of a median park in Long Beach is a mere three acres. Tonight, you can lower our rank by eliminating a park that is three times the medium size by rezoning it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The chairman of the Long Beach Planning Committee mission, Mark Christopher, stated, quote, This property is too valuable not to develop. I asked the council today. Have any of you researched the cost of the city to transform ten and a half acres of already developed land into parkland?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is it even feasible? Excuse me for disagreeing with Mr. Christopher's shortsightedness. Earlier this year, tens of thousands of Long Beach residents went without power for five days. Let me repeat that. Tens of thousands of Long Beach residents went without power for five days.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This was followed weeks later with another lasting three days. Have any on this council or the office of the mayor considered that this outage was due to the strain of an outdated infrastructure and the continual development of the downtown area in the last few years?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'During the Planning Commission meeting. When asked about the additional load to the existing grid, added Gallagher of Integral two communities flippantly replied If everyone's power will be off when the system is taxed, so will those in this development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tonight, the Council will vote on the countless health, social, environmental and economic benefits of Parkland to a community council member. Austin. Is it your legacy to be that of the council member who thought parks are overrated and not necessary and that cookie cutter homes as ubiquitous as fungus which paint the landscape of Orange County, are more valuable'",
        "'speaker_5': 'than our health, wellbeing and safety. How about making this land the crown of the divorce wetlands about which you so enthusiastically spoke earlier? Where do your priorities lay? I ask that you reject the rezoning of this land from you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Ray Gavlak, eighth district. And I'd like to ask if you would please listen for comparison. The following Long Beach parks are close to the same size as will Jay Reed, Ramona Park, Martin Luther King Park, Mother's Beach, Los Cerritos Park, Golden Shore, Reserve and Cherry Park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're all between seven and a quarter to ten and a quarter acres. Now, imagine these parks tucked away in the corner of an underserved neighborhood with ingress and egress limited to only two locations onto these currently overburdened and narrow streets, streets that have not been maintained and are beyond being able to be fixed with.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'On the opposite border of this enclosed neighborhood is the Gresham housing project that was built to support Section eight housing needs. The other two borders are the lovely Dominguez Gap wetlands that serves our residents with a quiet, open space opportunity.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'The Dominguez Gap residential community itself struggles with poor property maintenance, crime, parking issues, abandoned properties and narrow streets. These descriptive words were used at the Planning Commission meeting by people that spoke in support of the project. I'd like to say kudos to the developer for providing exterior paint on dozens of these homes, fixing gates and yards to'",

Daisy and Pacific are defined as the main entrance off of Delano Boulevard for this proposed development.'",

You were elected to improve quality of life for our residents, not support negative development that isn't even from our city.

        "'speaker_9': 'My homework is kind of. Now let's say it's much less. I talked to Al Austin. Of course, he's a politician. And I talked to Ed Gallagher, who's essentially a salesman in this situation. But I like what they say.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I believe them. And I think that the good guys that are trying to do what they can. In the situation. It's not a good one. I mean, there's a lot of. There's a lot of downside to this, but they paid $6 million for this ground.'",

And if there's more development in this area north of the railroad and an improvement to the area, I would really like that because it increases the value of my property where I stay right now.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'All for the Riverwalk.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Project and there's some mitigation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Actions perhaps that have really been touched on, like traffic and parking. But I'd like to thank the the lady Diane, who, who has been explaining a lot of things to the about the project to me and I. I think it's a good project and I'd like to endorse it.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening and thank you for your service to the community. My name is Carol Beery and I own a residence at 48th and Daisy. I'm in opposition of the proposed 131 unit project due to the impact of such increased density on the neighborhood and streets that are well below city standards for width.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our 13, 13 homes per acre. That's dense. Yes, the developer has had many meetings, but several of us have been opposed all the way. I've seen how they're improving properties in the area to buy approval and bussing those people into this meeting and last month's commission meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Regarding density, this small quadrant neighborhood is mostly single storey residences, yet the developer proposes 131, two and three story homes. These homes are to be three and four bedrooms. HUD states that there is a two person per bedroom policy which indicates actual occupancy will be 6 to 8 persons per household.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, the developer has stated that there will be 2.82 persons per household. This is a 29% understatement of all impacts. Why has this number been skewed and understated? Parking. The developer proposes 131 homes with two car garages and no driveway parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have indicated that there would be 40 guest parking spaces. The developer stated that they do not anticipate outside parking of the development as each residents will have a two car garage. However, the number they have used for vehicles is two vehicles per household when the national average is 2.3.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why has this number been skewed and understated, and how many? Two car garages do you know where 2.3 or even two cars are actually parked in them? There's not nearly enough parking provided within this development. These extra 100 plus cars will have to park in the nearby neighborhoods streets that are already crowded with vehicles at night and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on street sweeping days. What will happen on weekends and holidays when residents have guests for parties and family gatherings? Regarding the roads, why was the fact that there are substandard streets, substandard side streets leading into this project omitted from the report?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For example, Daisy is only 30 feet wide and Oregon is only 18 feet wide, according to the standards published by the University of California at Berkeley. Recommended street widths are 36 to 40, with 32 being the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Minimum for two sided parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Regarding traffic, using the national average of 2.3 vehicles per household at two trips per day, this equals 524 additional in and out trips per day on these narrow streets where vehicles already have difficulty passing one another. The condition of the streets is poor and the winds are substandard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Unsafe conditions for residents and pets will ensue. With this increased traffic, how would even.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Emergency vehicles access this development? The E.R. E.R..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is flawed and biased and should be rejected because the facts are distorted. Why should zoning be altered to accommodate? Thank you, Bill. This project would set a terrible precedent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'MAN Time. Time is up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Time's up. West. 65 homes instead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Actually, sir. Mr.. Good to hear your next. Mr.. Good to hear your next note. This gentleman's lesser. Mr.. Good to hear your next. Okay, then just come up. He wanted to use less of mine, so go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll be brief. Before getting to my overarching concern, just let me say I share the thinking of Reagan-Bush, of Joe Sabo and Cantrell, and particularly the gentleman that spoke of it reminded him of the Warsaw Ghetto, which comes close to what I was thinking when I looked at that picture.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I said to myself, that is certainly, certainly a very fantastic design and looks very good. That would be ideal in a third world country where they would probably, unfortunately, have to put 10 to 12 families in each one period.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There is no question this issue puts. Not only the current head, the councilperson for the district has been, but the entire council on a war footing with the rest of the city. If you've tried to follow this paradigm, period.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it should be cut down, but at least by a third. But I want to now turn to something that you really never even that nobody else has mentioned. I don't think you've thought of the impact that this is going to have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If this goes through and particularly if it if it seeps out to other districts to have on the hotel business and the tourist business, on the business to the the attendance of the aquarium and the Queen Mary. Think for yourself as a parent, as a family member, would you take your family to a city?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where there's obviously something in the tap water, that ginger, this type of damaging thinking period, it makes absolutely no sense. And indeed it does put you on a war footing. I hope you realize that. And I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's not just in the ninth District, that's across the city. And that's particularly true combined with the head up the rear decision of having a building here on Ocean Boulevard with having only requiring one parking space per unit period.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's just there is something in the tap water that needs to be addressed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Final speaker.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hello, I'm Richard Gutman. I live at six of 2/37 Street and Wrigley Heights. It said that you would even consider allowing this property be built upon. It's one of our last open spaces along the L.A. River. It could be purchased or even taken by eminent domain for a few million dollars.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm sure you claim we don't have the money yet. You're able to spend hundreds of millions for a new civic center without making a serious effort to explore retrofitting the current city hall. I watched this item recently when it came before the Planning Commission, over 250 residents signed a petition opposing it, and a number of people came'",
        "'speaker_9': 'down here and spoke against it, presumably, and uncompensated, just wanting to preserve the character of their neighborhood. I don't think the same can be said for all of the eight or ten who spoke in favor of this project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The developer admitted he planned houses. He painted houses of 23 residents and worked on over 30 homes to improve the neighborhood. Tonight, he gave even larger numbers. It's nice to have the homes fixed up, but this is little different from giving money in exchange for support.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So as for executives of individual communities illegally contributing $750 to councilman, you're on this officeholder count. One $750 contribution is the legal limit. The council member returned the money. But are we to believe Integral Communities just gave him $3,000 out of the goodness of their heart?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What bothers me more still is that you're wrong. It's like councilman and this same developer is trying to buy the oil operators highly contaminated property in my Wrigley Heights neighborhood, and he wants this same zoning planned unit development to build more sun cracker box homes there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have an email I obtained on the public records under a public records request from Amy Bodak, in which she suggests that this same zoning be used in oil operators, be used on oil operators property in my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The proposed ordinance states that the purpose of a planned unit development is to reduce or eliminate rigidity in traditional development standards. This is contrary to the very purpose of development standards. It does make more money for developers, though.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'After reading this proposal that this proposal allows houses only 16 feet wide, I made it my own homes frontage. My house is pretty small to 112 square feet, but it's 36 feet wide. A 16 foot wide house is ridiculous.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our neighborhood of standard 6000 square foot lots was the first outside of Belmont Shore, Naples, where the city allowed homes to be built on 2400 square foot lot. Please go take a look at what was done to Golden Avenue, north of Ward Road before you vote on this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These two 400 square foot lots are neighborhood records. No place for kids to play, nowhere to park cars. And they are unbelievably narrow, 25 feet wide, but still wider by five feet than those in this proposed development. The late.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Start times.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Say one more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One more sentence.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the late Ray Robinson accounts for our district, told a developer who had built them, you built substandard houses on substandard lots on a substandard street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Okay. So we've we've closed public comment. So now the the appellant has an opportunity for a couple of minutes of rebuttal or additional now serve you you use I believe 13 minutes of the last. So if you can just keep us to two or 3 minutes, that would be ideal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'll keep it really short.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Just a couple of definitive things to say. The I've heard some negative comments on several issues and we want to clarify some things. For example, the use of artificial turf on the park is that was what was the city wanted.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And we can go either way on that. The gentleman just spoke, said something about 16 foot white houses. That's completely incorrect. That's not true. And I think that the education, the school we like, the schools, I mean, sure, they could get better, but they're not.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'They just got bad. For some reason, I don't understand it. And for the gentleman who spoke about worrying about if his house is going to fall down, if we do anything on that site to cause damage to houses, we will fix it.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I urge you to read the nine letters of support that were delivered earlier. And then there was one comment about about union issues. Well, all the public improvements that we're doing are all going to be paid by prevailing wage.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So that will foster the the union involvement. Um, and I think one of the ladies mentioned that we should have drought resistant landscaping that's condition 12, that's requiring of the subdivision drought resistant landscaping. So I just wanted to bring those things clear so that the council understands that some of those things weren't quite correct.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, sir. Okay. So we're going to go back to the hearing. At this point, we closed the public comment portion as well as the hearing and do the deliberation and any action from the council. Before we get into this portion, I just want to remind the body that there are a series of motions if the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'council goes in that direction and that the the city attorney has well has laid those out. So those are what's what's in front of us. In front of us. So at this time, I'm going to close it out back to the council and go to Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I really want to take this opportunity to thank the many residents who came out this evening to speak either for or in opposition to this. This project has been noted that we have been the city was first notified and the sale went through a couple of years ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so this is a been about a two year process. I met with many residents. There have been a number of community meetings in living rooms at the local park. You know, we've we've we've had, you know, impromptu meetings throughout the community on this particular issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've heard from a lot of people. And from the very beginning, I think I was I was clear to everybody because I thought that this this project brought opportunity for for the community, opportunity to bring people together. What I'm seeing here this evening, I would say that that was successful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I see people from this community that have never been to city council meetings. I see people who don't know or didn't know their neighbors prior to the conversations and discussions about this project and the the mitigations or the impacts that it would have on their neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so with that. In mine. I think we made some progress. Residents, I got to tell you that I'm a bit my tongue throughout this this process, because I heard some very disparaging remarks about what I believe is a great community with good schools and good people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, I took a tally throughout the public comment and, you know, there were about 29, 30 speakers here this evening. And, you know, and I think there all the residents were coming. I want to thank all the people from outside of the neighborhood who have an interest in this as well, you know, because this is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your city as well. But I'm really listening to the residents who live in this community. My ear is there because I said that from the very beginning. There's been a lot of not a lot of opinions is a lot of misinformation has been you know, there have been political agendas, obviously, associated with this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, I've been very. Patient and I've listened to everybody. I was out walking the neighborhood just last week. I wanted to do my due diligence in terms of listening to the residents, not hearing about it on social media, not hearing about it, hearsay, third party, but talking to residents at their door.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I had an opportunity to talk to some of you even who spoke this evening. My Italian residents who live in the impacted neighborhood. Seven were opposed. Eight were in favor. This is a split community. This is a split community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, the jury is it's not clear whether or not one way or another we oppose it or in favor of it. And a lot of people are indifferent in talking to them. They were indifferent in that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we can mitigate traffic, if we can, we can deal with that. The issues that that are that are obvious, you know, we can do that. And they would be in favor of it. I would I want to just say that my mission as a as a council member, I mean, I walked I've talked to many residents'",
        "'speaker_4': 'over the last three and a half years. My mission has been to upgrade uptown, right, to improve the quality of life in our communities and to take advantage of opportunities that are in front of us. And I see this as a rare opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to walk through the the brief history, because I think it's very important to put that perspective for everybody at home. I think the Boy Scout executive director did a good job of it, but I'm going to recap some of it and Will will get read was a ten acre park gifted to the Boy Scouts of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'America in 1941. And it served our community and served the scouts for many years. And during the mid 2000 there were some talks between the city and the Boy Scouts for a possible land swap for the city to obtain.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will J read? But nothing was ever worked out. And I'm sure I mean, we had some speakers here. We had a former council member here who has some perspective on that to tell us why. I don't I'm not exactly privileged to all of that inner city staff who can tell us more about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had a long meeting with our former city manager, and he had some perspective and background on this this property as well. In 2012, the Boy Scouts voted to put Wil J. Scout Park up for sale due to financial difficulties and maintenance costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In July 2nd May 2012, when I took office, the Boy Scouts voted to accept a purchase offer from 4.8 million from the Trust for Public Lands. However, the Trust's Trust for Public Lands still had the opportunity or had to identify partners to finance the acquisition as well as to operate and maintain it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The terms of the purchase contract with the Boy Scouts provided the trust for public lands. Nine months agreement to find the financial backing. The TPL then contracted. Contacted the department. Water replacement district. I'm sorry. The County of Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The City of Long Beach, and other public agencies to request funding partners, but not nothing was available to finalize any agreements. Keep in mind, I'm in July 2012. At the time, TPL was asking for funding. The city of Long Beach had a structural deficit of $17.2 million, requiring major cuts to our police, fire, parks, libraries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In other city city services. The balance our brothers budget. The city, unfortunately at that time did not have the money available to either purchase nor maintain that property. The county wasn't interested. The Water Replenishment District. Was loose, loosely interested, but there was not the the the the the the agreement or the the ability to really put together'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the resources to purchase that property. And I can tell you that I was privileged to at least five or six meetings during that period of time with TPL as well as other agencies to try to make that happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In April 2013, the Boy Scouts voted to deny the request of the TPO to renew their option agreement and instead decided to put the property back on the market for sale in October 2013. The Boy Scouts voted to sell the property to Integral Communities for $6 million.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This was a private land transaction between the Boy Scouts and the developer. And I will just emphasize that enough. I can't emphasize that enough. There's a lot been said about, you know, keeping it park space. It was never park space.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you look at the maps of greenspace and parks based in the city of Long Beach. Well, Jerry was is not on there. It's clearly not there because it was public. It was private land and always had been.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In November 2013, after Integral Communities purchased the property, my office received some calls and emails from for residents adjacent to the property who concerned about the cutting of some trees and what the plans were for the property. A coordinated meetings with the residents immediately adjacent to the property with integral communities to discuss the site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Integral Search subsequently initiated separate meetings with residents near the property. In the spring of 2014, Integral Communities submitted an application and site plan to the city for Riverwalk. In September 2014, the notice of preparation was issued to the city for an environmental impact report, and there were two public scoping meetings held, one at Shire Park and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'other at duly elementary school. The Planning Commission held three sessions and a hearing on this issue before voting on their recommendation to the City Council. And I met with many neighbors on several occasions. Like I said, I walk the neighborhood and I talk with many people who live in the neighborhood about the proposed park project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And before I get into some additional comments, I'd just like to ask a couple of questions which I've heard from residents this evening just to get some clarification. And for city staff, I heard a lot of express concerns about losing privacy, particularly those who live on 48th Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to clarify. I think I heard it. I want to make sure that I'm clear. Will there be any three storey homes in this development immediately adjacent to these existing homes?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember asked. And the answer to that is no. We actually have a requirement in the project that the homes abutting the 14/48 Street northern boundaries be two story. We also have a requirement that there be at least a minimum of a six foot six inch block wall, which can be increased to eight feet in height if that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is desired.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, guys. No one can be asking questions from the audience, from the audience, or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A fan staff discuss some of the potential projects or issues that can be addressed with the $100,000 traffic medication fund that is being proposed for the development. Let me just be a little more specific as well. I know there was a there was a lot of conversation about the Meryl Streep Daisy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was out there walking the other day. One of the speakers, Mr.. Mr. Causey pointed out. And we were talking in front of his house and, you know, he made a great suggestion that this be studied as a as a one way street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would that be something that we could look at using that plan to do?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Certainly the concept of a traffic mitigation fund was used very successfully in the Douglas Park Development Agreement, whereby the city was able to utilize the funds to address very specific traffic issues that were raised by the development of Douglas Park that were unanticipated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It allows the city's traffic engineer to be very site specific and very responsive to the needs of that immediate community. It is absolutely within the purview of the city traffic engineer to utilize those funds for those purposes. So certainly if a study needed to be conducted and it was determined that a one way street couplet or a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'one way street pattern was most efficient and desired. Yes, absolutely. That's something that could be done with these funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And another concern that was was pretty consistent was the fact that that that particularly residents who live immediately adjacent to the property or around the property were concerned that people or residents in the property would be parking outside in their areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm sensitive to that that concern. I'm just curious whether or not we could look at preferential parking. And I think we can. Obviously, I think that's something that we can do. But I'd just like to get staff response on preferential parking, the possibility of doing so at a later date.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is also something that is is readily applicable to this mitigation fund. So if there is that a preferential parking district does require a survey and a certain petition process, certainly these funds could be used to go through that process and determine if that is warranted and if it's desired by the immediate community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I met with several residents on 48th Street who said their homes were built on a former dumpsite. Can staff address the research found regarding that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Certainly, as Joe Pera of Rincon indicated earlier, through the secret process, we scoured the state databases and have not been able to find any evidence of a landfill. Further, when this issue was raised at the Planning Commission, we went to a separate landfill consultant that the city has worked with in the past, who also did a database'",
        "'speaker_6': 'search and can find no evidence of any documented landfills in that area. That's not to say that the that this area might not have been subjected to illegal dumping or to improper compaction when the residential tract was developed in the forties and fifties, that there is no evidence of an actual landfill having ever existed on that site'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Thank you very much. So I understand that there are many different opinions on the project. Many residents I spoke to in the neighborhood believe the project will be good for the neighborhood and they like the project. Some residents overall like the project, but have specific concerns, are issues they'd like to see addressed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think some of those have been addressed through the mitigations proposed for the project. Ultimately, I must weigh all of this input and these opinions to decide what I believe is in the best interest of the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For one, this is not city property, but private property. The city had the opportunity a few times to acquire their property, but that was never realized, whether because of fiscal limitation or other factors. It's a land remained in private hands while it was undeveloped.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When it was owned by the Boy Scouts, it was never a public park, nor was it publicly accessible open space. We have a lot of open space, by the way, in a district. The biggest open spaces is not publicly accessible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's actually a country club. We have open space in the Carlitos housing. We have seven acre urban farm there. There is a lot of open space. We voted this evening on 39 acres of open space for for native habitat restoration.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a lot of open space. And yes, this is private development, ten acres. And we're going to get three and a half acres of public park space. I'm weighing this out and I'm having a hard time seeing where this is bad for the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As the Planning Commission chair, Marc Christoval, said last month during his hearing. To believe that this property would be remain open space forever. Is is really a pipe dream. It's not not feasible. I want to remind you comments from earlier from Councilmember former Councilmember Val Lerche, how long it took to find the forest wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So three decades. Are we really, really, really willing to wait that long to do improvements in this neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, guys. First of all, we can't go. We can't do like this. I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. This is private property is going to be developed as residential. So. Watch this. This takes us to this particular proposal. The quality is, I believe, a quality proposal. As a development services director is indicated, the homes are of quality design.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is a quality development that will be a complement to the neighborhood. In addition, the development includes a development agreement that provides many community benefits to the Dominguez Gap neighborhood. Most notably, the new park at Organ and Animal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I was first walking this neighborhood running for office a few years ago. And ever since then I've been asked by numerous residents in the direct neighborhood and around the neighborhood when we when are we going to build this park that we were promised seven, eight years ago?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The land was acquired by the redevelopment agency and was supposed to be built with read about development bond proceeds. But that money ran out and we no longer have redevelopment. So the city does not have the funds to develop the park at any time in the foreseeable future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is an opportunity, folks, that I don't believe will come again to build a new city owned park that will be well-used by kids throughout the neighborhood and throughout the community. I think there are great benefits to having a park there with active recreation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've said on many occasions, if you go north of the four or five freeway, you have very limited active recreation for our youth in that community. This park will serve a need when I say active recreation, soccer. Rugby football.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Things that keep our kids running. That bring families and communities together. The development agreement also assures that several streets in the Dominguez Gap neighborhood will be repaved. 48th Street, from Oregon Avenue to Long Beach Boulevard. 49th Street from Morgan Avenue to Long Beach Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Daisy Avenue, Oregon Avenue to Pacific Avenue will also get repairs. And I know some of those streets need more than just flowery silk. I'm not I wasn't born yesterday. I've been I mean, I've seen the conditions of the streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've driven the streets. I've walked the streets they need for grind and overlay. And this is why I've asked for an amendment or further conversation on this and to give our public works director the ability to approve whatever improvements are going to be made there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll be making my motion. The request. I'm sorry. The development agreement. Also, there's a $100,000 traffic mitigation plan that we've discussed. I've also heard from residents that they want to explore having some sort of streets become one way because of the narrowness of the streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think we've addressed that and will address that. Others have asked about having speed bumps. This mitigation plan can be used to study these measures and implement the necessary traffic improvements to address some of these concerns. It's not a perfect neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not a perfect development. It's not a perfect situation. But I think this is with almost $4 million in public improvements that are going to be directly into this neighborhood as a result of this project. There's something very difficult to walk away from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Plus there are additional public safety and school impact fees that will be going toward these services. Some residents who live adjacent to the property have expressed concerns about losing their privacy. With the new homes right next door. And we as we've established, there will be no three story homes up against homes along 48th Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also ask that the perimeter wall be eight feet high rather than the proposed six and a half feet, and that mature trees be planted along the perimeter of the property adjacent to the homes. And if we can preserve existing trees, I would ask the developers to look at that option as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No one can be for sure what the future holds or what the market conditions will be a year or two from now. We certainly did not see ten years ago being in this situation. We didn't see five years ago being in this situation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we have a unique opportunity when all said is done. I believe this is a project that the city can be proud of. The community can be proud of in the neighborhood with new homes, a new park and new streets, as well as 39 acres of wetlands just across the Llano will be much better off.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So council members weighing in strong support of this project and would ask that you join me in approving it. And there are a number of motions that I would like to to read. Two. But should we take it from the council first?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I think what we'll do is if you I know you've you've made a motion or there's a second by Councilman Richardson. I think on the first the first part of the motion, I'll go through the members that are there, whether cued up, and then we can go to that vote and then go through the votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So just to keep this organized. Next is Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, councilmember austin. I think your outreach to the community and I've heard from neighbors who you knocked on their door personally. I actually ran into one last night and they think that that's wonderful that you've continued to keep that connectivity with the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate that. Even after a presentation from Miss Bodak, I heard from the community in public comment and perhaps they prepared their questions in advance of the presentation. But I just wanted to ask two or three questions really quickly, just to once again confirm what I had heard earlier in the presentation and what you and I'",
        "'speaker_1': 'had discussed earlier, which is come to the attention of our office, that there is misinformation out in the community, and we just want to correct the record once again. Ms.. Modak, does approval of this project exempt any other development in the city from going through the necessary approval process, including Title 21 zoning within the Long Beach Municipal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Code?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, ma'am, it does not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And will the development project in the eighth District at DC Avenue impact any other current or proposed or future projects?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, ma'am. Each project is determined and verified on the basis of its own qualities and characteristics.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that, and I know we've discussed it several times. And the final question, which was very specifically called to my office on numerous occasions today because of misinformation in the community. If there is, for instance, an existing parcel in the fifth District that's zoned institutional.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does approving tonight's list of items from Mr. Austin grant an automatic zoning change for any of those properties?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Categorically no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I really appreciate the amount of time you've spent on the phone with constituents across the city. I want to thank my staff for fielding the numerous calls and properly informing the community. There's a process for a reason and there are no secret projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The words are there. To inform the community and engage the community. And I hope that we can all stand together and talk through the fair process that we have in in knocking on doors and talking to the community and getting involved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank every single person that came here tonight, because it's really important that you came to voice your opinion. And thank you to all of those who called to get clarification, because you didn't think that Councilmember Austin or any other member of this council would try to be deceptive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're really here to move the community forward. And I want to thank Councilmember Austin for his leadership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I took a lot of notes and sort of have been following this here recently and just the start. I think this is just a tough position for the city council one way or the other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I would love to say that we should acquire Jay Reed, invest that money, expand open space. But the reality is it's we're just in a position where you have to find an opportunity to expand open space and other places.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think, you know, there's you know, this is this is seems like you're taking a difficult situation and making it creating a win or dilemma. Park Oregon Park looks great from the renderings. So, so I'll just start by I'll just applaud all the residents and the Boy Scouts for coming out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I got a history lesson tonight on the history of all the efforts the Boy Scouts made to try to preserve that space. Seems like they went through the right steps, but it wasn't it wasn't possible. So I just have a few questions based on things I've heard tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. When my residents in North Long Beach were very close to this area and including myself, I don't live very far, just the Long Beach Boulevard. When we think of parks and open space parks and recreations, historically folks haven't thought about Will J.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Read. Was this ever open? Was the site ever open to the public for recreation use?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not to our knowledge. It was never considered a public park. The city has not used it as a public park. The city has not maintained it as a public park. Certainly it was available for special events and the Boy Scouts had a number of events, including overnight campgrounds, camping at that location.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm sure that there are a significant number of people in the community who have had access to wheelchair read in the past. But it is not and has not been publicly accessible to the residents of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Is there now? I know that we're in the process of identifying, opening space and building new parks and trying to figure it out. And, you know, a big part of this is funding. And that's why it took so long with the de force wetlands opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is there funding available that I'm not aware of that the city has at this point to acquire the site and develop it into a park?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would leave that to the city manager or the assistant city manager, to my knowledge. No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Oregon Park site. What is the current development plan and timeline for that? If this isn't approved, including funding and timeline.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If this is or if this if this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If this is not approved, we do not have any funding lined up for any portion of this project. It would still be owned by the former successor agency and now the city of Long Beach. But we do not have any identified funds for the construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the event that we cast a vote in support of this project. What is the timeline for park construction?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The timeline for the park construction is concurrent with the overall development of the residential homes. Grading of the project site would be concurrent with grading of the park site. The developer would be required to deliver the park site prior to the 33rd issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the 33rd home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the city would then enjoy the warranty maintenance period on the landscaping. And then the city would need to accept the park for use maintenance and essentially the rights to use the park and to maintain the landscaping by the 67th certificate of occupancy for the residential.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We were very cognizant of the the need to ensure development of the park since that is a significant benefit to the neighborhood and we wanted to ensure that that would be done prior to completion of the residential project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it sounds like when the project's halfway done, 67th occupancy permit is when we take the park back over.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And how long is that going to take?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would say that the developer is best able to answer that somewhere around probably 18 months or so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So an 18 months or more park can be open.'",
        "'speaker_6': '18 months from, I would say, grading? Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there were concerns I heard about the traffic on the Alamo. And I know that like I take the Alamo pretty often and the traffic is pretty bad, but and it's the same way on Artesia and Artesia, we're doing a master plan to look at active transportation and things like that, to try to make sure that people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who want to connect to the blue line station that's right at the Alamo. And what is that Santa Fe think? It's the Alamo. Santa Fe. They have access. Are there any current, current designs or plans with the blue line station?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would ask or to connect to that. I would ask the council member or anybody else, is there something in the works already to add, you know, bike facilities or something on Alamo?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not that we're aware of. Certainly there is on Artesia, as the councilmember is aware, there's an effort by the Gateway Cities to do a significant multi-jurisdictional project on Artesia.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is is since you're building a park on Artesia, is that something the developer can can work on?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Developing the park at Oregon Dilemma.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I mean, since we're building a park and we build bike lanes or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would defer to our bike coordinator to see what sort of master planning efforts are currently in the works in that area. I'm just not versed enough to be able to speak to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to know. Do. Okay. I guess I'll get that answer and some other point and then preferential parking. So I know that. What was it? Maybe three years ago, we created a new ordinance for construction related preferential parking that didn't have the the whole elongated timeline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was supposed to be immediate subject to public works on if there was any sort of construction related impact we could utilize this this tool and I think we've only utilized it once is our would that be a tool that can perhaps help mitigate some some of the potential parking impacts or perceived parking impacts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Certainly during construction? Absolutely. In addition, there is a requirement that there's a construction management plan for the project that will also mitigate the impacts of the construction vehicles in the neighborhood as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then as you know, I represent Long Beach on SAG as well. And every city in the region, including Long Beach, has been issued RINA numbers addressing housing needs. What is what is Long Beach is most immediate housing housing need as indicated by by okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So sag hands down and allocates numbers to all jurisdictions within the region and are required arena numbers which stands for regional housing needs assessment is a little over 7000 units that we need to be able to have appropriate zoning for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They break out the arena numbers into different categories are very low, low, moderate and above moderate income units. And of that 7000 and change arena number, our biggest need is for above market rate residential housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that what this is?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of our total arena numbers of 7048, we are required to have adequate zoning to accommodate 3039 above market units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are these above market units?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, they are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this helps meet that requirement that every city has, excuse.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Me, above moderate income units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the shrinking the sinking street stuff. Is there anything written in to make sure if anyone's house sinks? We don't think it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Certainly the developer has offered to deal with those issues if they are found to be the responsibility of the developer. Certainly on site there are absolute requirements from a geotechnical perspective and a soil compaction issues to ensure that the site is capable of withstanding this construction and that we don't have these issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So from my from my standpoint, you know, to conclude it earlier, earlier today, we talked about the forest wetlands, huge open space opportunity. It took 30 years to get to get there. And what I see here is the Boy Scouts have tried to do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now they've come to the city and was able to help us figure out how to add a park that we have no strategy to build at a park to North Long Beach, which the city hasn't even figured out how to add more parks in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this the Boy Scouts and the developer has figured that out. I think that's something to be acknowledged. And and this is a good thing that in 18 months, we're going to have new open space in terms of Oregon Park and the forest wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's and I think that's something to be to be recognized. I know it's I know it's a tough situation for everyone to be in. But I think that the key word here is diligence. The Boy Scouts have done their diligence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The developer so far seems like they've put out like a open call saying, hey, what can we do to help to fix it? So from my standpoint, I think this is a project that I'm going to support and encourage the council to support for the sake of open space in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. For the purposes of transparency, yes. Integral did give me $750 for my officeholder account back in earlier in the year, January or so, before I knew that they were involved with this project. And when I found that out, I gave it back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also gave back about another $3,000. A letter from other donations that potentially might put me in a. Conflict of interest situation. So I'm listening. I hear it. I'm trying to do the best thing I can as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not welcome when there are aspersions thrown at not only at me, but at my fellow council member when threatened with a vote. I mean, we all have an important job to do here, and it's not easy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The easiest vote for me to take today would be to say no. To say, let's leave things be as they are. Let the open land stay open and undeveloped and become a blight to the community. There was a comment made earlier today about maybe we could use eminent domain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Eminent domain went away with redevelopment. So that is not there. It's been mentioned before, and I will re-emphasize that again. The Boy Scouts did a stellar job in trying to do the right thing. They put it for sale.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No takers. They put up for sale again. There was a taker. It's private property, folks. And when it's private property, the property owner has a right to do what they want with that property. There are other properties in Long Beach that are going through the same process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's there's property. The mansion that was also mentioned by the same gentleman who put a price on me on that. That, you know, we had the oil properties out there. The oil properties has been a vacant land for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oodles and oodles of years and nothing being done there. You want to keep that there. Keep smelling that oil coming out of there. Instead of when you can have a developer come in, clean it out and make something beneficial out of it that would benefit the city and benefit the residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I spoke with Integral about the project at hand. They are a responsible developer. They are. They've offered to build a park, which is part of a community benefit. And when a company comes to me and says, I'm going to give you a community benefit, I'm listening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not totally about the development itself. It's about giving back to the community. And that's what they're doing. It's a responsible way of being able to develop a project that is going to be welcomed and that is going to benefit the community more than it's good that will be there if not developed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's that's the option. If we don't vote for this tonight, what are we going to have an empty lot? If I don't if we don't do anything with the oil property, what are we going to have? Another empty lot?'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Typically when we are working on a development project, we are obligated to work within the existing state guidelines that only require us to ask for improvements that have a direct nexus to the impact from the project. In this case, because we are entering into a statutory development agreement, it provides the city a much greater level of flexibility'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in focusing on that nexus, and it allows the city to ask for additional things that may not be directly related to impacts caused by the project. So in this case, because the developer is asking for a statutory development agreement, we had the ability to ask for much greater level of improvements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If this had been a a zone change and a general plan amendment. Without the development agreement, we would not have been able to ask for the extensive park improvements or a number of the street improvements and.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Conclude that we've done a good job in terms of the city's position of of getting the most public benefit with this project that we can under the circumstances?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, ma'am. I do feel very comfortable with that. I have been involved in the other two development agreements in the city, and we have received quite a bit of benefits from the Douglas Park Development Agreement. And it's to be seen what we will get out of the Golden Shore Development Agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this one also has a number of public benefits that far exceed our abilities normally to get these type of benefits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I may have missed this during the presentation, but what is the anticipated square footage of the plan one and plan to homes?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the houses range in size, but the average square feet of a house is about 2500 square feet with a two car garage. Okay, so the units range in size from 2100 square feet to 2900 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know there were some comments about personal speculation about sales price. Has any of that been determined in terms of what the price per square foot might be in this area, what the fees might be, anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's not within our purview. So we don't get involved in that. That's purely a market issue. I don't know if the developer has those pricing available or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to you know, I know this is not an easy decision specifically for Councilman Austin. I want to thank him for his leadership because he's really taken the time. I appreciated his presentation tonight and his talking points.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Report from Public Works recommendation to find that excavations are immediately required for the general health, safety and welfare of the city and provide and approve a discretionary permit to excavate in Santa Fe Avenue between Pacific Coast Highway and Willow Street Districts one and seven.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. All right. I just had a question as to the outreach. For the businesses that are out there and then what the timeline will be as to when it will begin, when it will begin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Honorable Gonzalez That's a great question. We have asked Tesoro, who was the oil company, who is the owner of this pipeline, to have a 24 hour phone line available for any questions. And also, they have told us that they will be notifying all the residents and businesses when they start or when that comes to to do this'",
        "'speaker_4': '. They've told us or guaranteed us that they've done this numerous times in the last ten years, that they had no problems. The way they do it, nobody will notice it. And it has minimal impacts to all the residents and and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember, you're on. Good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In regards to frequency, though, how often does this occur?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are you talking about the frequency of the holes or half when they do this to us?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does the company go about doing this kind of project?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're telling us that they need to do this every three years. But at the same time, when they drill these half inch holes every ten feet on center, they're going to fill it with materials that it's strong enough.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But also they don't need to come back and we re drill it. So they're going to use the same holes, the locations, and be able to probe it. So the material they put in will be able to to have their probes basically penetrate that material and detect their pipeline if they're sound or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, should they find a major issue with any of those pipelines? Is it going to be their responsibility to either repair it and replace it or that the street would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct if if in doubt in a case like that, if they find that they need to repair the pipeline, they still need to get a permit from us. And in that instance, we can impose conditions to fix the street to our new standards, which is slurry sealed from curb to curb.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since this condition that they're working in doesn't constitute that. It's it's very minimal and there's no nexus. We cannot ask them to do that. But any time they open the street with any kind of trenching, then we can ask for not only to fix their pipeline, fix the trench, and also fix the pavement on top.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, I'm assuming that you have a map of where all these pipe pipelines will go through the city, correct? Correct. So when they do their these projects, they tell you in advance what areas they're going to be going into units on some of these holes to check on their pipes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, they they need to have a street use permit whenever they are in the in the public quite a way to perform any type of work. The reason we are here tonight before you is because of the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These two streets had slurry seal in 2014 and paving in 2010, 2013, I believe. So they're within the five year moratorium. That's why they're here. Usually drilling a half inch hole would not constitute the staff bringing this item before you because there would be past the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the answer to a question is yes, they will have to get a permit from us to utilize the public right away. We have to make sure that they have proper traffic control devices so traffic can go around their activities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we approve those traffic control plans ahead of time for issuance of the permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's why I'm bringing it up now to turn to the disruption that it might have in the neighborhoods and to the businesses along that strip. So. Just want to make sure that those individuals who are affected by it are well aware of what's taking place and why, so that there's not a pushback from neighborhoods and businesses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that say, why are you doing this again? Especially within the within them that that period of time, that five year plan. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",

And coming from a district attorney's office that has been a statewide leader in cold cases and cold case investigations, I think the new technologies that are available in the forensic field today and available to law enforcement are really going to hopefully help move this case forward.'",
