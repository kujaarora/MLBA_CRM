    "Appeals and Approval of 320 Alamitos Project.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you and thank you to all that were involved in our presentations today. We're now moving on to the rest of the agenda on the city council. We have a long agenda, so we're going to start with like we always do our hearings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have one hearing tonight, and that is a hearing on 320 Alamitos. And so I'm going to begin the hearing and just in just a minute. Okay. I can please have the city clerk please introduce the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hearing item one is a development is from development services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, concluded the public hearing and considered third party appeals from Long Beach Citizens for Fair Development, a resolution finding that the 320 Elevators project is consistent with the Downtown Plan Program, Environmental Impact Report and subject to the Downtown Plan Mitigation, Monitoring'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and Reporting Program and uphold the Planning Commission's decisions to approve a site plan, review and lot merger for the construction of a seven story 77 unit residential development at 320 Alamitos Avenue in the Downtown Planet Development District, District two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And before we move on, I was just asked just because there's a lot of folks here that are not here for the hearing. And so just from from a timing perspective, the hearing is going to come up, which we just started, and then we will go right into the items for the evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those that are here for the Innovation Center item that's at the top of the agenda. We're going to go right into both the issues on equal employment and language access and the recreational pot issue, which I think we're most people are here for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those will all be taking at the start of the regular items. And so we'll try to get through the hearing as expeditiously as possible and then we'll get to the other items as well. So thank you for the reading of the of the hearing item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I could turn this over now to Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We will hear a staff report from Kari Tai, our current planning officer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor Garcia and members of the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is an appeal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of the Planning Commission's approval of this project as a site plan review for a 77 unit residential development at 320 Alamitos Avenue in the downtown of the Downtown Area Plan Development District 30. The project is located within the city's downtown plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's on the east side of Alamitos Avenue. There's an aerial on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The project site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Serves as a private surface parking lot. You see this on the larger side here. And then there's a smaller parcel that currently has the billboard on it. Sometimes it has a medical center billboard, and right now I think it has Honda on it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then those so those two parcels comprise the project site. Surrounding properties include an auto repair facility, a four story residential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To the east there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And auto I'm sorry, auto repair and small scale commercial to the north. So that's across fourth street. Across the street from the project site on Alamitos is a professional office building and then to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The south is a commercial building that has a that has their surface parking lot right on the corner. And this is going to follow with some photographs. So this is the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Surface parking lot. It's currently leased.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To, I guess, monthly subscribers through.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'An Internet site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Photograph of the site that has the billboard on it. So about the project. The proposed project is a seven.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Storey residential building. It would contain 77 dwelling units based on the downtown plan parking requirement. 97 parking spaces are required and 108 are being provided. I think the slide says 105. However, since the appeal was logged and since this presentation was prepared, there has been a refinement to the plan where three additional stalls are actually located on'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the on the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the, in the garage.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And therefore, please note that correction the unit mix includes four lofts, 29 studios, a 31 bedroom unit and 14 two bedroom units. And basically the configuration of the building is that the parking and then the ground floor uses take up the first two levels and then floors three through seven are the residential units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are tenant tenant amenities included as part of this building, including a roof roof entertainment area, basically a roof deck and a community room, as well as private open space in the form of various balconies, patios and terraces.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that is a combination of common open space as well as private balconies for the units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is a site plan that's on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Note that it is oriented with the north to your left, and so Alamitos is shown at the bottom. There are two site access points for vehicle for vehicles. One is from Third Street, the other is from Alamitos Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Due to the there's due to the linear nature of the building that the two access points really.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Facilitate the circulation and usability of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The garage.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One thing I'd like to point out while we have the site plan on, is that the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Building is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Really oriented toward the Alamitos frontage. There's a this is the seven story portion, and the portion on Third Street is a slightly lower at six stories. And there is a significant rear setback.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Courtyard on the top of the second level. And so the really the building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Units all set toward the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Front and the courtyard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is what is directly adjacent to that existing four story.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But multifamily residential.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Building. So to talk a little more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'About the building itself, the architecture of the building is a clean, modern esthetic with pedestrian oriented ground floor spaces, and that is intended to continue to establish a connection between pedestrians on the sidewalk and passers by on Alamitos.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A to the actual actual building. The building exterior materials feature wood stained laminate panels, a gray metal panels and smooth stucco framing elements. There's a substantial amount of glazing to afford, a lot of openness to the building as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I did talk about the building massing. And this this particular rendering shows that the building is up toward Alamitos. But in the plans that were included in your packet, there are different renderings and there is a point of view that shows the courtyard as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The building also incorporates.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A number of sustainable green building features, including efficient mechanical and lighting systems. The actual exterior materials and window systems are also included to better insulate and better for the building to meet the green building standards. Cool paving and also drought tolerant landscaping per the Downtown Plan program are mitigation measures which this project is also subject to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The project must exceed.'",
        "'speaker_7': '20% increased efficiency over the current building code standards. And so that does include having solar ready for the roof and also any other energy efficient measures that power the building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lastly, a shade and shadow study was.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Prepared and included with your plans. All built proposed buildings that are 75 feet and over in the downtown plan require a shade and shadow study as part of the follow up environmental review for the Downtown Plan projects. This project is actually under that 75 feet threshold.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, the Shade and shadow study was done nonetheless to show whether there would be shadow impacts on the adjacent building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the features of this building was.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was to orient the massing toward Alamitos to minimize any shadowing effects on that adjacent apartment building. In terms of downtown plan consistency. The project complies with all of the downtown plan development standards and by development standards that means height, floor area ratio, open space parking, etc. This this includes actually meeting and exceeding the required parking by'",
        "'speaker_7': 'one space. There is also the added benefit of having the billboard on the corner removed, as the Council is aware. There has been an effort throughout the city as a whole to eliminate non-conforming billboards and ones that are not in compliance with the city's current billboard ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that would be one of the benefits of this project as well. With regard to environmental review, the downtown plan included the program Environmental Impact Report that analyzed the impacts of development of development within the Downtown Plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Downtown Plan EIA programs are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'New about what development intensity and development density would be anticipated, but did not know what the actual form or configuration of the actual development projects would be. And therefore, every project is subject to some level of follow up environmental review.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That environment environmental compliance checklist was prepared.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And found that the project does not have any new significant impacts that were not analyzed by the downtown plan either.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And therefore the project does not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Warrant further environmental review. With regard to the Planning Commission's initial action on August 17th, the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on the project. There was a public hearing and the majority of the public spoke in opposition to the project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Within the ten day appeal period.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Two separate parties have filed appeals and I should note that the two parties consist of. One of them consists of multiple people who the names are listed on the screen, but I will not read them. And the and the appeals contended that the project conflicts with the downtown plan and that the project introduces environmental impacts that were'",
        "'speaker_7': 'not identified based on the environmental compliance checklist and the analysis of the program, EMR, as well as the compliance with the development standards. The staff finds that the grounds for the appeal are not warranted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Based on the project's consistency with both the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Downtown Plan, Development Standards and compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. The project was found to be in compliance, and therefore a staff recommends that the planning the City Council uphold the Planning Commission's decision to approve this project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that concludes my presentation and we are available for any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much for the presentation from staff. And so we do have comments first from the applicant. So Mr. Mes, do we have are we doing 10 minutes for the applicant or are you doing 15? Okay. So we'll do our we'll do 10 minutes less as a request for more time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will do 10 minutes for the applicant, which will go first, then we'll be then the appellant. I believe there are the two separate appellants. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Mayes There's two sets of appellants, but one of the appellant groups listed a number of people. I think there's six altogether. I don't know if they're all here or not, if they're or if they are appointing a representative to speak for them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And so what we'll do is we'll do we're going to do one the applicant then one of the appellants will go. We'll go. Then the second group, which is a group of appellants, hopefully they have assigned someone to speak for that, for that group of appellants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if that's something different, please let the clerk know and we'll try to fix that if that's not the case currently. So we're doing the applicant ten minute, 10 minutes applicant 10 minutes, the appellant another 10 minutes of the second appellant Then the applicant gets a rebuttal of about 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Three or 4 minutes, is that correct? That's great. Okay, so why don't we begin unless there's any objection to that from those that are and that are the appellants. We'll move forward with that process. And the applicant, please, can come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Three. Thank you, Mayor, and thank you for all the council members that's present over here. My name is Justine Lagarde and I'm the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Owner of the Arrow, the given. I'm sorry we didn't take an oath for first, so let me make sure we do an oath for everyone that's going to be speaking. So, Madam Clerk, can you do the oath for everyone that is going if we are one of the speakers tonight or if you're going to comment, please stand'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and raise your right hand and take the oath from the clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You in each of you do solemnly state that the testimony you may give in the court now and pending before this body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Why don't you go and begin again? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. And thank you all the council members. My name is Justine Lark's body and me. I'm the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Proud owner of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': '320.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Kilometers vacant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Land. And I'm very, very proud to present the whole project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We think it's one of the great project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is going to be making the Long Beach. You know, I know all those areas and everywhere else. It's got to be something that people will be looking forward to. Look at it, look at the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to give it to Michael Bond and he can explain the project and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll be still available over here to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Michael Bond. Thank you very much. Good evening. My name is Michael Bond. I'm a senior principal with Studio 111. We're an architecture, urban design and landscape office. Just a side note, we just found out this week that we are not only LEED Platinum as an office, but we are also now, well, gold, the first architectural office on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the West Coast. And we just won an award for office, which gets us to 20 awards. Ten of them proudly, I can say, are in Long Beach. But with that, this is the plan that shows in the black rectangle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our site you can see two circles. One is a five minute walk, the other one is a ten minute walk. And what we what we've learned is that and academics have said that a five or ten minute walk is something if it's a good environment that people can go to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So within a ten minute walk, we can get to the blue line. We also had done some research on Watch Walk Score, which if you're familiar with, is a third party that analyzes the site and determines the walkability bike ability and transit ability of somebody living there and how they can move around without a car to create'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or to fulfill their daily errands. And on this particular site, the walkability is 94, which is actually a walkers paradise. From a bike mobility perspective, it is an 87, which is it means it has excellent bicycle infrastructure. And from a transit perspective, it is a 77 which is still determined as very high.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that, we wanted to look at show this diagram here and on the ground floor, as the city had mentioned, we do have a very active ground floor and located in orange here. There's a fitness center at the corner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a lobby, we have leasing, we have a bike, kitchen. And then at the other side, as you get closer to Fourth Street along Alamitos, we do have lofts for lofts that are on the ground floor to create a very active edge, which cars just cannot provide when you're a pedestrian in the downtown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also, we have a rooftop amenity located up here with great views of the ocean and the East Village as well as Alameda Speech. We have open space on the roof with great ocean views for all the residents. We also have another deck on this side and then, as was mentioned earlier, a podium down below.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you take all the square footage of those spaces, we actually are close to double the amount of open space that's required for this project. We are not asking for any variances in terms of parking. We are required 97.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are providing 11 more stalls for a total of 108. Another way to look at it is if you provided one parking stall per bedroom, we would still have an extra 17 parking stalls for guests or spillover within the development itself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a view looking north on Alamitos, a third street. You can see the ground floor is very glassy, very open, very inviting for people walking along the street. And then we did step the building closer to third down a floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can see a little bit of the amenity room up above. But it does step down and step back from the adjacent residential area. And then this is a view looking south on Alamitos. We did pull the metal in the front building as a material to relate in an abstract way to the Villa Riviera metal roof.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then you see the balconies and how they are faceted and they actually relate to the circular tower, which is not really a truly circular building. It's actually faceted if you look at it closer. And that's known as International Tower.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we wanted to play off those facets and take advantage of the views down Alamitos towards the ocean as well as northward. There is a lot of wood material to bring warmth to a very contemporary building and to make it more attractive for the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is the courtyard that was mentioned. On the left side is the taller portion of the building. It's four storeys high. We have a 35 foot wide courtyard and then a ten foot gap between our building and the adjacent building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So from the new residents living on the left side to the existing residence, there is a distance along most of the site of 45 feet. And then walking along Alameda southward, you can see the live work units on the left side or I should say loft units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then as you walk further down, they're activated by the other uses, like the bike kitchen and the leasing office and lobby. And then finally we have a section here that's cut east west. So on the left side, you see Alamitos.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as was mentioned by Kerry, the highest portions of the building are on Alamitos, so that the math does not minimizes the shading on adjacent buildings. You can see it steps down one floor towards the eastern side. And then there is a significant, as I mentioned earlier, 45 feet from this wall to this wall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That creates an open space between the two buildings. And with that, this concludes our presentation. We think this, as I mentioned earlier, it conforms with the downtown plan. Our city, our region, our state desperately needs more housing. And this is going to be one project that could provide some assistance in that issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. With that, we have our two groups of appellants. Our first first appellant, Mr. Borowski, is here. And we're going to go ahead and allow or we do want the other appellant group to go first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Sure. Then we will have our other appellant request, which is a variety of folks, and we'll set the clock again for 10 minutes. Whenever they begin, we'll we'll start.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And members of the City Council. Yes, it's me. I'm here representing our our H-2A, which is lost on fourth. And we are adjacent to the building, but we're across the street on Alamitos. We have some comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We we prepared a PowerPoint for you guys to show us art, show you our perspective on this particular project. But before we do, I'd like to thank Councilwoman Gonzalez and peers who have spent time with us to sit down and listen to our concerns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And with that information, we've been able to prepare this PowerPoint.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. My name is Bebe Jimenez. I'm on the board for the Locks on Forth Association. I'm here representing the appellants Tino HARAMIS, Karen McGinley, Tetsuya Hashimoto and Kazumi Harimoto first item. Let's go ahead and begin who we are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who are we? We're long term neighborhood stakeholders. We're homeowners. We've been in this neighborhood, in our building since the beginning of redevelopment. Our building was built by redevelopment. We're residents who chose a friendly neighborhood close to the downtown core, but with an easier pace, a little bit slower.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're supporters of compatible development. We support projects that respect our neighborhood. We're not NIMBYs. One of the appellants is a real estate broker. I've worked on both the public and private side of residential development throughout my career, and we support projects that follow the rules.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm drawing your attention now to the downtown plans. Our opposition to this project really is rooted in the downtown plan. We see that as a good based document that allows for reasonable development that sensitive to our neighborhood. The downtown plan says that good design usually results from projects that were conceived in their total and respond sensitively to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'their immediate context. The following standards and guidelines underscore design principles intended to produce good buildings, great streets, and memorable places. Standards per the downtown plan standards identify requirements. Guidelines should be addressed with all development projects. Alternatives will be permitted only if the intent of the design guideline is met again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Standards equal requirements are issued relative to 320. Alamitos specifically relates to standard number two new buildings should respect the scale of adjacent structures and respond to their elements in an appropriate manner. And number three, new buildings should be bold and innovative and promote a forward looking identity for downtown Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Architectural design standards or design guidelines are also included. The applicant proposes a mid-rise design. We actually think a low rise building is more appropriate for this location. But even presuming a mid rise design, the guidelines indicate that the massing and design of mid-rise buildings should be sensitive to the adjacent scales and carefully address the transition to lower'",
        "'speaker_6': 'height structures that may exist or may be anticipated on the same block. The project fails to meet standard number two new buildings to respect the scale of adjacent structures. Seven storeys is out of scale and inappropriate for this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The adjacent buildings are all low rise. Building buildings, no mid-rise buildings, no seven storeys. Most buildings, again, are one and two stories in height. The project fails to meet architectural guideline that I met, the architectural guideline that I mentioned before, that the massing and design of mid-rise buildings should be sensitive to adjacent scales and carefully address the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'transition to lower height structures. The proposed project is significantly taller, therefore insensitive to the scale of the adjacent buildings. The transitions that it would create would be jarring and abrupt, as there are no seven story buildings or any buildings near that height adjacent to the proposed project site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, this is our neighborhood. The project site is identified in red. This I'm going to go through quickly some slides of the surrounding streets so you can see for yourselves what the adjacent building heights are. This is a northbound view of Alamitos in third Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can see a two story motel to the left and three and four story condos at the Seaside Villas immediately adjacent to the project site. This is a misleading and false context represented by the renderings included in the plan package from the developer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The building to the far left where the arrow is pointed does not exist. The South bound view of Alamitos in Third Street. Again, one story apartments, one story auto repair, two story apartments, one story auto, and a two story motel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again across the street. 38 Alamitos. One story. Two story, one story. Another misleading rendering that's included in the plan package, these two buildings to the far left corner. They don't exist. They appear to give us some dimension and height to the surrounding context, but they don't do not exist.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, here we are at Alamitos and Fourth Street, giving you some more perspective. Again, two storey apartments to the left. One story, smog shop living room is just off the screen. You can't see it, but it's a one storey bar.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sure some of you may have visited it from time to time. To the right is two storey condos. Here's another misleading, misleading rendering showing distorted scale. This is also from the project plans. The Villa Riviera and the international towers are not this large when you view them from this location.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here's the actual photo of that location and look at how far those two buildings are in the background. Once again, we're looking here northbound view of Alamitos and fourth, two storey condos, one storey retail, two storey apartments and retail, one and two story motorcycle and auto, no.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Seven stories. Once again, viewing towards Alamitos off a fourth. One story. One story. One story. No, seven stories. Here we go. West Bound View of Fourth Street. Alamitos. Two Story. 2.5 stories. One Story. 320 Alamitos fails to meet the standards, also that the new buildings should be bold and innovative and promote a forward looking Long Beach identity'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or identity for downtown knowledge. The design is not bold. It's not innovative. Many similar projects look like this in Long Beach. Everybody is doing it now, including Studio 111. It's now becoming a cookie cutter approach. And unfortunately, we have a lot of these now in downtown Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here we go. This architect in particular likes to use a lot of heavy horizontal lines, giving the building, has a lot of heavy massing, giving it a very block like appearance. You'll see this repeated over and over. This is another project downtown fourth and land in heavy horizontal lines, heavy massing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here we are, 1235 Long Beach Boulevard. Heavy horizontal lines. Heavy massing. Another same example at 245 West Broadway. And again, glass at the bottom. The glass lobby seems to be a trend. And here's one from Glendale Arts Colony.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I found this one online also by Studio 111. Look at that. And now here's the Long Beach version of the Glendale Arts Project. Well, shall we look at that one more time? Look at that. Wow. Look at the paneling up there at the right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We just get all the paneling in this version. Right. Okay. So I'm going to try to hurry hurry this up. The site plan review findings, we found some inconsistencies and errors. Errors. Their exhibit C says the design wouldn't remove any significant trees, but it also says that the Billboard parcel contains two mature eucalyptus trees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not sure who decides what's significant, but they're significant to us if you can see them here. These are the two largest trees, trees on Forest Street, probably in the East Village. For us, they're neighborhood markers. They provide character, they soften the corner and they identify this place as our home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also, we talked about shadows study. The shadow study that is in the staff report or in the plans is not adequate. Also, one thing to note, your resolution says that the building is 75.5 feet in height, the resolution you're being asked to approve.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the Sigma document says at 74.5 feet, as does the staff report. I'm not sure which is which, but this is too bad that we're here trying to play guessing games because one automatically triggers the requirement for a Shade Street study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There was a shadow or shade study that was included in plans. It's not complete and it doesn't meet the requirements. It doesn't provide calculations. It's unclear who, if anyone, verified those calculations or verified the shade study is accurate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We consider ourself to be a resident, a sensitive youth staff, and their own secret document says it's unclear what a sensitive use is. We say we're a sensitive use. This photo was taken from a window in our condo complex seven in the morning, October 4th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A seven story building will block our morning sun and put us in the shade. Our building, we consider ourselves sensitive to light sensitive uses because we have large windows, extensive glazing skylights, clear story windows, and it's all designed to minimize the electrical usage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We rely on it a lot to light up our homes without using electricity. In addition, there are other flaws in the secret analysis that was included with the Planning Commission staff report. The analysis indicates that the project would not conflict with any any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. And so I know the time that the time is up on this hour. It is the last thing you want to say to conclude. And then we'll turn over to the second appellant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. Well, I would encourage you to go through and review the rest of the PowerPoint if they're able to send it to you electronically. The project is flawed. It doesn't follow the standards. The developer's going to tell you he spent a year developing the project and trying to come up with a good design.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'During that year, he never spoke to us. If he was smart, he would have spent that year trying to make a project that fits the standards. That follows the standards. It's a tough site, I get it. But there standards in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can go 80 feet. Yes. But if you meet the standards and I think everyone should keep in mind that there's a lot of folks who are concerned about the land use element. And part of their concern is that when things get approved, that the rules that get put in place sometimes oftentimes are not followed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're asking for you tonight to do is to overturn the Planning Commission's approval of the project and show everyone show all of us that the rules will be followed. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Much. Thank you very much. And make it clear, Mr. Brewer, cruise control.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. My name is Warren Lisowski. I represent Lombard, Citizens for Fair Development. Our mission statement is to preserve and protect the architectural, historical, environmental and community resources of the city of Long Beach, and to guarantee that development in the city is carried out in a manner that reflects the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'principles of equity, social justice, responsible management of the public's resources. I would like to thank the other appellant for just doing an amazing job of showing how this project does not conform to the downtown plan under Sequa. And I'd like to continue to contextualize what her comments were about the land use element.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think this is the largest uprising of public dismay in the city, probably since the 1991 riots. We had these meetings that the city held after demands at the Planning Commission's study session when the Planning Commission did not want to recommend the land use element and staff insisted it was going to be presented to the Council anyways'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Part of this anger that surrounding the Louis and this project is the way that the city uses a program, air program each year under secure were not intended to be the end of environmental review for a project. They were meant to be part of a hearing that happened so that further environmental review can be done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the way that these program ers are used by the city is to cease to do further environmental input. Like the previous appellant was saying, if the developer would have simply came and talked to them, they could have made some changes to the development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you'll see that throughout this entire process on this development, there there's been a large amount of community input and there's been absolutely no changes in the project. So what is the community input doing and what effect does it have?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Basically none. When this when this project came before the planning commission, there was at least 30 to 40 members of the community. And most of them, the vast majority of them, spoke against the project and complained about parking ratios.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, if you go ahead and look at the exhibit that was included with the staff report, there's about 40 letters from the public of which 39 of them are against the project due to the lack of parking and only one in support from the downtown business district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a problem with the staff's instructions to both this body and the Planning Commission. The staff seems to think that the Planning Commission and the City Council don't have a choice or say on anything and very often tell the Planning Commission in response to questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You have to approve this. You don't have the right to to disapprove this. And in fact, if we look at the Planning Commission's website, it says that the Planning Commission is does numerous requests from developers for administrative use permit, standard variances, etc., etc..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So these are requests from the applicants. These are not demands that the Planning Commission has to rubber stamp. And in fact, we don't know why. Commissioner Van Horwich The Chairperson abruptly quit in the middle of her term. We don't know why, but she did say at the Planning Commission study session, when the Planning Commission chose not to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'recommend the L'ue maps to the City Council, she said, I'm paraphrasing, are we meant to just rubber stamp this? Do we get a say on anything? That was one of her last meetings. So I think the Planning Commission themselves is sensing some of the frustration that's going on with the instructions being give to them, be given to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'them specifically as it relates to this project. When this project came before, Planning Commission Commissioner Richard Lewis recused himself from the vote. I believe that was due to the fact that he is the principal developer. But if we look at the city ethics guide, it says that if there's a conflict, a conflict of interest on page nine'",
        "'speaker_5': 'could be if you are an officer, director, partner, employee or a trustee or manager of a company with business before you, department or board. Well, he clearly recused himself for a reason. But when you look at page 13.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry, Page. Page 12 when it says, What are the remedies to a conflict? I'm sorry? Page ten, what are the remedies? Abstain from the vote. And also, number two, you must publicly disclose the interest in the subject of potential conflict.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's my recollection that Commissioner Lewis did not give the public or the rest of the commission the reason or his interest in the developer during that recusal. I think that's problematic when when a commissioner recuses himself. I believe it has a chilling effect on the rest of the commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How are you supposed to vote against the projects that your fellow commissioners have an economic interest in? Also on page eight of the city's guide to two Conflicts of Interest Ethics Guide, it says The state law prohibits you from being financially interested in any way in a city contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If your duties call on you to participate in any way or any stage in the approval of the contract. Now, I'm not an attorney, but maybe the Mr. Mayor, the city council might want to ask the city attorney, does this development deal and the conditions of development constitute a contract between Mr. Lewis as a developer and the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'city of Long Beach? So I think it's problematic. I think Commissioner Lewis should decide does he want to be a developer or does he want to be a planning commissioner? That's only fair to the people of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The specifics of this project, I've given you all a copy of a letter that we've written. It goes over the specific reasons under Sequoia Y, the Y in air or further environmental studies are needed on this. And I just wanted to say that, you know, we're here to speak for for the for the people that don't have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a voice. 3 minutes in this chambers is really not enough time to express the needs that the community has. If you look through the letters in the attachments that staff has given you, one woman has a story of, you know, being assaulted because she had to park so far away from her place, from her house, coming home'",
        "'speaker_5': 'late at night. And these stories are just really heart wrenching. So, you know, where do we go from here? We don't want to litigate this. That's that's not our intention. We just want some community involvement and sequel is there for community involvement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so when the city continues to use program ERs to avoid community involvement, other sequel, that's when we have a problem. That's when appeals happen. So we ask this body to send this back to the Planning Commission. And, you know, why is this so important?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just one development. You know, democracy. If you look at Washington, it's broken right now. I mean, we've got our the people's attorney up there lying in front of Congress. And so why is this important? It's important because for the residents of Long Beach, we depend on this body to be our local functioning democracy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We depend on you to be a progressive decision making body that represents the people of Long Beach. And so when you see such a vast outpouring of dismay over the lack of parking and the outsized scale of this building, simply following the guidelines under Sequoia could have given community input and could have made this project more agreeable'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to everyone involved. So I think in closing, we'd just like to give, I think Studio 111 could get one more award and it's the architectural firm that's, you know, least considerate of what the needs of downtown Long Beach residents are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So we have an opportunity for if the applicant wants to give any sort of additional rebuttal closing comments. I think we said 3 minutes, Mr. Mays, is that correct? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is John Mendis. I am the construction manager for the project. I'm part of this project. I think it's a beautiful project and I recognize the concerns that were here regarding parking in the community. And I think we knew coming in that this was going to be a challenging parking site and project because the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'adjacency to a residential area and it's the border of really where the urban part of the city meets the residential part of the city. That being said, it is. That being said, it's Alamitos Boulevard. It's an urban street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we feel the scale is in proportion to what that large wide street carries. The adjacent building is in scale to residential, to low mid-rise, to a taller building. And we're comfortable with that and we believe it's a very attractive, good looking project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That being said, I want to address several of the comments that were addressed that I felt were need to be addressed directly. First of all. I'm the construction manager for the project. I was hired by Mr. Luck's body, Dr. Luke's body.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And our job is to shepherd it through the entitlement process. I am the owner of Share of Ice 100%. Richard Lewis has no financial interest in this project. And I will just say that that statement that was made was untrue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have a financial disclosure with the city as I am also commissioner, and you can confirm that. Secondly, I'm proud of the work that Studio 111 has done in this city. And I think there are great financial I'm sorry, business partner to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think they've done wonderful work there and extremely committed to this city and they've done great work. And I think we need to support that. I think this is a super design and I. I urge you supported this project tonight, and I thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. With that, we are going to go ahead and close the hearing and do public comment, of course. And then and then we will the council. So if you if you're commenting, please come forward now. Well, obviously, we have a long night ahead of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please just give us your your opinion and we'll move on to the next person and we will conclude the hearing at that point. So please say your name and begin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Prophet and I live at 140 Linden Avenue. I've lived in Long Beach since 1975, and I was very proud of the Planning Commission's decision that they didn't want to approve this, but they were told by staff that they had to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's an ugly project. It has nothing to do with the neighborhood. It's not the right thing. I know that you want us to walk everywhere, to bike everywhere, but we have no retail, no viable retail downtown, and we're not going to get it with little pockets of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Businesses on ground floors. At the same meeting where this planning commission did not want to approve this project. They asked that the parking situation be addressed again because let's face it, it's not working. The downtown plan is not working for the people who own property, the people who rent property and the people who do business downtown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is not working. And I know you all want to fidget and not listen to me, but I'm really not happy about that. I've got a lot of notes here, but they're not working out. You have to wonder why Long Beach Development Services didn't want to look at parking options.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a big call because they want to have this program air where nobody is involved in anything in the city where they do everything and they cater to the developers. That is not right for those of us who have equity and we're building too many apartments and not enough condos.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're not going to get people with equity in this city. And that's what we need. People who will come here and stay here, not come and be here for two years until their lease is up and then leave so that the apartment can charge more money.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are lots of questions about this place. But the. Bulk of the matter is it's not good for the neighborhood. You have a clear opportunity here. You can side with the people of Long Beach who don't want this project's height, its density, and its lack of viable parking options shoved down our throats.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or you can do your callous disregard for the citizens of Long Beach and show that you really don't give a hoot about any of us. What will it be?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up next, speaker. Good advice. Mr. dan, I just want to make sure that everyone that's speaking is in the line. So I'm going to close the speaker's list. And so the gentleman at the end there will be the last will be the last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaking lists is closed. Speaker's list is close. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Jim Dan. I live in the Fillmore, a historic district. A couple of things. I promised Kathleen that I would stay on point because there are a lot of items that were mentioned earlier that really upset me from my standpoint here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The key here with the developer and also the people involved is integrity. I have worked with Michael Bond in the senior project in the Willmore Historic District. It was tough because it was an abandoned apartment that got transferred over.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's some pushback. He came in. He was extremely respectful. Every project that he's done is had the utmost integrity. I think a lot of people in this city, this is not Iowa by the sea anymore. They're out of touch on the what the youth is bringing to the city people these days.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm probably the last person among a lot of people here that could actually could afford to buy their own home. People these days are not buying homes. They're not going to the strip malls. They're not buying expensive cars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a different there's riding bikes. They're walking. They're skateboarding. They're spending money on designer drinks. It's great. I wish I could do it. Now, getting back on point. Jordan Davis has worked with us on several community projects. Again, integrity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry, doctor. I don't remember your last name, but your. I applaud you for hiring these two gentlemen and having them associated with your project. Again, integrity. I please. I support this project 100%. It changes difficult. It is the beginning of change for downtown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And again you have to the highest rated people that I can think of that I would want to build my project in Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Mayor and Council. My name is Kathleen Irvine and I am a downtown resident. And I have to say that my favorite part of this project is getting rid.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the horrible billboard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My father was born in Long Beach. I spent most of my childhood here, and I'm happy to see so many wonderful changes happening. There was a very dark period in in Long Beach as history and the newness and the vibrancy of our new downtown is wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was part of the downtown plan meetings, so I approved it. Despite being a preservationist, I approve of all the things that are going on. I love this project. Michael Bond and J.R. Van Dike do great work. Just because you don't care for that particular look does not mean it's a bad thing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do not think it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To use that as a hammer to stop a project just because you personally do not like the color gray or glass or whatever it is. That is not enough of a reason. And to say claim that a building that is across a large street is adjacent is really not correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you look at the dictionary, you would never see adjacent. Define that way. So I appreciate their concerns, but quite frankly, I'm thrilled with this project and I really want you guys to support it and move it forward quickly to get rid of that billboard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Counsel lived in the second district for over two decades and the East Village. Has character. That's why people move into the second district. This architectural rendering is a cookie cutter, and it makes me wonder if it's prefab material.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the other thing, why is it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Only 20% efficiency if their lead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To winning 2020 awards for their architecture and green LEED and all that? Why isn't it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'More than 20% efficiency?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thirdly, again, you guys are greenlighting all of these new constructions. With no parking permitted for the neighborhood that's been there before. All this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Continual development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Started rushing in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not fair. And listening to what was just said what the second appellant with regards to the commission. My goodness you've got you've got commissioners playing both sides of the fence.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's egregious and unethical.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And for you all, if you are rubber stamped us and the community is in such an uproar. What do we have you all representing us for? If if that's the case, we've got five, five council seats up for reelection.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's time, way past time. We're going into the next new year and you got five seats up for reelection and we're continually have to battle. I also want to know what percentage of this is affordable housing, any of it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is all these new constructions going to be luxury buildings? And the majority of the people that are going to inhabit these apartment buildings are not from Long Beach. So how are you benefiting the 60% of people that are here already if you're not offering any percentage of it as affordable housing mandated by the city council through your'",
        "'speaker_6': 'charter, all you're doing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is just luxury, luxury.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Luxury all over the place and the integrity of the second street, the second the East Village is shut. Because that's not what me being on the Arts Council Planning Commission the council was supposed to represent in that village area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's why people move into the village. So I don't approve this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The the the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Seven storey plan, the architecture does not meet the integrity of what the neighborhood looks like.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's going to impact our parking in addition to the other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'New constructions that's going on. And you all have yet to address that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Joe Cross and I am an owner of the Loft, one of the units at the Lafayette condominium. I am also a 15 year employee of the related companies, which is a mega developer with dense urban planning skills.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am in favor of this project for a couple of reasons. One, market rate housing is definitely needed in the downtown area. Okay. Secondly, is socioeconomics. I believe the area median income must come up as well. That will help the city drive the quality retail that we sorely needed in the second district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as well, your goal of bringing more employment to this great city. I think without the housing likely going first, you may not hit those other two goals. But thirdly, and most importantly, I believe in the multifamily concept that it's your sustainability that's built into your downtown plan, the sustainable plan and the city of Delia's plan as'",
        "'speaker_5': 'well. It clearly states in your plan you are going to get Southern California off of the reliance of the automobile. And without a dense urban plan, you're likely not to hit that. And I truly do support that. I would like to take it one step further, though.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As you look towards development in the inner core, with the height restrictions of 250 feet, that you do urban planning that is able to hit a green space development that is not down here to you can easily insert 20% inclusionary housing which is highly successful in the New York City model.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And because these projects are built to scale, you can hit parking ratios 2 to 1 that will pencil out to a developer that just takes a little more for planning and getting over a couple of hurdles to where you're currently at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But truly, I do support the project. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. And I know the gentleman. The end was the last speaker, so I think we added somebody. That's okay, but I'll be the last speaker. No more. No more speakers. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Members of the city council. My name is Toliver Morris and I'm representing downtown Long Beach Alliance. I'm the former chair and board member for downtown Long Beach Alliance. I wanted to put into the record a multitude of letters that we received from people of downtown and all over the place'",
        "'speaker_4': 'residents, business owners, property owners who are in support of this project. This is exactly the type of project we need in our downtown. We need lots of these kinds of projects. I'm in the commercial real estate business and bring retail one of the spear heads for retail in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All the retailers who are coming to downtown are counting on these types of projects. The projects that have delivered thus far, the current and the Edison filled up to over 90% in record time, way ahead of schedule. They're doing great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need more and more of this kind of project. This meets the downtown plan. It also meets with the LBA strategic plan and we are in support of it. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name is Tino HARAMIS. I live across the street from the project and I moved to downtown in 12 years ago. Brand new into the building from sold a house in Belmont Heights in that area. We never had issues like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of a sudden. I love our area because it's a diverse area. It's also in our building. We've got some affordable units that have to the people have to live there for 15 years. It shows stability. I feel that it's really and we had also the the city manager the manager of this company come over and talk'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to us because Janine brought him over and he there seem to be a lot of things he was saying that do not fit into our neighborhood. The first thing he said was the owner bought the lot at a reasonable price, but nothing below a seven building with an underground parking doesn't pencil.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then they couldn't figure out another way to make it more accessible or nicer for the neighborhood. It's called a village. It would bring down the clock. I would move out. If they build, I'll move out. You'll you'll lose one more neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I'm not willing to live in a neighborhood with a big, ugly building in the front that does not fit in the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Village at all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The other thing is that those wonderful trees somebody was talking about the billboard. Well, the billboard. I don't even notice it because I notice the trees. It's fantastic. So so maybe they shouldn't you should not combine those lots because those trees are wonderful and we don't have enough green space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also have to think about the ethical part. We look at the plan. We know it's out of scale. We know they didn't follow the plan. But besides that, what.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About making something that also lets people with lower incomes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be able to live in those apartments? I'm just a man before me. I was just talking about the fact that we want to create more business and make more money. No, we don't necessarily only need money. We need quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need a community. And you know, we voted for you, Mayor Garcia, because you're innovative, you're young, and you probably understand how wonderful it is to live downtown because of diversity, because we also and it's beautiful to live in a neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm Greek in Belmont Heights. People look at me funny because I was playing Greek music here. I can play any music I want. Nobody looks at me funny. We are very diverse. It's fantastic and I want this diversity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wanted to stay. Do you think in this building we're going to be as diverse as we have been or they're going to be pretty much pretty wealthy high earners coming in, bring in maybe some money, staying for two years and leaving again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I like consistency. I love the walkability of our neighborhood. This just doesn't fit. And as the gentleman was saying, I bet you he can find a way to pencil it in and make a lot of money as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we can have a nice neighborhood. I would love to see something wonderful in front of our building, but not a seven story. I pay $100 a year, a little under $100 a year for electricity because I have the light.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't need to use much electricity. I save so much electricity. Now I'm sure my bill is going to go up greatly. So all these things do matter. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I moved into the loft on fourth in 2005 with my husband. We've been there 12 years and it is an absolutely spectacular community. As Tino just said, some key issues that I object to as as not only as a real.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Estate person, but as a citizen of the redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Area, downtown Long Beach, no affordable housing element. I think that just cries in the face of what you people say you're going to do, both as a professional and also as a citizen. I also object to the seven stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The natural light is certainly an issue and the high density impact of traffic is just extraordinary. Already on the Alamitos and forth, and I'm not being rude to the gentleman with regard to traffic. He was kind enough to spend time with us last night, but the road diet isn't working and this isn't going to help, okay?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's going to make it a lot worse. So basically I'm asking to revisit the alum in this project, decrease the number of stories, consider decreasing the number of units, therefore parking and density at an affordable housing. And then you can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Follow the guidelines that you set up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When we started redeveloping downtown Long Beach in the early 2000s.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Debbie Tobias. I live at 100 Atlantic Avenue and I am president of TAPS, a citizens parking group. We oppose the project because it doesn't have enough parking. The city has refused for years to make sure those parking requirements are adequate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Stopping the damage has become an urgent matter. Please get the options for immediate action. Action before approving these buildings. Planning staff is. Following the directives of a previous city council when it comes to the support of the downtown's lowered parking requirements, downtown city councilman Robert Garcia and Switzerland pushed for adoption of the downtown plan, which included the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'low parking requirements. Council members outside of downtown should realize that these issues are likely to come your way. The the Midtown plan was also was already passed last year. That lowered parking requirements without local data or professional evaluation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During the hearing, the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Planning Commission was told that there is plenty of parking in the area. A commissioner disagreed with that statement after driving.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The area at 3:30.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'P.m.. Planning staff also refuses to include parking guidelines in the alleyway, saying parking will be addressed later in zoning. If you think you can deal with it, then consider how little success we've had fixing this. The downtown plans parking requirements for the new.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Buildings were not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Based on data or professional evaluation. Back in 2013, planning staff could not provide anything like that to support one space per unit regulation. For years, seniors planning staff has refused to listen to us the public property managers and owners, business owners, owners, our experienced parking consultant and our lawyers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The only reason there's a parking study coming is because of multiple lawsuits. The California Natural Resources Agency told us that the only way to enforce secret is through litigation. That type of lawsuit requires a great deal of money and time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those at City Hall who want to continue with the inadequate parking requirements know that they only need to continue saying no. The California Natural Resources Agency also told us that while parking is no longer a secret impact, inadequate parking causes, increased traffic, air pollution and safety issues for pedestrians.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because of the increase in cars circling to find parking in the area. The city can study these impacts to protect our area, or the city can continue to do what they think they can get away with. The choice is yours.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This can be fixed, or you can continue with the policies that were pushed into law by a small number of people. Please make sure these new buildings have enough parking for their own use. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. My name is Sharon Brown. I'm here reading something for Becky Fisher. She had to leave. She's at 418, Benito. And basically she says there have been numerous studies done indicating that air pollution contributes to Alzheimer's and dementia and people driving around looking for a parking place contributes to the pollution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last week, Janine Pearce met with local residents to discuss the 320 Alamitos Building. The meeting raised more questions to me than it answered. There are lots of promises made to meet with people before tonight's meeting to provide proof for claims made by staff at planning and council meetings, etc. But to my knowledge, none of this came through'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Someone questioned the height of the building saying it's supposed to be in line with the surrounding buildings. Well, it's now she's tells says six stories that's apparent, seven storeys above ground to the four stories above ground next to it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That issue was not addressed. No one could confirm if there's still losing all the parking in front of the building on both sides of Alamitos as originally planned. Nor could they confirm where the claimed 28 new parking places were supposed to be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So no new understanding or clarification to any of our concerns, just promises that did not come to fruition. So on one hand, you have people relating facts that the issues caused harm to the environment and subsequently people, and on the other hand, people just outright denying facts because they don't want to believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because it doesn't fit their agenda. The agenda seems to be money, money for business, money for people in power, money for developers. But what about the constituents? If you don't take care of us, who does? The Planning Commission tried.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They didn't want to approve the 320 Alamitos, but staff told them they had to. If the Planning Commission can't say no to staff, then why do we have them? If council can't say no to staff, why do we have them?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It seems that staff is naming the city, running the city, and they aren't elected. They're hired. So basically we have no representatives and as such, no voice. And thank you very much.'",

The 77 unit project is a welcome and much needed addition to the downtown area and provides the development of much needed units within the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Acknowledging the need for housing supply, this project supports that end goal for both tenants and our hometown businesses. Supply is the issue and it is encouraging to see so many residential projects in the process. Thank you for this opportunity to speak before you in support.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. My name is Lynnette Firenze. And to approve a site plan review, positive findings must be made. Finding requires compatibility and design, character and scale with neighborhood structure in the community. The proposed building is 75 feet and seven stories surrounding buildings are 1 to 4 storeys in height.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed building is up to six stories taller than nearby buildings. How is this compatible with the surrounding buildings?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The findings don't address the scale, the building approval. The project will result in a loss of privacy, light air and a reduction in property values to the surrounding condominium owners. Most of El Camino speech is 2 to 3 stories.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The new U.S. maps released this weekend show Alamitos Beach went from 7 to 4 stories. This height is more appropriate for the neighborhood. The downtown plan has five guiding principles. Number five is working with and for the community.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'That was very eye opening and I hope the City Council will take that into consideration. I lived in the area for 15 years now as owner of town home, also served on the board of our building for 13 years and I've seen parking go from bad to worse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've seen what's happened with development. I think it's a beautiful project that you have there. I think a smaller project would be much better for the area. I think having the trees there, I think having a little open space is very great there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think not being able to see the sunrise is is really impactful for neighbors. And I think this is going to be I don't want us to be guinea pigs for. What is a larger scale development in a historically smaller, low rise development area?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are a residential area. We're Alamitos Beach or on the east side of Alamitos, where this project is supposed to be. And I just asked that the council take that in consideration. Also, I imagine that people who are going to come and rent in this building are going to be paying at least 1500 dollars a month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think this is going to be low income. And I see that the neighborhood changing and going from more diverse to less diverse. So I don't think that's something that a progressive city like Long Beach wants to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I urge the council to vote against this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you. That concludes public comment. And so we will now conclude the hearing and go back to the council. And so I'm going to turn this over to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I want to. First state. How much I appreciate those of you that are here today engaged in this process. I know that it's been probably the most debated project that's happened in my district since I've been in office, and it is also the smallest of the projects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it's been a really hard time for me because it is a project that's in my neighborhood on the other side of Alamitos, on the east side of the district. That feels very different from being inside the downtown plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so this is not a project or a vote. That is an easy process for me. And I think you guys have seen me publicly kind of grapple with a couple of things. So I want to give a little bit of context for some folks and just set how my mind has been going and then ask a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'couple of questions of staff. I think that, one, when I went through all of the letters, the emails I've received in support and opposed, I had to really figure out what's the majority. And I do want to say I want to thank the community members and yon for joining the District one meeting, which while I would have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'loved to have invited you, I didn't. You just happened to be there. We were at that meeting and we had a meeting last Wednesday and a couple of one on ones as well. And so we've gone through, in my mind, trying to find out how we make this project fit within the downtown plan and how we mitigate'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the impacts for residents. So within the downtown plan, I think the argument that I have heard from from staff is contradictory, but with some of the the valley, the views from some community members, but it is the roles were set.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And when we look at the things in the areas where we have some arguments around if it conflicts with the downtown plan, one of the questions I have is around the height of the building, and that is one thing that I consistently have said is probably our biggest challenge.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I do want to ask development services, if you could talk a little bit about the downtown plan on the areas that we went over previous today around straddling different height densities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Councilwoman Pierce, I'm happy to answer that question for you. The the building that's before you tonight is at a height of 74.5 feet in height at seven stories. And the downtown plan, the sub area where this building is located allows a height of up to 80 feet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the context for that is that the building is located on the east side of Alamitos. And if you look at the boundaries of the specific plan, the specific plan does not divide or bifurcate the downtown plan by use using the street as the easterly border.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It captures both sides of the street so that there some context to the development. And you will note that the boundary of the specific plan goes several lots almost to a full block east of Alamitos. So everything within that sub area would be allowed or would be permitted to go up to a maximum height of 80 feet'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And that's the context for the height. Did you want me to get into the scale a little more?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you could get into the scale around some of the other buildings that are there? The appellants presented some photos. I know to the east of that project is some condos that it kind of steps to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Directly east of the project, we spent a lot of time looking at the context between the proposed building as well as the especially as it relates to the building just to the east and as the developer indicated in their presentation, but staff tried to cover as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was of a particular concern to us. And the design of the building is very context oriented, meaning that most of the height of the building or the heights, the highest components of the building, the seven stories are all oriented to the west of the site along Alamitos.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The the designers specifically did attempt to step the building back at the side of the property on the east side adjacent to those the four story units. So at that side, the of the project is four stories on top of the the the podium again in an attempt to minimize the impact of the height of the building'",
        "'speaker_8': 'on that adjacent property as well. If you look at the top, the other feature of the project to address that the issues of privacy was also that you'll notice on that easterly property line there's a row of trees again to provide some screening and some privacy between the project and the adjacent four story building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the species of that tree are fairly high, so they will grow fairly tall and would provide, again, some privacy on the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you, Linda, for that. I know there's a couple more questions that Councilmember Gonzalez is going to ask before we get to those questions. I also want to give some context, because when I went through District two residents concerns, every single one of them had to do with parking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I absolutely feel that pain. I lived on walnut with no parking. I understand the impacts of that. I want to give a little bit of context. So I'm going to ask Public Works to come up and give a little bit of overview.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We cannot in my minds, while the downtown plan said it's 1.25. And actually, Linda, while you're still there, the downtown plans at 1.25, I did tell tops that I would get back to them in understanding where that 1.25 came from, what was there previously.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so, Linda, if you could share a little bit of that for us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. Happy to do that. In terms of the parking standard, the current standard is one unit per space for each I'm sorry, one space for each unit. In addition, the guest parking is .25 or one space for every four units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that generally comes out to 1.25 spaces per unit. That is a slight increase from the standard that was in place just prior to that. The prior standard was a 1.5, so it got reduced by one half of the space for a unit in the downtown plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would just like to note that historically over the years, the parking requirements for the downtown have varied fairly significantly. They were back in the the sixties, they were as low as a 0.5 for the downtown area. They increased to 1.25, they went up to 1.5.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so they've slowly increased over the years until the downtown plan where we have a slight decrease. So it's been a lot of fluctuation in the parking standards downtown. But with the introduction of the blue line, that was an appropriate basis with having very high quality transit in the downtown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was another basis for the city too, to justify reducing the parking standard for the downtown plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's my understand when we look at cities like Long Beach that have reduced parking, we're. Diamonds for their downtown. It's because we have other modes of transportation, and in fact, it's because we want to have a walkable, safe city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's exactly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. And I know that that is a tough value statement for some folks that live in the parking impacted area because it's really challenging to drive around for 40 minutes looking for parking. So I just want to recognize that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Going to ask public works to go ahead. If you could answer these few questions for me, give an overview of Alamitos and where the parking is. I know we've added back the parking on Alamitos in front of the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if you could talk about that and if you could talk about where we are at with the parking study from the lawsuit from from Taps, I'd appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. So as part of the Alamitos corridor, we've recently studied that corridor for a road diet, as part of that road diet between Ocean and Seventh Street, which was approved by council last week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would add 23 parking stalls in the AM peak period. By removing the peak our parking restrictions, we would also lose five additional stalls all day. So that's the summary on Alamitos Avenue itself. Other parking in the vicinity of the corridor, we are looking at adding over 100 new parking stalls on first and second streets between Alamitos'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and Cherry. This would be accomplished by converting the angle parking to something closer to 90 degree parking, and this would be accomplished as part of a paving project to take place next year. The parking study you mentioned is one that is being led concurrently by public works and development services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With that, we're studying parking in downtown and Alamitos Beach. The consultant on board has begun their data collection and nearly completed that. They've started community outreach and look to have some initial data early next year or initial results early next year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you. And I ask for that context because I think it's important to understand that while we we are not in a place where we're asking developers to provide parking for other residents and that this is a challenge location because there's a lot there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I want to recognize the history of that lot. When the doctor purchased that lot, it previously was not open to the public to rent out those spaces, and it was one of the very first things that he did, and it's been that way for about two years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that correct? About four years. And so we have a community asset that was available to us by a developer that didn't have to do that. What we've learned through the process of this, though, is that that process of getting permits hasn't necessarily been our run in the best way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so as we are looking, I know Councilmember Gonzalez and I are out there every week talking to other locations to try to open up their lots. What we've learned is that there's probably about 20 people that actually use the lot every night.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And one of the challenges is the way that we generate those permits. And so I'm working with public works to make sure that we try as we open up lots at Mula, the church right there on third, the Thai food restaurant and St Anthony's in the first district that we're trying to partner in a way where the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'city can say we want to invest in infrastructure for your lot and we want to help manage doing a parking permit online like we do for the senior center so that every month or every quarter people can get a parking permit, which is not been existent in current lots.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so one of the things that we've learned is that we can manage our parking much better and that's even without getting the results back from the parking study. And so I know that this these do not relate directly to this project being approved.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But when I look through and see 99% of the letters are about parking, I need you guys to have that context that we're working really hard to open up those lots and that building more parking isn't an option until we actually use the space that we have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also want to highlight that we have the Vision Zero plan and that this project coming in is going to help us reach that vision a little bit quicker because we are going to be installing more crosswalks and lighting and safety measures in the area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that's something that I want to thank the developers for. They've kind of gone above and beyond the downtown plan and a number of areas outside of issues of height. Let me see before I continue to ramble on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't want to take up everybody's time. I just want to give that context. The other question I have, I do want to highlight that the developers have a have met with me and have agreed that any additional parking that is not required within the downtown plan will be accessible to the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that could be done through a permit process that could be done through an open process, and that they are looking at the lifts and trying to figure out if they can add those lifts inside the garage.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When you guys talk about affordable housing, I think it's also important to mention that John and several other developers are coming to the table. All the talk about where the appropriate affordable housing is and what the right funding is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This was a private project that was not a city project. But I think that they have a good vision about where we can go. So I'm going to leave my comments there. I want to hear from my colleague and then I will close up at the very end.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. I would also like to thank everybody who's been a part of this. I know I had two meetings myself, both with Councilmember Pearce and myself in the first District and then last night with more of my residents.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I appreciate every single one of the residents and everyone who's been involved. I know, unlike maybe other projects, our residents are very well versed. As Bebe mentioned, they come from real estate backgrounds, they come from development backgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So they absolutely have the wherewithal and the knowledge. And so I definitely respect and appreciate that. And I took a lot of notes last night, and as I told them, you know, I dusted off the downtown plan to refresh my memory.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if any councilmember understands downtown, it's definitely me. And the one that lives in downtown raised my kids there. I understand the parking impacts firsthand, and I've been here for about ten years, you know, not just working in the city for almost a decade, but living here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's really important for me that all of this was taken into consideration. So with that said, I have a couple of questions in relation to the shade analysis that was brought up. Can you give me a little bit more information about the study and what that entails, please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Councilwoman Gonzalez, the shadow study. It's included in the plans. It is the search on page 35 and it goes to page 43.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It did find that the project will cast a shadow.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On adjacent uses, particularly the residential use to the east and commercial uses to the north. And that's particularly during afternoon and evening hours. The without understanding, the developers worked on designing the project sort of around those impacts and that's how they got to push the massing to the Alamitos frontage and pushed the massing towards the north end'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the project and kind of scale it down on the south and east sides, which are adjacent to the residential uses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, great. And so it looks like around midmorning, that will be a little bit at maybe at its height, but then afterwards it could be a little bit better. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And then light sensitive uses. I understand in these sequent analysis it just refers to Long Beach Unified School District. Can you clarify that as well?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. One of the speakers mentioned or just ask the definition of sensitive uses and suggested that a residential use would be a sensitive use. That is a very specifically defined term in the California Environmental Quality Act or sequel.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A In the they're referred to as a sensitive receptor. And a sensitive receptor is a use where the occupants of that facility over a long term may have potential particular sensitivities. And typical sensitive receptors are places that have either young children or elderly or infirm individuals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it would be a hospital is a risk sensitive receptor a day care facility where you have young kids throughout the day. A senior citizen facility is also a sensitive receptor, but generally a commercial use or a standard residential use.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They are not considered sensitive receptors.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And that would be the only that's clearly defined as that. Just so I'm getting that clear.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That? That is correct. So when we analyze a project per that standard, it would have to be one of those uses. Otherwise, there's no basis to evaluate it as a sensitive receptor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great. Thank you. And in relation to the design, so I'll have to be really honest, when I looked at the design at first, you know, you look at it and you went downtown, we want to see bold, we want to see innovative.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I now looking at the presentation and talking to the developers, I do see that innovation and that boldness in that. And it's absolutely subjective. But I can understand where residents feel as though, you know, this looks like other developments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I have a couple questions relative to that. So seven stories, 77 units, were pre-sales and were they an option at all and maybe including some sort of walkway to break up the massing at all?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The I don't think that the the proposed project includes poor sales. I think we look for for per sales. We look for natural breaks in the design of the project to include per sales. But there are some openings in the project, but they're not technically per sales and those openings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let me just pull up the plant briefly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And I guess to help that, I'll just kind of piggyback off of that. Is was there another iteration of this design prior to what we're seeing now?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, we the very first initial design of this project was not acceptable to staff because it did not have the level of articulation.

        "'speaker_8': 'staff had originally expressed with the initial project architecture.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So we have changed somewhat from the original, of course, and there is this new iteration now that is in the Planning Commission's eyes. And in your eyes acceptable?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct. Okay, great. And last question is about the raised terrorist garden on roof, which I think is that a requirement?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Requirement per se, but there is a common outdoor open space requirement and the terrace fulfills part of that open space obligation in terms of square footage.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, great. And that would be considered. With the downtown planet, it's called a green roof or an eco roof deck.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, great. So it's not required. And. All right. And I asked about that. So and the angled balcony, I know we've talked about that as well, but I think that's also another option here that I believe wasn't included in the first iteration.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there was a lot of work done on the facades between iterations and one of the features that was, I guess, enhanced in this this rendition is, I believe, deeper balcony projections and deeper bay window projections.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, great. Thank you very much. Those are all my questions I will say. And I want to thank staff. I also want to thank Eric as well last night for being there to talk about the Alamitos Road Diet.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'It's for many years in advance. And a lot of us expect to be here far beyond, you know, a few years, whether you rent or own doesn't matter. And I will say, although, again, it's not relative to the the project per se.'",

And yes, they're going to be creating parking lots or parking spaces that are a little over what they need to on site. But just in the adjacent area, I counted between her work and my work alone, almost 500 parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'll go over that 80 spaces that will be working with St Anthony's on over 50 spaces in District two, which would be the lot which I think is health care partners. There's going to be another 41 spaces at the Seventh Day Adventist, 70 spaces that I created in the East Village on the western side of the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'East Village in the First District and 18 spaces, which is the net result from Alamitos Road Diet. So that leaves us with about 470 spaces and I'm sorry, there's 250 at Mola that I know Councilmember Pearce is working on as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And when I first took office, that's the very first thing I did was a parking study to look at what we can do in the downtown area specifically for parking before any of this development came out. So there's been a lot of work put into that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I want to assure you that that absolutely is being done separate to that. And a lot of people talked about affordable housing. And as I mentioned last night, the first district is actually home to the most affordable housing in all of the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have over 1700 units, 300 more that are coming on. So over 2000 units that will be created by the end of the year, actually end of next year. And so a lot of affordable housing being done and created.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So do we need more affordable housing? Absolutely we do. But we absolutely want to see them in various places in the city. So overall, in addition to that, there's about ten bus transit lines in the area and over 36,000 square feet of green space added, which has become minor park in that area alone and other areas of'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And we have a 106 parking stalls. 97 was required. We've got 23 bicycle parking spaces, 20 was required, required. We have over almost 9000 square feet of common space when only 4000 was required. As you guys mentioned, there's a community room that's almost 800 square feet and only 500 was required, 1700 square feet of private open space'",
        "'speaker_7': 'where 13 was required. I think that one of the conversations that I've had in my neighborhood, particularly with the North Alamitos Neighborhood Association, is the the lack of access to community space and community rooms to be available for meeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think one of the challenges with this location is also that it is going to be the highest story in the area. And so making accessible the rooftop community space for residents, neighborhood associations and bids is something that the developers of offset owners have also said that they're open to doing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, I'll I'll highlight that this was, you know, a process and a project that I think does fit the neighborhood. Looking at the massing of it. When I think about the current being on Ocean and Alamitos and the change up to where Mola is and all the work that's been done, I really do believe that the design'",

        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I think our constituents, whether you agree or not on language access and how far it goes to be able to say that we can relate information differently depending on how well you speak English is is not something that I'm okay with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I really want us to focus on the quality of the interpretation. And then I do feel like because we have supplemental agendas that come out on Friday, the 24 hour advance notice is appropriate. Otherwise, you're talking about a Friday at noon and you've got 4 hours to inform people that something's been added and then to to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'ask for an interpreter. And so to be clear, it's not every Tuesday. We don't always have interpreters here unless it's requested. Correct. We're still on that. That is correct. Those requests for interpretation at city council and commission meetings are handled by the city clerk, not language access policy, but those are done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's not a standard that they're here. Every single thing have to be requested. Okay. And so that was what Councilmember Durango had made the change, if I understand correctly.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, that's correct. I would like to see language services always providing continuity night.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you. And then I do you know, there's other the item on here around ensuring that this is something that's in all city departments. I think we in my in my district, we look at language access as our job, not as the city manager's job.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if I have a community meeting, I make sure that we are getting people to come out, that we're translating material in my office. And so I know the structure right now is here is this part of money for language access?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I want to echo my colleague's comments. And really, we need to be able to get to a place where we're structuring the funding so that everybody has a little bit to be able to work with and make sure that it's it's a much easier process and institutionalized that way versus piecemeal it the way that we're doing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'it now. So I guess my only friendly to this would be the 24 hour notice just because I feel like we've got enough. That's sometimes people don't find out about an agenda item until the day of you know, and making it 72 with the weekend there, it's really tough.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'd like to ask if you would accept that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, you know, that would not be my call. That would be staff's call in regards to going to 24 hours. But I certainly could support that because it makes it makes it a lot shorter turnaround, obviously, if.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's something that's accessible for staff. Right. That's something that I definitely would want to see. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I want to thank the staff for their time on this. I will say, though, there is one consistent complaint that I have received from constituents, and I've communicated this to technology and innovation, and they said that they were the ones who would be helping with this, not language access, but I'll bring it to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are still a number of people in my district who do not have dial able phones and cannot press one for English. They literally cannot press one on their phone. And therefore they come to my community office at Wardlow Park and say The phone consistently hangs up on me because I cannot press one for English.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why, if I press nothing, can I still not get through? This has been a over a year complaint from at least two constituents who cannot reach their councilperson or the water department or the gas department or any other department because they cannot press one because they have a rotary phone and they should not be left in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'past. There has to be an option for a default that if you press nothing, you should still be able to get help. Because I believe that our seniors are also the key for us to for Spanish to give us anything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there has to be a default. There has to be a person. And I think I've said this a half a dozen times, I've put it in writing. I don't know what else to say. I know you're not technology and innovation, but any help you could be provided.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have a man who would love to speak with you. His name is Dawn. He comes by our office regularly to communicate because he has no other option.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In our preparation for this. We did reach out to Rick Barrett at TED and he did provide us with an update. I can't remember the name of the vendor, but they did set English as the default language if no button was pressed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And because we just found out about this, about I think last week, I haven't had a chance to test it, but I'd be happy to do so and report back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please do. And if you cannot, I would like language access removed from my council line because there are people who are still disenfranchized. And when we answer the phone, which we answer the phone almost all the time, and if a message comes in in any language, I work with staff to make sure that it's interpreted properly so'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Counsel, for a super Don.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I'd like to thank all the speakers for tonight for staying late with us. It's greatly appreciated and special thanks to Mrs. De La Cruz Brown for meeting with me and my office along with the Cambodian community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just wanted it was off topic, but I just wanted to respond to something I said here tonight that one of the speakers said they felt that we weren't doing enough for the Cambodian community. If that perception is out there, I would just encourage those people to contact your council office, contact the UTC.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Suzanna We'd be glad to take those kind of calls, I'm sure. So I just encourage you to reach out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. I first would like to thank the everyone here tonight. I know it's been a long night, but I want to thank all of you. Chris Miller says that the laws prevented the exception of others that energy and Latinos in action.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You guys are amazing because I know that on the Long Beach Unified School District side, they work so very hard. And so what I would also ask in this is that we include maybe something where we can work with the Long Beach Unified School District.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I don't know what type of plan they have up on the top of my head, but I think it's really important that we make that synergy and connection because I do know that a lot of parents who are Cambodian speaking my speaking Spanish, speaking Tagalog need those services at the schools as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So Councilmember Wodonga, I want to thank you very much. You this is a, you know, something I know you've been very passionate about and I appreciate the work and this is great. And Katie and Kelly, I really appreciate your work on that as well, and I look forward to continuing work with you in this regard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A few things that I've noticed in other cities is, of course, collecting data, which I think is also very important, which we're doing frequency of agencies and departments that individuals use. Translation services at commission meetings, which was included in the policy I think is so important.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Everyone thinks that the council meeting is where everything happens, but there's a lot of commission meetings happening that people don't know about and I think we need to provide more accessibility there as well. And the Cambodian community and Spanish and Filipino community, I think there's certain materials that we can even see that are highly utilized.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So obviously our Cambodian community has a large population. Of them are entrepreneurs and business owners. A lot of the business material I think should be readily available in Carmi. Even our health epidemics that happen, you know, I think a lot of happy is going on right now, unfortunately.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I don't know currently if we are. Do we have those in different languages at this at this time?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Kelly You know, I'd have to check that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. But if we don't, then I would absolutely say our health epidemics are so very important, as you know, to our communities, especially communities that are deeply affected with those issues. Housing, land use documents is a big thing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know other cities stress that, both land use and emergency services documents. And then also I've seen testimony accepted in various languages as well. So whether that's in public or through a letter, I think just accepting it and having it translated to us may be something we can do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Overall, I'll say, you know, I'm a big believer in this. I hold bilingual budget meetings, so you can imagine what the translation looks like there because a lot of big words that even on the English side, I don't you know, it's a lot of words, huge vocabulary budget equals press supuesto you have to know these things.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's really difficult sometimes even for me to translate into Spanish and click my head off on and off. But I want to thank all of the city employees that come to those meetings every year or every year with us because they come out with their Spanish skills.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's wonderful to see that. And that's exactly what Long Beach needs to be. So again, thank you, Councilmember Wodonga, for your work on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Wanted to just chime in as late as just a few things I want to just acknowledge. Councilman Ranga, thanks for stepping up on this. I remember the first conversations actually were like 2012 before the policy started, and it was some of the same people that I see in the audience and I like that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'their take, they're taking a step back and letting a new leaders come forward is not a lot of people that we hadn't seen leading on this issue now. And I actually see that as a part of this city council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. You see more leaders stepping forward on this issue and leaders who have been involved kind of stepping back and letting multiple people own it. Because I remember Councilman Andrews and Councilman Neal were two of the first signers on the item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So so I like to see the diversity and folks sort of owning this issue with all our sort of diversity on our council. But what I really want to chime in and say is there's been a real culture shift in our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a great document. I remember when it was a fight just to have, you know, have a real acknowledgment that this wasn't just a sheet of paper, that when the council changes over, the sheet of paper disappears.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, it has a real place now in the Office of Equity. And and I think the initial conversations were good. They were handled well with the community and development services. But we have to acknowledge they're in a completely different place now as a home and office equity is institutionalized across departments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, our conversation isn't about whether or not we should have a language access program. The conversations now are about how do we continue to improve it, make it better. So the one thing I would say is I don't I don't know that we got a sufficient answer on the 24 hours just yet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And here's why. I think it's it's important. You know, the city council I've seen a lot of effort on behalf of most of the council members to try not to use supplementals. And we've gotten better, but it still happens.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And frankly, no, we it's unfair to ask our community to take a look at the agenda at 430 on a Friday in order to request interpretation by Tuesday. That 72 hours is it just doesn't make any sense. And it can't be a significant fiscal change to say, you know, on all items, it's a 24 hour thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By 5:00 on Monday, you put in a request and we try to meet it. Or you could just you know, it is fiscally if that's an issue, we could say we keep the 72 hours. But in the case of of of supplemental items, those items, you you get an opportunity to request it on that item if it'",
        "'speaker_5': 'came in late. I just think it's a, you know, common sense thing. If there's a supplemental item, it should be treated the same way in terms of the public as it as any other agenda item. So I want to make sure that we would that that that piece that that piece is underscored and highlighted here and that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we actually take some time to think it through. I would hate to have any sort of legal legal issues because we treat some some agenda items differently than others. But again, thanks was really good comments here and thank you to the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You can tell on our voice we're a little we're a little tired. But but I know what it takes. You guys have jobs, you have things to do. And but you're here tonight because this is an important issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. So thanks a lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Two last comments. We're going to vote. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry I was so wrapped up in my initial comment. I was reading my notes. There's also another challenge with the voice plan. When you press two for Spanish and then you're transferred, you have to go through the entire thing again and press two again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you're waiting on hold to talk to the water department, you might have to press two for Spanish four times before you actually can get to a live person. And I don't think that's acceptable either. It needs to carry through the system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No matter which language you push, you shouldn't have to press it over and over and over and over again. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Arango.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Well, we have a long night. I want to close it out. Get it out of the grass. Yes, it's those stairs. Pataki. It's an orgy is. We're going to see those who's Comentarios can see the record out.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You'll like it. But I must say, L.A., when I say programing, I just thank everybody for being here. And I appreciate all your comments and hopefully we can move forward with this. In regard to the 24 hour, I think Councilmember Pearce made a friendly amendment to quote out to 20, 24 hour notice and I accepted that a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'friendly amendment. So I want to move forward with making the motion with the amendment of from going from 72 to 24.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'We have our deputy city manager, Kevin Jackson, prepared and also our assistant to the city manager, AJ Corey, to this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Decision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Kevin. Thank you, Pat. AJ Cleary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our assistant city manager, will be conducting the presentation tonight on recreational marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Kevin. Mayors and member members of the City Council. I'm here to provide an update on the state's Commercial Adult Use Marijuana Program and more importantly, to seek direction from the City Council on the preferred approach to regulating the adult use market in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Before I dove.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Into the details of adult use, I want to provide a quick update to City Council on the Long Beach Commercial Medical Marijuana Program. Currently, there are over 100 businesses in the process of obtaining a medical marijuana business license from the city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This includes 32 retailers, which we call dispensaries, 43 grow operators, which we call cultivators, 23 manufacturers, eight distributors and two testing laboratories. The vast majority of these businesses are still working their way through the application process and are not expected to begin operating until next year.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So far, only two medical marijuana businesses, both of them dispensaries, have actually received a business license and begun operating. Now to the state level. The state of California recently approved the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act or mask for short.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Under the authority of this law, the state will begin issuing marijuana business licenses on January 1st, 2018 to both medical and adult use marijuana businesses. However, the state will only issue business licenses in cities that permit commercial marijuana activity.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Long Beach is one of those cities. Long Beach voters through ballot measures may and may approved commercial medical marijuana activity measures, MDMA, to find where and how medical marijuana businesses may operate locally. However, these measures did not address adult use or recreational marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'To date, neither the Long Beach voters nor the city council have taken a formal position on whether to allow commercial adult use marijuana businesses to operate in the city. Currently, the city maintains an implicit ban on commercial adult use marijuana activity through its permissive zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'However, the California League of Cities has cautioned member cities against relying exclusively on permissive zoning laws to maintain a ban on adult use. Businesses reliance on these laws may invite costly and uncertain litigation from marijuana advocates or businesses challenging the city's interpretation of its zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'In other words, there is a risk that beginning January 1st, 2018, some marijuana businesses may attempt to bypass the city and apply for an adult use license directly with the state. If those businesses are successful, the city will have lost its local control over the adult use industry and the state will become the sole licensing authority for'",
        "'speaker_13': 'adult use marijuana businesses in Long Beach. For this reason, staff is recommending that city council approve one of the following two options. The first option is to request the city attorney to draft an ordinance to ban the retail sale, cultivation, manufacture, distribution and laboratory testing of adult use marijuana in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'An outright ban would strengthen and clarify the implicit ban currently in place through the city's permissive zoning code. The second option is to legalize and regulate commercial adult use marijuana businesses in Long Beach because option number one is relatively straightforward and an ordinance to ban commercial adult use marijuana could be prepared fairly easily.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The remainder of this presentation will discuss staff's recommended process should city council choose option number two. If City Council chooses option number two, staff recommends the following actions. First, the city manager's office will work with affected city departments to research best practices and develop recommendations to appropriately regulate commercial adult use marijuana businesses in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's not enough to simply recycle the medical marijuana initiative that voters approved previously and repurpose it for adult use. The marijuana industry is changing rapidly and our adult use ordinance would need to change with it. Further, over the past year, department staff have developed expertize in marijuana policy and how it relates to public health, public safety, land'",
        "'speaker_13': 'use, business oversight and enforcement. Staff respectfully request the opportunity to incorporate this expertize into any adult use ordinance development process. Second, the city attorney's office will prepare a draft ordinance to allow license and regulate adult use marijuana businesses in Long Beach using the recommendations prepared by department staff.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The ordinance will take some time to prepare. It will need to accommodate changes in state law under the MAAZA, as well as hundreds of pages of draft regulations. These regulations are yet to be released by the state and are expected later this year.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Finally, in the interim, the city attorney will prepare a draft urgency ordinance to establish a temporary hold on adult use marijuana businesses in Long Beach. The temporary hold is necessary to avoid legal challenges for marijuana businesses seeking to bypass local approval and apply directly with the state for commercial adult use business licenses on January 1st, 2018.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If option number two is selected, the city must resolve a number, a number of outstanding policy issues. Some of these key issues are listed on the next two slides. One of the main reasons for this presentation tonight is for staff to solicit feedback from the city council and the public on these issues.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'However, this list is by no means comprehensive, so staff is also requesting direction from the City Council on any other adult use marijuana policy that might be incorporated into an adult use ordinance. The first key question is how many adult use dispensaries should be permitted to operate in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'For comparison, Measure MM required the city to issue 32 medical dispensary licenses. Staff recommends maintaining this level for adult use. The second key question relates to co-location of medical and adult use dispensaries on the same site. Staff recommends requiring any adult use dispensary to co-locate within the 32 medical marijuana dispensaries that have already been identified.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This will allow the city to maintain its current cap of 32 total dispensary locations citywide. Without co-location, each adult use dispensary location would be in addition to the 32 medical dispensary locations that have already been selected. The third key question relates to zoning.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Currently, medical marijuana businesses may locate in any area of the city not zoned exclusively residential. The Department of Development Services will take the lead in determining if this same standard should apply to adult use marijuana businesses. Fourth staff anticipates that a significant number of non dispensary medical marijuana businesses will seek to convert to adult use licenses.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'For instance, a medical marijuana cultivator may wish to convert to an adult use marijuana cultivator in order to supply the adult use market. To accommodate these types of conversions. The Department of Financial Management will consider an expedited adult use application process for businesses that have already received a medical marijuana license.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And finally, the city will have to decide whether to require a ministerial or discretionary review of adult use applications. Currently, medical marijuana businesses follow a ministerial process whereby businesses are able to obtain a license from the city without receiving input from the city council or residents.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Staff recommends reexamining this process for adult use businesses to determine if a more discretionary process could be utilized. That allows for public input on licensing decisions. Regardless of which option is chosen. City attorney will return to city council in December with a draft ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If option number one is selected, the city attorney will present an ordinance to explicitly ban commercial adult use marijuana in Long Beach. If option number two is selected, the city attorney will present an ordinance to place a 180 day temporary hold on commercial adult use marijuana activities in Long Beach during the temporary hold.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Staff will develop recommendations on what to include in a commercial adult use ordinance. Those recommendations will be shared with the city attorney, who will then use that information to draft an ordinance to legalize and regulate commercial adult use.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The goal is to present city council with a draft ordinance by June 2018. Upon release of the draft ordinance. Staff will present a fiscal impact report to the City Council on Commercial Adult Use. City Council will then be requested to provide further input on the Adult Use Ordinance and submit revisions wherever needed.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So to recap, the purpose of this discussion is to seek general direction from the City Council on how to proceed with commercial adult use marijuana in Long Beach. This will allow staff time and direction to begin the process of developing a program around City Council's stated position on the issue.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That concludes my presentation and I'm available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We're going to go into the council. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I have a few questions for staff and then I'm going to make a motion. And of course. Actually let me ask staff some questions and then if it's okay with the mayor, can we go to public comment and then we can come back to the council?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I just have a few clarifying questions and AJ, thank you for the presentation. AJ and I were both fortunate to have the opportunity to do a webinar on this topic back in August that the California League League of California Cities put together.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I understand why we're bringing this item forward now, and that is because not doing so would could subject the city to litigation if we were sued based on a denial of a permit. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So in regards to that timing, then, you know, I recall that during this training that you and I received, there was the option to do a temporary ban. Can you talk a little bit about that option?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The temporary ban is essentially what is being proposed if option number two is selected. So we're calling it here a temporary hold, but it could go by a temporary ban as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then the hard sunset date would be the 180 days.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct. But city council would have the ability to extend that temporary hold as long as necessary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is we just received this presentation today, and I know that staff, a lot of times they're working on their presentation up until the time of council. But I will say in looking at this presentation, there's a great deal of information on what would happen if we picked option two.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But there's very little information as to option one, why a city would go with option one, what the pros and the cons of option one would be. So with that regard in that regards, can you educate us on what other cities in the region have done in regards to this particular issue?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if they have taken a stance on this, how many of them have made a decision to ban as opposed to allow adult use marijuana?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Sure. We did a preliminary review of cities in Southern California to see which had implemented a ban which are currently in the same position as Long Beach and are only allowing medical and which cities are currently allowing adult use commercially.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'What we found based off of our review was that, you know, we looked at approximately 20 or so cities. The majority of them had a ban in place. That ban was implemented in many instances even before Proposition 64 had passed.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Those cities clearly did not want either medical or adult use in place, and so they passed it over a year ago. Some of the other cities that had implemented the ban did so within the last few months. But a lot of them a while ago there were a handful of cities that are like Long Beach that are'",
        "'speaker_13': 'currently allowing medical only. They include Santa Ana, Santa monica, which has a proposed ordinance for Medical Compton, which has a proposed ballot initiative for Medical. Costa mesa, Desert Hot Springs and Palm Springs. There were only three cities that we can identify that have adult use ordinances in place, and that included Los Angeles City, City of San Diego'",
        "'speaker_13': 'and city of Carson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. For the cities that have recently engaged in these discussions and opted to continue a ban, do you have any understanding of what some of the reasons they cited for continuing the ban might be?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't. I mean, it's, as you're well aware, a very complicated topic that impacts many different policy areas public safety, public health, the the resources of the city to enforce both the license and unlicensed businesses. So each city is probably looking at different elements of legalization and making a termination that it's not worth some of the consequences'",
        "'speaker_13': 'for the cities that choose to legalize. They may be emphasizing medical access, potential revenue sources, things that affect. So there's pros and cons to both sides. And I don't know exactly what into each city's consideration.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, and that probably wasn't that question probably wasn't phrased in the best way in light of the current situation with the state's bureau on Cannabis Control. Are there any concerns that have been raised in regards to the uncertainty of the regulations, the fact that this is a very dynamic area where there's policy changes literally being proposed every'",
        "'speaker_8': 'single day in regards to certification, testing, all manner of regulatory processes. That that is a very dynamic area right now. And a lot of cities are hesitant to enter that area right now since the laws really have not been set into place and the regulation regulatory scheme has not been established.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Have you heard that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's absolutely true. The laws are changing at the state level. On a monthly basis, it seems. The regulations, which are expected to be hundreds of pages in length, are yet to even be released. So it would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to propose an adult use ordinance prior to this date.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It will still be very difficult to propose an adult use commercial ordinance within the next few months. But staff is confident that if we are provided 180 days by next year, we believe the state will have its laws finalized, its draft regulations released and hopefully adopted as well.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so we'll have the information that we need at the state level to be able to develop a comprehensive recreational ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, and I certainly do appreciate optimism by our city staff when expressed in regards to any projects. But I will say, and I'm sure you can agree, that the roll out of just the medical portion of this has not been the smoothest even for the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've had a lot of clarification that we've had to do. It's it's a new venture for us. And so we've had to go through. And although it's been I mean, I'm one of the districts that is having a medical marijuana dispensary operating currently.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I know that the business owner is here. And that partnership has been nothing short of fantastic. And I'm very grateful for the partnership that we have with that owner, and I wish them nothing but success. And so in that regards, it's it's been it's been a great relationship for us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what I will say is that I think we can all agree that setting policies and establishing regulations can sometimes be a bit of a messy process, and two of the 32 are open. We still have 30 facilities to go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right, 30 dispensaries to go.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, you know, my my thoughts on this are, you know, I still have the same reservations about the resources that will be consumed through the operation of illegal dispensaries in the city. And what that will mean for the quality of life issues that our residents experience, since they will not have the type of police resources that they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'deserve, since those resources will have to be routed elsewhere to enforce illegal operations. Those concerns that I have still remain, and I know that many of the business owners, in fact, we met with with the business owners that are going to be establishing a property in might establishing a dispensary in my district at Fourth and Redondo last'",
        "'speaker_8': 'night. Again, lovely people really enjoyed meeting with them. They're coming to our district by way of voter initiative, and I approve that. And I'm going to partner with them every which way that I can. But that doesn't negate the concerns that I have regarding the drain on our resources.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we have yet to see what the practical application of our regulations and what the resources will be once these facilities are operating and we have a market that might be illegal in nature established in Long Beach. So I bring this I understand why staff is bringing this item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that we've only started to implement the medical marijuana voter approved initiative here in the city of Long Beach. The process itself has had some uncertainties, with many requests for clarification along the way. The state policies are changing very rapidly and dynamically, and it would be my recommendation to my colleagues that we can explicitly continue the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ban and revisit this issue. After all, 32 of our medical marijuana facilities are opening and opened and operating before we expand the services that they're providing to allow for adult use. I think that would be a better time for us to reevaluate the situation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We'll have some data from which we can assess what the implications or consequences are, if any. Perhaps there will be no consequences, and then we can roll out the cocoa use option. So that's my recommendation, is to go my my motion is to go with option one and continue the ban until all 32 of our medical marijuana'",
        "'speaker_8': 'facilities are in existence. And then we can evaluate adult use. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. You want to speak to the motion? Councilwoman, go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I could get from. Our staff. What? I don't want to be your first name. Age. Watch what timeline you think we will have before all 32 are open.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's hard for us to say. The reason is because that's mostly out of our control. A lot of it has to do with the quality of the architectural drawings that these businesses submit, how responsive they are to department requests for for changes to those plans when they begin construction.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'How long that process takes them. If they clear inspections, if they don't clear inspections. So I suspect that the bulk of the businesses will be open perhaps first quarter, second quarter of next year. But there could be a few businesses that maybe for structural reasons, their facility is not working out.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They have issues for other reasons that prevent them from opening for perhaps a year or even longer than that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I will only add that I. Commend your work on this effort, and I commend the continued work by some of my colleagues to ensure that we are being prudent in our rollout and in addition to policing the band.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like staff to work towards what a recommendation would look like when and if it comes back, because I recognize that it will take a long time to develop. I think that there need to be incentives for those that are good operators to have the first option of adult use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Should this council decide after the second quarter of next year to repeal the ban and implement some policies. I think that at a time when the staff are confident in the policies that would outline the operation, I think that would be a great time to bring it back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that sunsetting the policy at an arbitrary time where we may or may not know what the state is doing is different. But I think that those policy directions should be in progress immediately with a goal of you bringing that back to council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Close the second quarter next year. With a two from four at the minimum. And I would also add that should these policies not only need the direction of the community I'm sorry, the city staff, but the community is who voted for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the community should have some input into the adult use side. There are a lot of individuals who are strongly in favor of the option of marijuana but have some concerns about. Which direction the building will face. There are some locations that are going to be built out differently than others, some that will have drive thru, some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'will have different things that are at least being talked about in the community. That may just be rumors. But I think that looking at and incentivizing those that have strong cash handling policies, those that whatever it is that we feel as the first quarter has opened and closed, whatever businesses are the models is what we should probably'",
        "'speaker_2': 'establish the requirements after. And so with that, if you're open to that. Councilwoman. Sure. Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There was a request to first go to public comment. I have other council members I want to speak, but I'm going to go to public comment and then we'll go to the council as folks are queued up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please, there's a lot of council discussion they want, so please try to keep it precise. I think most folks are I've heard a lot of testimony on this topic, so let's keep it brief and let's let the council get into it into the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But actually, Mr. Parkin, that you have something. I just saw you queue up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. Just to clarify, the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Motion is, as I understand, it would be option one to for the office to prepare a ban and bring that back to city council to implement until and then at such time that 32 dispensaries are operational, there would be a report back from staff on the dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Mungo I'm not sure I understood what your requested friendly was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my requested friendly would be that it sounds like after the second quarter of next year most would be open. So instead of giving a a firm date of all 32 must be open. I would advise it to say that staff continually work from here forward on a two from four outlining some of the guidelines and to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have it back to us by so.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I and if I understand the revised motion then would be due for our office to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Draft a ban retail sales of recreational marijuana. And at the end of the second quarter of 2018, there would be a staff report, at a minimum a two from four memo to the mayor and Council identifying.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Issues associated with adult use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Recreational and recreational marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And opportunities. Should they think the policy is appropriate at that time? What are the best practices? So we would be in a position no matter what direction we felt at that time. We wouldn't have to wait another six months to write something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would be in that process of what would it look like if we went that direction and keeping abreast of those best policy practices.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think the clarification.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That I need is that we would not at this report would come back and at some point the council would have to decide to repeal the ban and direct us to prepare an ordinance so there would not be an ordinance prepared at the end of the six months, it would be a report back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then council can make that decision and or give that direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. And at that time, they could theoretically do both at one council meeting. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let's try to keep our comments brief. Again, we have other council members queued up quite.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brief, fully supporting the approach of Councilwoman Pryce. But I'd also take this approach everything. If we're forced to travel down this path, every single license every year would cost $10 million and that every transaction would have a $1 million transaction tax on that transaction, no matter whether it was recreational or medicinal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also if you could point out the that one of the reasons for that. Is this city in too many instances is extremely poorly managed. And that we have a mayor in Kew that is going to be arrested for corruption.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And until such time as that gets squared away and the management gets squared away. We need those dollars. To protect the voters. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is Christina Cahill. I live in the second district. These are just my personal feelings about the whole marijuana issue near my home. I guess one of the first medical marijuana dispensaries is opening. I wasn't that aware of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then then I was aware of this that you are going to decide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Whether to ban the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Recreational. So here I am. I didn't have much time to prepare. But what I don't hear from the conversation is, you know, there's a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Beat marijuana, there's a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Harm. It's both psychological and physical. And I don't know if it's talked about or even known. I've known about it for a long time. Just even preparing for this. I looked online. There's a lot of harm. Some of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Effects. I want us to be wise in this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if it was my choice, I would minimize it completely. That's because a lot of people are vulnerable to getting mixed up with it too deep and affecting their lives in a negative way. Just one little experience I had.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's just one. It doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Define the whole.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Industry, but.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Me and my friend went to get some medical marijuana. I forgot it was in Orange County and we just I expected it. A brightly lit kind of positive place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Clean, all that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Stuff. And it wasn't it was really, you know, they had they said there were medical marijuana. They had huge graffiti inside a pot, smoking animals and stuff. Plexiglass makes you seem like someone's going to shoot any moment and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It really weird. I want to get out of there. It was very dark. And I mean, let's be honest, it's not all medical marijuana, marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But some of the negative effects are I don't know if people know. Heart attack goes up 26% after you have some pot for teenagers that the brain is still developing, it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Affects their brain.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A negative way could change kind of the course of their life. There's also smoke in the lungs, you know? You know, cigaret smoking is very unpopular. Well, that comes from a plant and that's very damaging. There's no reason to think that marijuana also wouldn't be damaging.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The only reason it hasn't been studied is much because it was a class one drug for so long. They do know some.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Things, but you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Know, it's still smoke in the lungs in 10%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of the people become dependent. What does that do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To young people? I have my own experience, not with me, but some friends. When they become dependent, it becomes a major focus in their life as opposed to other things, their growth, their development as a person.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know if that is healthy. I don't know if that's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A good thing for a community. Also, my research today, I found out there is more crime around these dispensaries and in the Long Beach one. Thank you very much.'",

Among Eldorado Park Estates, resident and voter from District five, and I'm very concerned about a pot business, medical, recreational opening up in my neighborhood that has been proposed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would like the city council to know if they don't know already that Los Alamitos High School is a block away from this proposed site. And Newcomb Academy, which is a ky3, is approximately three blocks away. And I want to ask the city council a few questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are are these are these dispensaries this close to schools appropriate? Question number two, do minimum standards for locations have to pass the common sense test? And three, what do you say to residents and voters that live here in districts that are going to be impacted by businesses given licenses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To sell marijuana in their neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One more thing is I work in L.A. and I pass by these sites all the time and namesake Kush factory and all the crap that around these locations is something that is visible and something that unless you are around these things all the time.'",

My name is Susan Soaries and I'm the executive director of the 501c3 nonprofit organization CARE, where my mission is to advocacy and education of the cannabis plant. I was 33 years old and I was an Orange County Republican soccer mom leader in the Mormon Church when I sustained an injury to my head.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I can tell you that cannabis saved my life. I want you council members and mayor to think about something when it comes to recreational cannabis. At my event on the Queen Mary last year, I had California State Comptroller Betty Yee come and speak to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one of the things that she mentioned was that we need to look at tourism and what California cannabis tourism can mean to us. This is money that doesn't come out of your constituents pockets, and it's a big, big number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She said that we, if regulated properly, which is a big if, if regulated properly, we could see a 20% increase in tourism. That's really important to Long Beach. That's a big number. We're talking about statewide, possibly up to 27, 28 billion extra dollars.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's coming from the outside in. We're talking about 300,000 jobs that are not easily replaced by robots. So I think it's time for Long Beach to be a leader. Let's not look at what the other cities are doing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's Long Beach doing? Long Beach is awesome. We've got the cruise ships coming in. We've got the best port airport in America. We've got some of the best restaurants and hotels. Let's leave California. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next week.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'It is so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A part of our culture. And as far as I'm concerned, these owners have just been screwed over and over again with all the permits that they've been trying to get and being. It's just it's taken forever. And they're buying little lotteries in years, turning up and then having to close it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Come on, the kids are selling it. It's this isn't a joke. Okay. So what we have to look at is the pools that are coming through here in mass quantity. Now, I can tell you, if a kid set on dope in the park and I can at a time be like, you know, you really don't want to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'go home, come in like this. You know, there's security officers all over the side here. They can tell you your eyes are, you know, okay, I can tell the difference between the pools. They're coming through cabrio for $5 a pop.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can get them in the con. It's a X, but I don't think it's Xanax. And then the other issue is they're coming in with clear water bottles for liquor all day long. Now, if you want to look at I'm I'm is communing I feel is yeah to be honest about weed thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'of ameliorating the public health impact. I'm skeptical that taxes placed on these establishments will cover the true costs. And my second concern is that allowing recreational marijuana sends an implicit message to our.'",

But in the past few years, I've been troubled by what I see here in town. Twice I've seen middle school kids smoking weed and many times more often high school aged kids.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At times I see young women about 15 years old with groups of older guys smoking together. These are scenarios I've personally witnessed here in my neighborhood, and as I move about this city, these are obvious problems that I think will be magnified by allowing recreational pot business in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe that the existing framework for medicinal medicinal marijuana is sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To meet the needs of Long Beach residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going down to 2 minutes, guys. We're going to make these quick with that. The counselor wants to get engaged, so please, we set a long agenda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in 2013 while working. Oh, sorry. My name is Stephanie Dawson. So I'm a resident of the second district. In 2013, we're working for then Councilmember Robert Garcia. I asked Councilmember Abo Austin why the city can't seem to fix the persistent issues regarding the nascent medical marijuana industry at that time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To this day, I have yet to hear more accurate analysis regarding the burden facing local government in regulating this agricultural commodity. That evening, Al pointed out to the that thanks to federalism, local government is designed mainly to address land use and tax issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Laws concerning consumer safety, labor relations and product liability are usually designed with the state or federal authorities. As a result. SB 420 In the old medical marijuana laws function as an unfunded mandate wherein local resources were being diverted to enforce poorly conceived laws with potentially large collateral consequences to public safety.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, thanks to the efforts of Assembly member Reggie John Sawyer and his wonderful staff, which includes Councilmember Austin's wife, we have exactly what we were missing in 2013 statewide laws and regulations. We have agencies in charge of licensing discrete and highly regulated business activities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are forcing commercial cannabis providers to abide by the strictest labor and environmental standards in the country. We're requiring seed to sale tracking throughout the entire supply chain, mitigating the risk of diversion, and thereby thereby keeping the feds out of our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The voters of the city overwhelmingly voted in favor of three things last year legalizing adult use cannabis via Proposition 64, requiring the city to permit medical marijuana businesses and to tax both medical and adult use locally. Strong. Clearly, there was strong democratic will for these businesses to exist.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't see a reason, by the way, to expand beyond the number that we have for 32. And I think that this focus on the development of the retail sector is a place mark for determining when we will allow adult use as misguided.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have an existing tax at 6% all the way up to 12% of gross for manufacturing. L.A. City and L.A. County are not going to get their stuff together until next year. Perhaps. In the meantime, we can corner the entire state for manufacturing cannabis on both sides.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if you want that money in those jobs, that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Going to be the best way to make sure we have. How many of these businesses right now are applying for these licenses?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will double that by then.'",

My name is Matt Bellamy, Executive Vice President of U of CW Local 324 UFC W represents cannabis workers throughout the United States, California and actually here in Long Beach, LBC and UFC W 324 submitted a letter to the Council, the mayor, city manager and city attorney that we support proposal number two to move'",
        "'speaker_4': 'forward with having staff write an ordinance for adult use and Long Beach. Prop 64 was passed statewide last year, both locally and statewide, showing that the voters of the state and the city want adult access to cannabis. And Long Beach has gone through over nine months of hard work opening the current medical cannabis businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would just like to say that these businesses have been heavily vetted by the city and should be able to co-locate with the adult use. And the staff should take that in mind as they draft that ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's the direction I think that what's been happening here in Long Beach has been the model for what's being used throughout the country. In fact, the city of Santa Ana just last week used the same model to pass adult use in their city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the two current Carnival medical cannabis businesses that have opened are also creating good, sustainable jobs with fair wages, health care and a pension for the employees and their family. So we would ask that the city continue this work and move forward with directing staff to draft an adult, use cannabis ordinance and institute that temporary hold, which'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think should satisfy the entire council until they can move forward and draft an ordinance that would allow for adult use. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Can be more toxic. Then pulling the trigger. So the fiscal and public safety analyzes have been conducted. Millions of votes have been cast statewide. And I think it's tough to dispute that there's definitely an appetite among citizens to settle this issue once and for all and embrace policies such as the one under consideration this evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With that said, as someone who does not regularly enjoy marijuana, I have to say that I believe this is about something much bigger than simply allowing citizens the freedom to buy marijuana. This is about a band advancing the values we hold as a city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I moved to Long Beach about five years ago from Riverside, and the differences between the two cities are like night and day. Long Beach is home to an extremely vibrant, diverse and tolerant society, and all of us are very proud of it as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We should be now at a time when our country as a whole is going through a major identity crisis, we depend on and expect you all our local elected officials to step up to the plate and aggressively advocate for progressive policies that encourage even more openness, more tolerance and more liberty in our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'After all, it's this very open openness, tolerance and liberty that distinguishes Long Beach from other places like Riverside. It would be a beautiful thing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If we as a society can move past this notion of because I choose not to do something, I don't want other people to do it either. This type of thinking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Stifles growth of a free and vibrant city. With that said, I also agree with Stat's recommendation that any recreational marijuana dispensaries should co-locate with medical businesses. On that note, I strongly encourage you to direct the city manager to develop a policy that would allow for the sale of adult use marijuana.'",

The best way to address these public safety issues is to support a robust, regulated industry by choosing to wait and see like many other municipalities are doing. You are not assisting the state in bringing transparency and oversight and regulations into this industry.'",

A lot of these surrounding cities are going to go recreational. You know, we appreciate the opportunity here to operate Long Beach as medical marijuana dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we miss this opportunity to put it be put on an even playing field with surrounding cities, we'll lose market share and a wander undermine the industry. And then the last issue I think and a lot of people have said it's a fundamental issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, my opinion is it's the job of the council to represent the voters, you know, overwhelmingly in Long Beach. There seems to be a mandate for adult use marijuana. There is no question that, you know, almost two thirds of the voters support it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would urge the council to represent the citizens of their district. And I know there's a small minority in every district that's.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Substitute substitute motion for and substitute I'm sorry, it's very late tonight. And so I know historically we've gone through this so many times, but I do believe that our voters did overwhelmingly vote for recreational marijuana and over 63% of them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there are a lot of cities that are doing the same thing. And we do put ourselves kind of in a place where we can really make a statement and be ahead of the curve. And I think that this is an opportunity for us to do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there are a lot of good dispensary owners who are investing a lot of money, but they're also being community members, going to our community, talking to our residents, doing the work. That's very difficult for us to do because you all do the work every single day.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what was the voter? When was that? Was that June or November of last year?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It was November of last year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So November of 2016 was, which was not a saw case. November 2016. What was the vote percentage in the state of California?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'At the state of California? It received, I think, 57% of the vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do we have are local numbers? County, city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'County of Los Angeles was 59% of the vote and city of Long Beach was, I believe, above 63% of the vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So city of Long Beach voters were higher than L.A. County voters and higher than the state of California on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, I know that look, the city has gone back and forth on this issue for years. This is one that's really clear that the voter intent is there. You know, in Long Beach, it was higher than the other state.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I don't really want to debate that issue. But what I will say is you have we know that medicinal we had time and time again to pass an ordinance and we failed to do so. And the result was the industry went to the ballot and sort of tied the city's hands.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't want to make that mistake again very easily. If we don't take decisive action and begin to own this issue and create public policy is right for our city. Now, we don't do that. We could very well be in a position where folks go to the ballot next year, in 2018, when there's a statewide gubernatorial race'",
        "'speaker_5': '. If the numbers were not a statewide gubernatorial last time in California and it will be next time, the numbers will likely be the same, if not higher. So I think we need to we need to move move forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But one thing that we missed and what I think and I'm going to offer a substitute substitute motion, the one thing that I think is is missing is that I want to move forward with option number two. But but we do have the opportunity to add to those criteria to evaluate, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Okay. So one piece I think we need to evaluate is sort of the jobs labor, labor peace aspect and the social equity aspect. And here's why. So one city of Oakland City of Oakland has one of the one of the most robust processes that makes sure that these permits and licenses that go to, you know, the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'cultivation and the labs and all that. But there's some sort of a lens that provides local opportunities and makes sure that there are some some, you know, some diversity there. And I think we should take a look at some of those things and how we can integrate that into the recreational ordinance here, as well as the medicinal'",
        "'speaker_5': 'ordinance passed by the bill passed by the voters had had labor peace, ensuring that there were, you know, quality jobs and and, you know, a living wage being paid. And we want to make sure that that's represented here.'",

And they've made a decision. And with the passage of the recent ballot, I think it's clear that voters have supported the issue of using, you know, adult'",
        "'speaker_9': 'use of marijuana. So therefore, I support the drafting ordinance and allowed, you know, regulation of recreational recreational cannabis. And we should only offer it to those already who have license that we do not have to start a new process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's what it seems like we're doing. We can't keep going back and forth on this because you guys, the longer we wait, the more I think we're going to allow, you know, additional known as we cover these aspects of legalization.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think you can see an enforcement plan, you know, for the black market, because if we don't, someone else will. And right now, we have a chance to really set ourselves above everyone else because of what the citizens have said.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They have voted for this. And I think it's time for us to move on this, because it's been over a year since we made this magic pass and it's still only, you know, hurt from to the look. We only have two locations in the city of Long Beach, and I think that's very, very few.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we need to take some time and move on because the longer we wait, the more it's going to encourage illegal behavior in this. And I want this bill. So you guys, Long Beach, if we're going to do it, we better do it now because the longer we wait, we let other individuals come in and take over'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Of ethnic minorities for employment at all levels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in summary, some of the EU strategies that we're taking to address underutilization is leveraging technology and social media to streamline the process and create innovative ways to reach and communicate with potential candidates. We're also increasing transparency in our recruitment efforts to make sure that our applicants have access to information, whether it be through social media, our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'social media presence, or our websites. And we've collaborated with civil service to have a unified place where all applicants can get information regarding job opportunities. We're also developing training opportunities and career career advancement programs that help retain and train our workforce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we're also supporting initiatives, projects and groups that work to advance diversity in the workplace by fostering cooperation, acceptance and transparency. Some of our notable accomplishments to date include encouraging all city departments to utilize Internet based job boards, such as jobs available, indeed idealistic boards and so on, to post jobs for higher visibility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're also utilizing a Fuze executive fellow to conduct a top bottom review of our selection and recruitment processes, including civil service and on civil service to assist us in developing some strategies to streamline our process and make it more available to a diverse candidate pool.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're also increasing our presence in social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and other platforms again to increase our recruitment pool and market the city of Long Beach as an employer of choice. We've also implemented a free, free email subscription service link Albee that allows interested party parties to receive job alerts or alerts for job openings'",
        "'speaker_6': '. We've also migrated to an online based application system that creates greater visibility, allows applicants to apply easily, and allows also the city to screen applicants in a more much more expedited fashion. And we're also streamlining the application process through the use of computerized testing systems.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is being spearheaded by the civil service there, using items such as Wonderlic Montage and other systems to expedite our testing process. So these are some of the things that we're working on. And at this point, we'd like to take any questions, if you have any.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilmember Yolanda.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mary. And I want to thank Alex for her report as well as her staff. So things are just tied up now. Real quick, the equity first initiated the request to do this report. It was to get a picture of where we're at as a city in terms of our diversity and our hiring practices.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And this this report certainly points that out. I had a meeting with with Alex. We did discuss some of the concerns that I have about our diversity and our efforts in that area. One of the things that you'll notice on page, in that last page, that the database, the back and that that that page 12, you'll notice'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that a lot of the stuff that's there is what I call passive recruiting. It's put the onus on people who have access to the Internet to get an application, to get a job description, to apply and then get a notification as to whether they qualified or not.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then eventually, at the end of the road, they come in for an interview and either get selected or not. So one of the things that I brought up was the fact that this is a passive recruiting effort.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Many of you, if you don't already know that I worked for the city for 28 years to 16 of those years were in the civil service department as the recruitment officer for the city. I want to say a flat out straight up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's nothing that succeeds more in recruiting people than pressing the flesh, then being where they were. The recruiters or the applicants are you. We go to we visit classes, you go to colleges, you go to community based organizations.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You go anywhere where there's a potential for hiring people or recruiting people. There's also made emphasis that I had at the time that I was there was police and fire recruits. Nothing was more successful than being able to go and visit a police academy somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's a few here locally. Real Handle is is a big recruiting recruiting station where people go there to get training and police efforts. Santana has another one. And we would visit those places. And they also got to go up and down the state because we weren't getting enough applicants to come in and join the police department.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This era that we're in is providing special challenges because of the targeting that is happening out there with recruit and in response to public safety concerns, police and fire being under the gun and literally in regards to the job.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so there might be some apprehension, if you will, of people wanting to apply. So it's one of the things that I think is important, that when we are out there looking for people to apply for jobs, that they see people who are actually on the job and can ask them some questions in regards to how the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'job is working for them. What is the take questions related to what do they do on a daily basis, that type of thing? Well, when you have recruit pass a recruiting efforts like this that's on line and you don't talk to anybody, he's like, Well, I'd like to be a police officer, but they don't know what I'",
        "'speaker_12': 'mean. They have no clue as to what the job entails. And that's why I'm always I've always been a very strong proponent of having an actual recruiting team, if you will, that actually goes out and talks to people and and provides an opportunity for individuals to ask questions about the job itself.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Now, I know I might be talking a lot right now about police and fire, but that's also true for vacancies in the professional ranks. It's also true for positions in in our professional ranks and our technical ranks, such as are engineers and and other professional in the trades and professions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So what I would like to see is, is a greater and stronger commitment towards recruiting. And I've said it before, if you don't get them at the front end when they apply, you're not going to get them in the back end when we do hiring.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You saw that statistic up there at our page on page nine, if you could put it back to page nine where you see ethnicity and you'll see that whites, you Americans. Are the ones that are selected at the higher rate of any other ethnic group.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think that that American Indian statistic is got to be wrong. 30% Native American. I've never seen a number that I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Didn't know that number.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's got to be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's crazy. It's 30 people.'",
        "'speaker_12': '30 people. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. So 30 people are in 0%. Okay. And I get it. Yeah. Thank you for the clarification. I read it wrong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you start.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But anyway, as it's really clear here is that, you know, still white Americans are higher at a higher rate than any other group. Now, why is that? There's something going on there. So we're still being challenged in in terms of what we're doing with recruiting and getting people to apply.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so I would like to see that, you know, we reinstitute a recruiting effort, a strong recruiting effort team, whether it's in civil service or H.R. or a combination of both, I think is a is is appropriate now in this day and age where we're being challenged to really meet our diversity needs.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In addition to my discussion with with Alex. I just learned that there's a new way of identifying diversity in the RLM. For me, when I was back in the day, it was the SSA, the Service Metropolitan Service Area or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But it's not changed to to RLM where it's, you know, that is great. So I'm looking at this document and I see it as a good first start of, of trying to identify where we're at as a city in our diversity.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I would like to recommend that we get this report on a yearly basis to see how we're doing using this as a baseline at this point. I know there's there's been other reports in the past, but we haven't seen one in Barry in a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I'm going to start with this one because it's a new format. We've got a new staff. It's a it's a different way. And we've got a new way of determining our what's the the county's and the city's diversity and how we compare with with those areas.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I would like to see that come back every year. In terms of that, would I also like to see is there is no report here that includes our management team. How are we doing with our our city, our managers, our department heads, our ales and bureau managers, anything anyone who's in the EEO category, EEO being the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'management level of salaries. There's nothing here on that. So I would like to see that included as well and how we we how we rank in those in those regards. What I also would like to see is, is a some kind of plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What's our plan for recruiting? What's our plan for improving diversity? What's our recruiting plan for when we recruit for managers, for department heads? I've never seen any any of those. So I think it's important for us to know what are our efforts that just a passive like we did right here, you put it out there in the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'air and put it in jobs available, put it in Incirlik or whatever those other platforms are. That's not enough. I think we need to have people out there pressing the flesh, talking to people and recruiting them here. And that's especially true when it comes to our recruitment teams.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Now, another thing that I that I want to emphasize is, are the civil service departments very small? They have a few analysts to handle the whole city, 5000 employees, while maybe 3500, something like that of classified employees. And when we when we have this kind of we don't have a recruiting plan in how to change that, change'",
        "'speaker_12': 'our diversity. So I think it's important that city departments become part of the solution here. I would love to see. And your city manager, we could we could talk about this off line at another time. But I would like to see each department include a testing and recruiting plan in their departments budgets, because a big part of'",
        "'speaker_12': 'our departments is personnel. I mean, work when we talk about a city agency and what they do, it's all about people. It's people. It's people serving, serving people. We serve our residents by providing them with water. We provide we serve our residents by fixing their sewage.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We. We provide we serve our residents by protect, by protecting them with police and fire. And we also protect our residents by making sure that there's adequate services and whatever they need streets, streetlights, sidewalks, you name it, they're all taken care of by people, people we recruit, people we test the people we hire.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it's extremely important that we look at how we reach out to the individuals to work for the city. And we're back in the day. Used to be the dream of people to get a city job because you got benefits, you got seniority, you get the pensions, you get dental, medical, all that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, CalPERS. I'm retired now. They get around to that, which is good for me and others. But the point is, is that when you can bring that back, bring that back again, we bring it back, bring pride back into being a city employee where you can get a good salary, a good job.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And it's something that you that a person can point to, even if you wear a little emblem right here with its public works, water, gas, whatever, it's a sense of pride. And I know that many times residents, constituents might look at those individuals with a with a special or maybe with a jaundiced eye when they're taking a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'break lunch. You know, it's a fishbowl. Obviously, we are city employees are looked at differently when they're doing a job. When you see a working crew of gas department employees looking at fixing a pipe and you see five people there, why does it take five people to fix a pipe?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, each one has a role. Same thing that I always get is like, why did it take ten police units to handle a pulling over a kid on a bike and you have ten police units there? Well, each one has a role.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So and that's that's what's not understood. So I'm going to get off my soapbox at this point and just note that we need to improve our diversity. We need to change some of these numbers, especially in the professional ranks, as well as on our our public safety ranks.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And if you take a closer look, you really look at it with a with a fine tooth comb. You're looking at the fact that many of our diversity are at the lower level salaries. Your refuge collectors are parking control checkers.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They're not at the higher paying wages. And we need to change that. And the way to do that is making sure that we have a recruitment plan. And it's also that it comes from the top. It comes from the top getting our department heads to embrace diversity, to keep that in mind that there is a group of'",
        "'speaker_12': 'people out there that deserves a shot and a chance at getting a job with the city. So with that, I want to do it open. I see a couple of my colleagues when I make some comments, but this is a good start and I and I hope that we're able to continue this and maybe next time, this'",
        "'speaker_12': 'same time next year, we could get another report. And this time we might be able to include management as well and as well as some strategies on how we're going about recruiting more people of diverse of diverse backgrounds into the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, Professor. You mean Councilmember? You ran good. I'll say, Mr. City Attorney. Let's start right now. An ordinance about a noise budget for the city council will just take the model from the airport noise bucket.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I'm joking. I'm just. He's got to get a word. Bucket. That's not right. A comment bucket.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Against the lawyers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It discriminates against the lawyers. I think we'll get a pat on the back, you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Know, but I'm an English major, so really words are my thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good, because I'm a political science major. How about that? Councilmember Wodonga, thank you for bringing this forward. I know this was a great item and thanks to h.R. And Civil Service for putting this together and it it really refreshed, you know, my thinking about what we're doing here and I really appreciate the work that's been put into'",
        "'speaker_11': 'this and a few things that I picked out as I looked at this and things that I think we need to dig a little bit deeper on. My first question was, I believe the very the original item included veterans and individuals with disabilities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that correct? I thought it included that. And then I also I think at that meeting I included an option for us to explore individuals that are LGBTQ.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, the original motion did include those items and we reported in the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To form for update that we don't presently collect data on disability and LGBT data for from our city workforce or job applicants so that that information was not included in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This report.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. That's right. And are there any ways so under the EEOC, their website actually states that there are some pre-employment inquiries in and this is specific to disabilities, but perhaps there could be some for other demographics. Basically, after making a conditional job offer, an employer may ask disability related questions as long as all individuals are asked the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'same questions. So I'm wondering if that could be included going forward so we can collect that data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we can certainly look at that. One of the concerns we have, though, with the the definition of disability is so broad that it would include a large number of individuals. We'd also have to look into whether or not we could request that data and whether or not it would have to be on a volunteer basis for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'current city employees and just in my experience in H.R. over 26 years plus. I'm not I'm not aware of an agency that collects that type of data from their employees or job applicants. And I think there might be concerns that that data would be used to make employment related questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's definitely something, I think that we would need to work with the city attorney's office with and maybe look at some best practices, but we can certainly take a look into that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great. I think if we're able to get some best practices and maybe bring that back in A to from for at some point, you know, just to see if that's something we can do. And then I have seen there's two demographics that kind of struck me, and it was women, of course, and African-American employees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And for women, I see the pay gap. We have the report that contains a comparison of salary between men and women. And so it's great that we have that, you know, a dollar to $0.81 is the ratio. I'm wondering if we could dig a little deeper into, you know, what type of demographic of women.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think we may be able to see that here. But are do we have any other explicit data that includes minority women or women of not just minority women, but white women, everyone, and what they are currently being paid relative to their male counterparts?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we don't have that currently is certainly the date now that we have this data, something certainly we can look into. I would add that the pay gap data is something that a number of agencies are looking at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We did look at the state of California and the city of L.A. as well to look at what their benchmarks are. One of the things I will note is that the city's workforce is heavily male dominated, and that's true of other municipalities as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's largely because of the occupations that we have in the city workforce, such as police and fire sworn, also the blue collar and maybe engineering type positions that traditionally have been more populated by males. So again, that's certainly something that will be paying attention to and looking at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that pay gap is, as I indicated, largely attributed to to the occupations that the city has, and then also the fact that some of those occupations are traditionally heavily male dominated.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great. Well, I would say two things and then thank you for that is absolutely as you mentioned, I know we're going to do a lot of work in trying to recruit more women in these positions, especially engineering and tech and innovation, which I see is male dominated, public works, zero out of 23 women are well, there's no'",
        "'speaker_11': 'women in public works management whatsoever out of 23. I see that. And so the representation, but also just the pay equity, I think we could find out some some demographics to see where we're at with women just in general relative to their male counterparts, parts there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then lastly, with African-American employees, I see it seems like it's 0 to 1000. So either high, you know, management level or, you know, very low ranking or low pay. So I would like to see some some more diversity in that sense where, you know, we see representation all across the board in various in various departments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and so that is what I'd like to see, too. And then I think lastly, I think that was those were all my questions, but I really appreciate the work. I hope to get in for more, more information back that digs a little deeper, as I mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And hopefully we can get some more information to make us a little bit more innovative when it comes to hiring. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you. I want to say how much I appreciate the report. I know that the more we can based off user numbers to base our hiring practices, the better off will be. I think there's a lot of numbers in here and I I'm sorry I didn't look beforehand.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Did we do all of us in-house or did we hire somebody to work on this? Yes, we did it all in-house. Okay. So I appreciate all the numbers that have been included here and just a couple that I want to highlight for the public that I know are at home watching because you get the emails looking at'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the last ten years and our female representation of by job category really hasn't changed. And so in the last ten years, even though we've had these conversations at the federal level and the state level around equity and making sure that we have access for women to other positions, those numbers really kind of stayed the same.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the fact that we have office and clerical, 81% of women are in those positions where we have for skilled craft, 2.6%. And to your point, Ms.. Vasquez, I think, you know, saying that the reason why it is this way is because women traditionally don't get those jobs for council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is our job, I think, to start creating some policies, to start shifting that dynamic instead of just saying, well, women don't traditionally take these jobs. So that's our excuse for not being able to have an equitable and equal workforce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so down the road, and not necessarily today, but I would like us to start having a conversation around what other municipalities and what other organizations do to try to encourage women into nontraditional women's roles. I know the Building Trades has a big program LBC, Cal State, Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How are we really looking at the numbers and the population in our city and having a targeted plan to support education in our city to get a pipeline into our city? Because if we don't create those pipelines, we're not going to see this this change.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can get a report every year, but we've got to be able to do that as a council. So I think my colleagues, for bringing this forward, you know, and I hope that we continue to do work on this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do want to raise one other presentation that was presented to me by our Office of Equity for King County, their Office of Equity and Social Justice Strategic Plan. They have a presentation that shows what their population is in King County and then how they've been able to shift their hiring demographics to almost mirror exactly what their'",
        "'speaker_7': 'demographics are. And so as we move forward for the next report, we'll hopefully give you guys some direction between now and then to work with the Office of Equity and possibly having some hiring practices and pipeline practices to get us to a more equitable city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you guys again for all the work. There's a lot of awesome numbers in here and more to dig in on. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And before we go to the next speaker, we're going to call for public comment on this items and any public comment now will be the time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very briefly, it's a reference to this was about six months ago. When you take the beginning of this meeting we had earlier on, we spent considerable time dealing with hospitals, getting people to hospitals care. When you take your kid to the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You could give a rat's rear end what color, what sex, what country that person is. What you want is the best available person, period. And that applies to any job. Whether it be in the city, the state or a hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Anything less than that is politicking. Looking out for votes again. When you take your kid to the hospital, you could care less what color, what sex, what gender the person is. And that's the same thing that should be applied.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When hiring anybody in any company or any city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. No further public comment will bring it back behind the rail. Councilmember Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. During my presentation, I failed to recognize that we have Candice Taylor, the director of civil service in the audience. And I wanted to give her an opportunity if she had anything to, to add to the report. I know that many years ago there was a budget for recruiting and that included advertising and ability to go to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'job fairs and schools and that kind of activity. So I'd like to give her an opportunity to also chime in on the report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absolutely. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is this on?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, it is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just a couple of things I wanted to highlight. I think in general, stepping back, big picture, one of the things we need to do as a city is is just to highlight and promote the trades in general. We over the past ten years have really kind of pushed to our youth and those coming up behind us, the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'importance of education, but at the expense of trade occupations. And I think education is great, but not at the expense of choosing certain kind of occupations. And so I think there needs to be a push toward highlighting the trades and in so doing, using.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I agree and appreciate the comment that you made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'About our small team.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that we need to really partner with the the with the departments. We provide a general recruitment strategies for across the city. It would be really nice to be able to partner in doing videos, maybe focus groups to meet with certain with certain people to see if we can tweak the recruiting message to attract a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'certain demographic, to highlight partnering with the departments, to highlight a certain type of culture that might be within their department. We have tried to augment the classification specifications with an inside view, interviewing employees about the work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think if we can find creative ways to broaden that and partner with departments in highlighting stories and highlighting the employees that perform the work, that's definitely something that I'm interested in doing and in trying to engender support from other departments around that area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it would also be helpful to have training on implicit bias, our aios and those people who make the hiring decisions. That's something that could probably be a very good strategy for us to implement. And and then another thought I had is just maybe implementing and partnering with h.R.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On some employee referrals, something that might have some incentives. Oftentimes, people know people who would be great to work for the city. So I think that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would be a good strategy as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We we have typically we have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do have social media that we've used one of the areas where I think we could expand. We have a presence on on LinkedIn, but that's one of our weaker platforms. So one of the strategies I've thought of doing is expanding what we are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We use Facebook, we use Twitter, we do some stuff on Instagram. But definitely broadening that social platform and using LinkedIn more than we have in the past is another strategy that I've considered using. Alex mentioned that we're using more online, we're doing a proctor testing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think anything we can do to streamline a process to make us easier and accessible is definitely something that is going to help. But then also making sure that we're resource for those people who may not have access and just knowing that people can come into our department, we have kiosks and we have computers and we can'",
