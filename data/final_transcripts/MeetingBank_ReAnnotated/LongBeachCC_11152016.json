        "'speaker_4': 'We are developing the the Forest Wetlands Restoration Project, which is going to be beautiful, natural open space. It's right along the L.A. River, where people have the access to ride their bikes through recreation. And in the future, we hope to have uses of the L.A. River as recreational opportunities for for the public.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so when we talk about creating open space, that's exactly what we're doing in the eighth District in North Long Beach. There's going to be acres and acres of open space created. This is going to be an active, mostly active recreational space, which I think is going to be a tremendous addition to this community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, again, members, I would ask for your support.'",

About a month ago, on Sunday, October 9th, I found myself with congressman member with Congressmember Alan Lowenthal on my way to Friendship Park at the US-Mexico border.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While that tradition he spent weekends with my family, I felt compelled. Compelled to meet a man who had been separated from his.

        "'speaker_7': 'My name is Elena macias. Good. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Ladies and gentlemen. The United States is a nation of immigrants. Over the past 240 years, the nation has gone through four periods of immigration policies, the last three largely founded on fear and prejudice that tended to escalate with each period of national instability.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Only the first 85 years of immigration were relatively free and open. Citizenship, however, was limited to Anglo-Saxon Protestant men of property. Citizenship for women was limited. In 1804. It was restored with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, but was not fully realized until 1940.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The second period resulted after the rise of worsening economic conditions in some parts of the country. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Immigration Act of 1882. These laws sought to limit competition for worker wages and set the national quota system.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The policy to preserve the national origins of the United States population to that of the previous census. It would not be until 1965, at the height of the civil rights movement, that immigration would open to Latin America, Africa and Asian Asia.'",
        "'speaker_11': '30 years later, the opening was cause for a backlash in some quarters against diversity. The third period changed from economic security to national security issues due to the threat of World War Three excuse me, World War Two. Enforcement of the borders and strict numbers of immigrants were instituted as well as targeted deportation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Fear of communism exacerbated concerns. We moved from free and open to terrorism as a current and fourth driver of migration policies in 1996. After terrorist attack, the Federal Government made a radical shift to limit habeas corpus and create a new detention industry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The result is widespread arrest and deportation of immigrants. With the passage of two laws the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the net cast for terrorist was even wider for foreigners that included the unauthorized immigrant as well as the authorized and the legal permanent resident.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A simple stop for a broken tail light that used to result in a fix it ticket became grounds for detaining immigrants. A misdemeanor, if committed by an immigrant became a felony, thus grounds for immediate deportation. An individual who had served a sentence for nonviolent offenses became a target for deportation the minute he was released from jail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got to serve the time as I was going to wrap it up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I urge you to support the return of Mr. Alvarez under the California Trust Act. The police officer had no duty to detain him. It happened because the policeman was informed. Had this happened to an immigrant in a similar situation just two decades before.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The family would be intact. I urge you to support the question before you and reunite this family again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. My name is Maribel Cruz and I'm with the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition. I am here today in support of Jose Alvarez to his family. Just as you heard, his family has suffered through the tragedy of family separation, which is one of the biggest fears in the undocumented community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a representative of this organization who has fought for immigrant rights locally for the last ten years. We cannot let the injustice, of course, this case go without a fight. California has supported undocumented people through providing access to health care, driver's license and other programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we cannot let the deportations and the separations of family go unchallenged. The average family represents thousands of families here, locally and regionally. They represent millions of families across the nation as well during the election process. Immigrants were used as scapegoats and talking point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we cannot turn a blind eye to the real pain and the injustice that is that this family is experiencing. This is why organizations like LBI Mercy I go in and Dawn came together to support this family in this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have held press conferences, actions at the border and circulated petitions and even testified at the state legislature in support of the Truth Act and will continue to support Jose in his appeal to come back to this country, to his home as an undocumented person and resident of the fourth District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am disappointed that my council member is not here to listen to the testimonies and to vote on this resolution because family separation happens in the fourth district as well. Every day, immigrant communities are threatened with unjust policies and practices that target the immigrant community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I stand here as a beacon of justice and organization, will not stop fighting for his say, his family and our community. I urge all the council members to support this resolution and bring Jose back. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor. Good evening. City Council and city staff. My name is Tanya Omalu IU and I am a resident of the First District. I am a member of the Building Healthy Communities Long Beach Steering Committee and also the founder of Project Alpha, our organization advocates for the reentry of formerly incarcerated individuals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as a proud member of all of us or none. A national, grassroots, civil and human rights organizations fighting for the rights of formerly and currently incarcerated people and their families. We are fighting against the discrimination that people face every day because of arrest or conviction history, as we see with our brother, Jose Alvarez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Through our grassroots organizing, we are building a powerful political movement to win full restoration of our human and civil rights. I'm here tonight to ask you for your support of the humanitarian parole of Jose Alvarez in June. The Beach c Long Beach Steering Committee wrote a letter asking President Obama to stand by Jose and his opportunity to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be reunited with his family. And today I stand here to ask you, the city council, to please do the same. Jose, his case is unique, but his story is shared by so many others. Jose served his time for his 21 year old felony conviction and has since worked hard to support his family.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'California voters are recently increasingly asking for second chances for our community and reform of our justice system. From the passages of Proposition 47 to Proposition 57 to the success of many community based efforts, these propositions fill me with hope that we do not have to live a life sentence of incarceration for the time we spent behind bars'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Jose was caught in the middle of a very harsh immigration policy and local law enforcement's collaboration with immigration officials. His individual situation was not considered. He was simply labeled a high priority system, some even at high risk and deported, disrupting his and his family's life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Deportations like this tear Long Beach families apart. And it's not just the Latino community. It's Cambodians families. It's Filipino families. It's Samoan families and so many others. This instability leads to stress trauma impacting our community's health and well-being.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As a formerly incarcerated individual. I was given a second chance by many of you sitting here. I was allowed to share my passion for community service by getting involved and giving back to my community. You see, I cannot and do not really want to give back, but I do, because that is the only way I can heal'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I believe that a safe and just community includes embracing those who have made wrong decisions and are now courageous change agents in our community. I thank you and the City Council for second chances and for the opportunity to be rehabilitated and now reunited with my family.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Um.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, my name is one where I come from. Bixby North. So, uh, just a few things I got to say. Make it quick. Um, well, first of all, this paranoia of immigrants is really. I mean, it kind of goes against the very creation of our country since.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our country was literally built from immigrants, whether they were from England, Africa, France. Everywhere. Okay. Okay. Now we're feeling now we're just here fearing people coming from our southern borders that are mostly that are mostly natives, I mean, generally mixed natives, but they're mostly natives.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, I mean, originally this was this was their land. I don't see why we have to keep doing this. And then another thing is that, like, look, like many people said, these minor offenses should not be basis for deportation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, come on. Not not having your lights fixed properly. Like how? Getting deported for that. How is that going to fix anything, really? And then. Because of this, these things, people tend to live in fear. And, you know, it's it makes it hard for people to live in everyday life and support their families.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then here's another thing, because many because these people have to support their families and sometimes even the rest of the country working in farms, manufac, you know, manufacturing plants and other such places. Well, we're limiting their ability to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And my last point here is that we should serve as an example for every other city and basically the rest of the country as a sanctuary for immigration, for for workers. And this this will be another step towards a truly free United States of America.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am done.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And so I think it's important that everyone's here. You know, Mayor Garcetti said, we see something that is hostile to our people, to our city, bad for our economy, bad for our security. We will speak up. We will speak out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will act up and we will act out. He went on to say that the Los Angeles Police Department will continue to enforce a special order for the Gates signed directed that bars officers from contacting someone solely to determine their immigration status and went on to quote Our law enforcement officers and LAPD.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do not don't go around asking people for their papers, nor should they. That's not the role of local law enforcement, he said. And I would suggest that that's the same for the campus police. You know, we're not supposed to be afraid of our president.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're not supposed to be afraid of our police chief. We're not supposed to be afraid of going to school or picking up our kids from school. We do that every day and everyone else should have that freedom. The word of the day is fear, as that gentleman up there said.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think he's left now. But as community and civic leaders, we cannot let our community live in fear. If you don't address the fear your community is feeling, if you remain absent or you stay at home, or if we have leaders, do not stand in front or stand besides our community to keep the city from feeling unsafe'",
        "'speaker_7': '. We're not part of the solution to calling the fears of our community. LAPD Chief Beck said, We are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody's immigration status. We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is not our job, nor will I make it our job. And for that, I take my hat off to Chief Beck. This is me wondering what about the city of Long Beach? I want to first highlight and thank Mayor Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I he was on the stage was senator our new senator, Kamala Harris at the table a presentation where they came out and also said that there needs to be some assurances for our immigrant populations and others. But I would like to know what actions will you take to help residents of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Students at Long Beach Unified School District, students at Cal State, Long Beach, Long Beach City College. What actions will we take to make them feel safer? President Johnson. Jane Connelly, after those deportation initiated by her campus officers, said that temporary orders in place to protect undocumented people from being detained for immigration violations by campus police are now'",
        "'speaker_7': 'permanent. You can be certain that we will continue. Cal State, Long Beach, long standing tradition of welcoming the family and friends of our students regardless of their status. So we have an opportunity to act to make a statement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's just a resolution. It's a nonbinding, non enforceable action that is symbolic to show support and acknowledge the fear in the community. But it matters and it matters to us. It matters to the community, matters to everyone behind me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I ask that you send a message to our community that you care, that we want everyone who calls Long Beach home to feel safe and leaders in L.A. have come forward. Cal State, Long Beach, the leaders have come forward.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Again the people in this city who are immigrants. If you're here legally, you should have no problem whatsoever. And I found it rather astounding that we have people from a university that don't understand what happens when a nation does not maintain effective immigration policies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Period. If the man was not stopped because he was of one color or another, he was stopped because he had a red light period. And then they followed the controlling existing law. If the law needs to be changed, you change it.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to everyone who came out to speak tonight. I want to start by thanking my colleague, Councilman Urunga. I had an opportunity to speak with him tonight before the council meeting started. And I can't express in words how appreciative I am for the compassion and the sentiment behind this item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I did not know until tonight that he had actually traveled to the border. And I one of the things that I really value. There's many things I value about my colleagues. But one of the things I really value about him is that he is a man who works very hard and with a lot of passion.'",

I believe it was about a year ago that I had the opportunity to vote on an item that supported federal legislation in terms of immigration reform.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'The fear in light of the election for many people is real. Many people throughout the process of this election were demonized as a result of their religion, their background, because their parents may come from a country that is not one that is of much popularity with certain rhetoric.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I understand that fear very personally, and I know that it's real. I do want to say, though, that my. Concern with this item, and I shared this with Councilman Yarrawonga. I've had the opportunity to research this issue since it was first on the agenda several weeks ago and.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Because if you research humanitarian parole, it is a very, very narrow, limited exception within the federal law and one that is extremely difficult to qualify under. That's the reality. I've had the opportunity to research this issue and speak with federal officials who are familiar with humanitarian parole.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And one thing that folks on this, people who come to the meetings have realized about me is that you may not always agree with me or my analysis, but I do meet with everyone. I really research things and study hard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what I don't like to do is give people a sense of false hope because it feels really great in the council chamber when we vote on something and we get the applause. But we know as council members or we might know or we might have a sense that what we're voting on is actually something that we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'have no power over. We recently voted on an issue like that, and I don't know how we turn around and speak with that community because they left here with a sense of hope. And so my concern with this item is I wonder if my colleagues and this item is going to pass.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's going to pass regardless of how I vote. And that's that's for sure. But I wonder if my colleagues would be interested in having a resolution that goes more towards not this particular case, because there are thousands of families in the same situation as Josie.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thousands. I deal with families like that in my day job and hearing from children who have been victims of crime, who have been separated from their family and trying to survive on their own here in the country, it is very, very tragic what happens to the families.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I wonder if it would be more appropriate for us as a council. To author a resolution that urges, through the help of our congressmen, some changes in the law to allow for situations like this, because humanitarian parole really doesn't apply to this situation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you read the law, if you read the letter of the law, there's only one element in the elements of that particular law that might qualify for this situation. And it's the public interest element. And there's really nothing about this situation that the federal government, not me, but the federal government is going to consider separate and apart'",
        "'speaker_8': 'from the other families that are going through this situation to qualify as the public interest exception. So I wonder if there's an interest by my colleagues to author some sort of a resolution that that more urges a change in federal law in regards to this issue, then as to focus on a specific situation, knowing that we may'",
        "'speaker_8': 'not be as impactful as we'd like ultimately in the outcome. And again, if that's something my colleagues are interested in of this item, I would ask that we urge the city attorney to draft such a resolution. And again, I, I would like to hear from my colleagues if they're interested in that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other issue I have with this item is I really think this is a federal issue. In this particular case, the federal authorities are given the task of evaluating each application on a case by case basis and making a determination on a case by case basis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are in the situation now with Josie, and my my heart goes out so desperately to the family. But again, we might have a situation next week or a month from now or six months from now with the family going through the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And how are we going to say no to that family? We can't either author case specific resolutions, but we can as a city, unite to author something that's more general and more broad and hopefully more impactful on the general policy as opposed to a specific situation that may not fall under the parameters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I commend the authors of this item for bringing it forward. I thank Councilman Yarrawonga for giving me the time today to share with me honestly and allow me to share with him honestly and to respect our differences in regards to the issue at hand.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I thank everyone who came out genuinely from the bottom of my heart for coming out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Uranium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Go to one person and thank you for your price, for your comments and for your recognition of my efforts that we're doing here tonight. There's some things that you said that obviously I can't agree with, and there are some things that, you know, we have to agree to disagree.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to further the discussion in regards to a comprehensive immigration law policy, I don't think is within the purview of this council. I also don't think that we can affect federal change, at least not quickly enough for this case that's taking place, obviously.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I can't support a change in the current language that we have as a draft to support the humanitarian parole. In our discussion that we had earlier, I mentioned about I mentioned four things. You know, there's the law, the spirit of the law.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What's the political politically correct and what's right. And I finished my conversation with, I think that this is the right thing to do because of the devastation that has this has caused to a to a family that did not deserve this kind of treatment, a fix it ticket.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To go and morph into a. Wider discussion, broad discussion about immigration and immigration rights was just incredible. And that's why we're here, because there was an unauthorized stop. There was a. Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay effort from a sole police officer to inject himself or herself into an issue that he had no business being'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in who was first of all outside his jurisdiction to even execute that stop. Just made a lot of things wrong in in this case and that's why I stepping forward in supporting the humanitarian parole. And in the end, this resolution will not change the law.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It may not even change Mr. Alvarez's condition. What this resolution does is tell the Department of Homeland Security that he has a community behind him. That he has people who support his case, that he has a community that recognizes that there was a mistake made many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That he paid. Four through service in in in jail. That he paid his his debt to society. And has changed his life around. Which to me raises the question when is it determinable for a person to be considered rehab?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, if that's a definition, then where an individual has. Raised a family, raised a son to serve his country, who has started a business paying taxes and sending his kids through school. If that is not if that is not rehabilitation, I don't know what is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if that is not turning a life around to become a productive citizen of not only Long Beach, but of this country, I don't know what is. You talked about creating a false sense of hope about. What do we have, if not hope?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At any time. For any reason. And that's what this resolution does. It provides him with hope. It might not be. The outcome is still up with the Department of Health of Homeland Security is still their decision. All we're doing is saying, please consider all the factors in Mr. Alvarez's background.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Consider his family, consider the need that they have for him. I just learned tonight that his wife is hospitalized and going through surgeries. When else is the husband important? To his wife if not at a tire need of of Merkel need at that point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This case goes beyond immigration. This case now becomes truly, truly becomes a humanitarian case. And that's why I urge my fellow colleagues here tonight to please pass this resolution for humanitarian parole, because it is the humanitarian thing for us to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. It's hard to follow. You can't remember hearing because I think you said it so well. But I want to be clear, we can do two things today. I want to recognize that the community and the family that's been working so hard to bring Jose back has done their research.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have found the best path that they feel that they can utilize to try to bring Jose back. And so I don't want to undermine any of the work, the tireless nights that you guys have have tried to figure out a way to get Jose home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I, of course, will be supporting this item, you know, to say it again, yes, we should do this tonight because it's the right thing to do on a multitude of levels. But too, I want to thank Councilmember Price for bringing up the idea and the concept that, yes, this is one person and one issue, but'",
        "'speaker_6': 'how are we as a city thinking outside of that? And so to have so many people living in fear every single day means that we have to act today, but that we can also act in a thoughtful manner in the long term.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I would like to suggest that we do direct staff to figure out what is an overarching policy that we or an ordinance or some direction for our city to say that we have your back, that no resident, as Tonio said, should live in fear of their president, of their police, of their school.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what are we in Long Beach doing to make sure that we can go forward on that path? So when I went to urge a yes vote and to I would like to ask our city attorney if there a process that we can move forward on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilwoman Prysmian members. PIERSON Members of the City Council. Obviously, the item that pertains to Mr. Alvarez is on the agenda tonight. The other item that you're discussing really wasn't agenda is outside the scope of Mr. Alvarez's issue. So my suggestion would be if the council wants to entertain, that is another item that that we brought back with'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a suggestion that it be sent to possibly the federal legislation committee for consideration. That would be the best path to move that forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you so much. So the the item that we would vote on today would be the same that's in front of everybody. And then we would ask for a second item to be directed to Fed Ledge. For some research on that that we could come back to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And also add that that federal led agenda will be in front of the council shortly. So it's currently going through the review process at Federal Committee and it will be coming shortly to you for you to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Add or delete anything to the agenda you'd like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to just get a clarification from Councilmember Pearce, because I know that as part of our federal agenda, we have a pretty robust kind of immigration reform agenda. And so that's there in place. So I'm I'm assuming, Councilman Pearce, that what you're discussing is essentially the the that this this would happen this resolution or this addition'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to the federal legislation that would have to do with this specific type of situation. Yes, right. That yes. Reference by Councilmember Pearce. I just want to clarify. We're not talking about price. Pearce. Price, yes. Sorry. So, yes, I just want to make sure to clarify that, because we do have a large immigration reform policy on the agenda'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that's going to come before the council in a couple of weeks, I think. And so this is in reference to the families, this specific issue, but broader than that. Okay. Good. Okay, so that's the. So, Councilmember Ranga, do you accept that as I'm assuming a friendly motion from Councilmember Pearce?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, I don't think it's a motion. I think it's something that we can bring back at a later date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. You're going to bring it back. Okay. So we bring back another date. That's fine as well. Councilman super now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I would also like to thank everyone for speaking tonight and speaking with passion. I, too, met with the councilmember this afternoon and thank you, Councilmember Turanga, for your passion and taking all your time and energy on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think anyone can deny the the each councilmember support for the immigrant communities. I think we've demonstrated that immensely. But I do want to echo Councilmember Price's concern that we don't want to do something that's misleading or are providing false hope.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I sit here tonight and you have to understand what a councilmember, to paraphrase Don Tanabe, I think he said something like, All I do every day is get up and help people. And that's what we try to do on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm thinking here tonight, how can I help this? Okay. As Councilmember Price said, this is going to pass tonight. But if I could add any value here, that's what I'd like to do. And it's very unique that an item like this, I don't receive any correspondence from anyone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that was the case on this item. I didn't receive an email, a text, any letters, nothing in support of Jose. And what I would recommend moving forward is that that is put together that we have lots of testimonials here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what's so unique for the fourth District is that this incident took place in my district. And we work very closely with Cal State, Long Beach and also the police force. The there are no northern border of Cal State, Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a fourth council district. And I heard nothing from them. And I just find that kind of fascinating that this with all the interest here tonight, that the agencies involved have not reached out to me. And I think that the point was made about the police force.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cal State Long Beach is a state agency, so you have a state agency somehow getting mixed up with a federal policy. And lo and behold, the irony is here we are at a local level trying to sort this out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where are they? I would like to see them weigh in on this. I think we have a resolution. But maybe they'd like to speak up about this particular case. And I think that's the best way I can serve you tonight, is to suggest that you go after these entities and get them to come out and say, Hey'",
        "'speaker_2': ', we made a mistake. Here's how we'd like to support your cause. So that's really what I have to say tonight. That's my advice. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. There's a motion and a second on the floor. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I do want to I just want to say one thing not related to this, but it was brought up earlier. So I think it's important to say I'm just going to reiterate something I said a few days ago when I was at Turtle Island.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you know, Charla, they're probably one of the best known groups that deals with immigrant rights really anywhere in the country. And Long Beach has and will continue to be, regardless of what happens at the federal level, supportive of immigrants, those that are undocumented, those are in the process of getting citizenship.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those that are still in students, whether they're part of fuel or they're part of there are maybe 540 students, all that entire community. And I, as an immigrant myself who wasn't born in this country, I always say the best day of my life was the day I was given the opportunity to become an American.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all of particularly the students that are undocumented and the community that's out there, they just want a chance to be able to contribute and be the best they can be for for this country and for their family.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to say that Long Beach will always and this is not a partizan issue. Long Beach will always support its immigrant population, the undocumented community and everyone that calls this place home. We're always going to be supportive of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just want to thank you all for coming out and for your advocacy tonight. Okay. Thank you. We're going to take up item nine, please.'"
