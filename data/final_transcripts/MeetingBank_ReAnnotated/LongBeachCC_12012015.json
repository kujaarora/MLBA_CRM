        "'speaker_11': 'at the time. We've been hoping for this day for over 19 years. When we thought our home in July of 1995, we were aware of issues associated with living in the proximity of the City College, but they were tolerable.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Student parking was minimal and usually lessened after the first two weeks of the semester. In 1997, 1998, the north side of Carson and Lakewood Village were given preferential parking status due to student parking issues. This migrated students to our side of the neighborhood and every year it's been an increasing problem with the proposition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'E There was the passage for the parking structure which was supposed to alleviate parking issues. However, it really didn't address the to the extent that we needed it. The bond measure e continued with the $440 million expansion that Carol alluded to with New Castle classroom construction.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And again, it migrated a lot of the classes to our site, to the southern side of the Carson Avenue. Then our neighborhood is not affluent or rich and upper class. We're not seeking anything more than to enjoy our homes and the ability to park in front of them when we get home at night.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Just this past summer, at least a dozen new families there purchased new homes and moved into our neighborhood. And the majority of these are new young families with small children who frequently are walking and taking their strollers down the sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The biggest I would say one of the biggest advantages that we've had to the to the permit parking is the effect it has had on traffic or lessening the traffic going through the neighborhoods. Our streets are safer not only for the residents, for the students as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Students that are going back to their cars that late at night are running a risk of being burglarized or worse. And just as Carol alluded to, the trash and. Items that are left out in the streets that I don't even want to mention have have basically disappeared.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Passing the item will not only help relieve the traffic to parking and safety concerns for both residents and students, but it will help Long Beach City College restore relations between its neighbors, faculty and students. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'The neighborhood had dealt with parking issues before from college students prior to the construction and as a concern for deeper impact during the build. The city was kind enough to offer us a temporary solution. The benefit of the temporary program was a great test bed for our neighborhood with virtually no cost to us and or the city'",
        "'speaker_11': 'as to gauge its effectiveness. The results have proven to be very positive. Less traffic on the streets, less garbage left behind by the students. Less heinous activity in the neighborhood related to drugs, home and car break ins, fornication and flat out bad behavior in our adjacent park area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'After reporting all of those within the current footprint, it was evident that this was the right path to continue on. During our early discussions prior to the temporary program, the offering was clear. If the results proved to be positive, we had the option of pursuing the permanency of this program, which is why we are here today.'",

Stacey Mungo for everything she's done and listening to us and taking our our message out and with with regards to our endeavor, I would like to offer the same gratitude to the city council if they approve this recommendation for'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to thank you for that. Feel free to be seated. Specifically when we talk about the safety involved in walking back to our cars. I know many people know that when I walked back to my car back in college, in graduate school in L.A., someone was breaking into the car next to mine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and there are a lot of safety precautions on the campus that students benefit from when they park in those parking structures. And I think that the adoption of ADI permit also encourages that safety for the students who may not know the area as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that our communities are safe places, but when people who prey on our our neighbors know that a student is going to be away from their car for several hours, they know general start and end times of classes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is why we have police officers assigned to Long Beach City College and to their parking structures. Additionally, while garbage is a nuisance, more importantly, it clogs our storm drains and the residents in the community have done an exceptional job both before and during this temporary parking permit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Time to maintain our community. With El Nino coming, it's even more important than ever that we take on our daily walks each day a moment to pick up trash that we might see. I want to thank all the members who have stuck with this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that it has been a very long process. I ask the members of the community of the Council to support this item and the residents efforts for so long. And I'd also like to communicate the support from the Board of Trustees of Long Beach City College.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Individually, those that I've spoken to are all very supportive. And then also the foundation and Jenny Baxter as the executive director, has been a great partner in this effort and really getting us over the final hurdle. And I hope that I will have the full support of the council this evening.'",

Although my addresses for my investment properties are not included in that, I am very concerned about the over spillage that will come down cherry and affect my property as well.'",

Whenever my tenants have complained about the people parking there, they've always been very responsive in moving their cars.

I don't believe you have very many students except those who live near Cherry Avenue, who are walking from Cherry to Clark'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to get to school. That seems like a very large area to ask people to have permits to park. And to use the school as as the reason why it seems like you're separating your community where in the long run it's going to backfire in some way.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'It's the Volkswagen Place across the street and they do have lots in the back where their employees can park. So there is the businesses over there. They have they don't have to park on cherry. They have parking area in their lots.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there and and like my neighbor said, they are walking across Cherry Avenue in the middle of traffic. And if you've ever been down Cherry, it's very congested and they just walk into traffic and something is going to happen if they don't.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely honorable. You rung up the item before you. It's similar to item number one. I think there's a confusion that we're talking about a huge geographical area. The question the area that's in question is Cherry Avenue for two blocks between Bixby and Roosevelt and Roosevelt to Marshall.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is in front of the car dealership. The residents were requesting that a permit parking be established in order to prevent the employees of this dealership parking in front of their homes. We have gone one step beyond and as one of the gentlemen explained about the squeezing the balloon.'",

And this this will allow for future residents in if they feel that there is parking problems in front of their homes, they can request the petition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We need to receive minimum. Well, there are two tests that we do in order to establish a permit parking zone. One is that 75% of spaces has to be occupied. When we do the survey. So that means at the peak hours, whatever the peak permit, peak parking is, there has to be 75% of all available parking on'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that street occupied. And second test is 50% of those vehicles have to be outside of that neighborhood. We will check the license plates for each car. And if 50% or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'More.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are parkers outside of that neighborhood, then this qualifies for a permit parking district. So we also have to recognize that these are single family homes. They all should have parking spaces in their garages and their driveways. So it gets very difficult to justify in most districts a permit parking zone.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So this this district qualified, which is on cherry, we also we asked the neighbors to participate if they want to expand this, but they're not going to have any signage. They don't have to pay for it. It will be only for residents that are facing on cherry that will pay if they want to have a parking space'",

        "'speaker_9': 'We have to establish that first. That 50% or more of parkers are not residents and 75% of spaces are occupied during our peak parking area. I don't know if I explained or clarified the issue that you asked.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think that basically that in summary, the affected parking spots that we're talking about are on Cherry Avenue. There's no spillage into the neighbors neighboring streets. I'm Gardenia or Rose. It's basically the most affected area is on Cherry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, we did hold a number of community meetings, including the residents along that Cherry Avenue, including the business owners at the car dealerships across the street. We did talk about the parking situation in regards to their employees being having access to parking in their own facility.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So a staff report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have no problem waiting to hear direction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That being me. That's okay. Well, hopefully they'll be a staff report that comes back very soon about this. So my intention with this, as many who live all over the city, this is a citywide plan, of course. Oftentimes you've heard of alleyways that have not been very safe in a multitude of different ways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So whether it's not having any pavement at all, having dirt alleys, having very bad shaped alleys, pavement is really bad. Lots of potholes or having areas where there is no lighting. And so in the First District, we actually were able to find a couple areas in the Wilmore City area that did not have any.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They had Edison Poles, but no lights in them. So we were able to get lights there. And this is a plan that we've talked about. I know it's about six and a half years ago working in the Wilmore area, we walked the area is we were able to find ten quarts in ways that were in bad shape'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And I remember we we were able to repave two of them, which is great. I know this is very costly. I know that the study when it comes back may be very costly. I also know that, you know, working with Edison, of course, getting a study back to find out which alleyways have in need, lights would be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'costly, but I still want the information. So we have some sort of plan to go off of. Should we have funding or should we have an opportunity for grants or what the opportunity may be? And so I really want to thank my council colleagues, Mongo and Austin, for jumping on board on this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's really important as we look at infrastructure holistically. I think our courts in ways that have often been forgotten and I know that we used to have funding for this back in 2006, I believe, of course, because of lack of funding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, we don't have that opportunity to look at our courts and ways or alleys as as we did before. We always pave sidewalks, streets. They're more highly utilized. But there are some areas that front some alleyways, that front homes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so these are people's homes. This is they walk out into the alleyways, into the courts in ways and this is their what they see every single day. So I look forward to getting information back what we had proposed and what I had talked about with our public works director.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're very sad you're leaving. We're going to keep saying that. When I spoke with him, we had talked about a potential plan that could mean that it would be phased. So the first phase, looking at dirt alleys, so alleyways that do not have anything at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Secondly, alleys that have very poor pavement, low PCI. And then thirdly, I proposed also looking at, as I mentioned, alleyways that need lighting. And so that's what I have here. I'll look forward to hearing back as to what we are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can do what is possible for timeframe as well. I know this is a huge undertaking. It may take a year or so, but at least we have a plan in place. So again, thank you for your openness for for looking at this and of course, my council colleagues for jumping on board again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Mr. City Manager, was there any comment from staff?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We could certainly come back very quickly with a two from for a report to the city council to respond to that. How much things would what we can do immediately? I'll talk to the public works director on what he's been chatting with District one, what we can do immediately, but certainly things like a pavement management index, an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'analysis of poles that can accept lighting, those could be expensive and take some time. But we can also take a look at what we can do immediately and perhaps, you know, where our dirt alleys are and all that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So but we can definitely get a report back quickly and tell us how much this could cost and how long it could take. And also, I do want to point out that I believe next week it's December 15th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe we're coming back with an infrastructure report. And during that infrastructure report to the city council, we'll make sure we highlight alleys, causeways and lighting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And we have several council members that are queued up. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I am very pleased that we are going to look at this. I think it's really important that when we talk about our assets and liabilities that we take into consideration all components. Throughout history, there have been variances in whose responsibility certain things throughout the city are, be it our sidewalks and other types of community assets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that knowing and understanding what options we have available will only be possible once we know those costs and have a full report. And I think that a study that brings that information to the council will then allow us to have the opportunity to potentially prioritize that over the next several years and or decades, depending'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on what that number comes back out. So I'm really looking forward to this and I think it's a great a great opportunity. There's definitely a variance. I know that when I lived in the seventh District, I lived on an alley that was a concrete alley, and all of the neighbors had back lighting and it worked out really'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great. But in the fifth District, some of the alleys that we have adjacent to Long Beach City College are. At one time asphalt, but on the near end of dirt at this point and have no lighting. And so and while we are doing everything we can in the meantime through coalitions of neighborhood associations that are working hard'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to help neighbors unite for motion detecting lights and the such, I think that a comprehensive review of what we have in what areas of the city and then for us as a community to be able to prioritize I think is great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much and I hope that the Council will support this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Thank you. And I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez and Mongo for bringing this forth. I was happy to sign on to this agenda item, as are many of my colleagues experience. I mean, we we hear from residents who are eager to get their alleys fixed.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And it's we're we're in a very difficult position when we tell our residents or we have to respond that, you know, our allies are a lower priority than streets and sidewalks. It's a it's a matter of resources and a lack of resources to address our infrastructure needs in this city.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And I'm hopeful that we can get to that larger conversation at a later time. I know the legislators in Sacramento are looking at funding options to bring monies for streets and sidewalks or streets and for local streets. I think it's a it's important for us to have this information to at least know that when we do have'",
        "'speaker_15': 'the opportunity, we can we can move forward. We have a plan. And I think it's reassuring to many of our residents that that we're not forgetting about these important issues that are important to them. Allies in the safety of our allies are extremely important.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And I'm glad that you brought this forward. We look forward to hearing back from the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I, too, would like to thank my colleagues for bringing this item forward. I think it's a very good conversation for us to have. I do expect that the study will be expensive and the alternatives will be expensive, but I think that it's important to have that data as we move forward and we plan, and I'm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'fairly certain that the study is going to reveal that we have a lot of work to do in the area of ALS. But again, having that data I think will help us be able to plan for the future and think a little bit more strategically about how we're allocating our resources.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm all in favor of it. And the third district, we have a lot of neighborhoods that have primary access to the homes through alleys. And we've done, although not very frequently just today, we have participated in the past and are currently doing some cost sharing measures with our residents to try to fix some of the most'",
        "'speaker_4': 'vital alley issues that have flooding and other issues that are associated with the alley. So I think this is an important area for us to study. And I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. And I look forward to receiving the cost of a detailed study, but also some general data that can be provided to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'us through the infrastructure report that would give us some guidance in regards to what the potential costs associated with fixing some of our most critical alleys might be so that we can plan ahead. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm supportive of this item.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Councilman Andrews Yes, thank you very much, Vice Mayor. I also want to thank Councilwoman Gonzalez for bringing this item forward to improve, you know, all areas. But this is a tremendous need in my district, especially, you know, along with paving.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And and there are a few alleys that are so crime ridden that these alleys that have no purpose. So I would like to add an amendment to the plan to include some of the closure, some of these alleys, especially with those are ones with high crime situations.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So ask of that, if you like. You know, Mrs. Gonzalez. If it's possible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think this was more so just an inventory of the allies first. But I think that once we get that information back, I mean, I wouldn't I know closure of the alleys takes a little bit more. I think it has private property involvement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's a little bit more detail. But what I would suggest is that when it comes back, perhaps we could look at those specific alleys that you might be talking about and and see how we can fit it in the plan as to what we can do to close them if that is an option.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I appreciate that very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, base mayor. When it comes to alleys, I have one name that I need to throw out there. Kathy. Kathy lives in West Long Beach. Kathy has been is an 80 year old woman who has been struggling with her, Ali, for the last 40 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a dirt alley. She gets a lot of infringement from people who just park out there and do their nefarious things. They have she has people who now are coming to create the homeless encampment in back in the back of her alley.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know I spoke it with her, with Mr. Malloy and before about Kathy. He knows well about the situation, and the response has always been the same. We don't fund for Alice. So I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez and Mongo for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a study that is long, long, long, long overdue. And I'm looking forward to the results of it, because as a consumer, Andrews has already stated these are magnets for crime. They're poorly lit. They're poorly policed, if at all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do need to look at ways that we can clean up that that part of our infrastructure to make it safer for our communities and for our neighbors. And I know that in the third district, it is true a lot of those alleys are used as entryways into house homes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think this would be a study that would be very welcome and I strongly support it as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. And I want to thank my colleagues as well for bringing this forward. Alleys have always been sort of a sore point in each of our districts. And the answer to the common question of when my alley is going to be paved, the answer of we don't have an alley paving program isn't going to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'last much longer. I think I think it's smart to look at studying the issue first and understanding what that takes to evaluate it the right way. I think that's the right way to go and we'll figure out the resources later.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've taken things on before when we didn't have the resources, but we were able to really figure out a strategy to make it happen. Additionally, you know, we figured out how to get an alley paved here there. But you'd be surprised how many residents are willing to step up and figure out local strategies to get their their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'alleys paved. So I want to make sure that, you know, we after we do this study, we make we go ahead and complete that thought by having a conversation about innovative ways to fund infrastructure programs that we don't have resources for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you again to my colleagues for bringing this forward, and I'll be in support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I have some comments as well. And I know we may have members of the public that might want to address council on this item. And I'd like to thank staff and I'd like to thank Councilwoman Gonzales especially for raising the issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is certainly something that affects all of us in our districts. I have to admit to you, I did not know we had dirt alleys in the United States until I ran for office in the second District. I have 14.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had 14 of them. And the reason for my shock is, as many of you know, I was born in India, where you are accustomed to seeing dirt alleys and chickens coming down the alleys. But that's the beauty of our democracy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do hit the streets and walk our neighborhoods and we're able to see that. And so I think each of us is pretty intimately familiar with all of the alleys and corners and streets in our district. And so out of 14 over the years, with our one time funding, we've been able to, in the second district pave'",
        "'speaker_0': 'nine of them. And it doesn't seem like a lot. Why does it take that much time to do nine? And that's because it costs anywhere. And staff can correct me between 400 and $600,000. Well, actually, 400, $600,000. The cost to survey, I think the conditions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But paving alleys is very expensive. And so I have five remaining and I put that out there. Mr. Milloy, and I know you are aware of that, as well as all of the ones in each of our districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as it's been said here before, I think Councilmember Gonzalez and other councilmembers have mentioned the properties that are adjacent to dirt alleys or severely damaged alleys. It's an ongoing frustration to worry about for various reasons. You worry about your garage, flooding for improper drainage, the damage to your fence due to cars, the large potholes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for some of our residents, their front door is right there. And so you are tracking in a lot of dirt. I don't know if those are the conditions that are in all of our districts where we may have dirt alleys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But when it's your front door, it's it's it's incredibly difficult to avoid tracking in what is in the alley into your home. So we've been fortunate enough to use one time funds to pave nine of the 14 dirt alleys a few years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're looking at what we can pave this coming year, but there are five remaining. And I do think we need to be a city that is able to identify sources of funding for street repair, infrastructure repair. And as I have said, probably for the last several state of the second district, during the last several state of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'district comments, it's a conversation that we really have to have with the larger community, the larger city, the residents. Here is how do we plan for infrastructure repair and restoration? Not so much new things, but repair and restoration of what we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's that's a partnership and a conversation we need to have with the entire city residents, all our residents. And so I think that's something that we'll have to have an honest conversation about. I appreciate that. Our city manager indicates he will come back to us with what the cost of the survey may be and also what'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the sources of funding are. And and Mr. West, in doing so, I think we also need to give this Council an idea of what the entire city's cost is going to be. We're all representing individual districts, but truthfully, we're all concerned about how will we pay for the five in the second and however many may be in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'all of the others. It's our collective responsibility. We don't just limit ourselves to navigate our own districts. So I deeply care about how all of this would be taken care of across our city, not just in the second and not just in a few particular districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm hopeful that this is the start of a larger, longer and very earnest conversation about what it will take to ensure that our infrastructure is able to sustain the activity that we have today, the residents that we have today, and perhaps the residents that we may grow to become as a city down the road.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And with that, I'd like to turn this over to the public. Any members of the public that would like to come forward and address council.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Larry Kirk has the address. I want to make sure that we address the Peel Way and the southern half of payola away, i.e. that from the pay gate, the toll gate down to the end. It is that road is has long been on the list.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It cannot be repaired. It must be according to the city and correctly so, rebuilt. Period. It is beyond repair. And I've always felt that a legal and moral justification could be used to using tidelands funds for that, since that road is heavily used by those that come to use the Marine Stadium by accident or by design.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And right now it's cracked. I myself. That. Still myself, probably about five or six times on a bike. Tires getting caught in the in the cement cracks. But the residents. Houses get flooded when it rains so bad is the alley because they've got great big trees that are taking up or lifting up the concrete and the asphalt'",
        "'speaker_12': '. And the city looked at it and it would be a sheer waste of money. The asphalt, it literally has to be rebuilt. Period. And that should be, I would hope, on the top of the list by virtue of the fact that he's used 365 days a year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'By members of the public, bringing in their vehicles, the heavy trucks. They're the the towing vehicles. Sometimes by accident, sometimes times by design. So for us, I think it's it makes sense to do that. So make sure that's on that list.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'As Angela has already said, this was funded by a Caltrans environmental justice grant and supported by the the city and put forward by the city and supported by the port of Long Beach. So we start by asking ourselves, what is this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What is this project rooted in? And it's really rooted in City of Long Beach Mobility Element Policy The Mobility Olmec calls for deep free weighing the city owned segment of the Terminal Island Freeway. Again, we're not talking about the whole freeway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're talking about the city owned segment of it ending the truck route that exists today at PCH. So that would be the furthest point that it would go on to the north and that would have the result of shifting truck traffic that exists today on that segment to other routes, including potentially Alameda Street, which is also an'",
        "'speaker_8': 'available corridor. So again, this is a first step in a long process. We'll talk about how other cities are taking a look at their infrastructure and reevaluating it really as a benefit to provide different benefits to the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, why are we looking at this segment of the city? We know that the tie we'll look at it on the map in a second and it's, you know, the western edge of the city. And this is an apart the study area that we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'City is really part of the city that has suffered really from a number of difficult existing conditions. So it really outstrips the rest of the city in L.A. County, by far in particulate matter and fine particles per square mile, it has a higher level of asthma rates than either the rest of the city or the county as'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a whole. And so and these are just like two statistics that I picked. We could look at, you know, other disparities in this part of the city. I think we were all quite familiar with the challenges that West Long Beach faces.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, why do cities look look at this or why is this city looking at this? In addition to it being rooted in its adopted policy, you know, cities across the U.S. and really around the globe are taking a look at what is really being known as freeway freeway removal and looking at ways in which to consider'",
        "'speaker_8': 'their existing infrastructure, reconsider it as a community benefit. And just one example. Pretty well known around the country, the example of Portland's Harbor Drive. You know, this is a facility that is far more intense in terms of a traffic artery than what we're talking about in terms of the segment of the TII.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is what it looked like before. This is what it has become. And the city really had a different vision for what this how this could function as a community benefit and what has become a destination, really, and a well known facet of the community and a destination within it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, again, what are we specifically talking about here in this project, in this very first step and very conceptual look at this, where we're talking about a segment of of the right of way, again, north of PCH and really north of the Cloverleaf that existed at at PCH.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are controlled by Caltrans. So we're looking at the right of way north of that to Willow. We'll look at other maps that show that we're talking about an area of about 25 acres. So on this map, you can see Willow Street to the north, PCH to the south.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But again, we're really talking about the area north of the Cole Relief's, north of PCH. And what we really notice when we look at an aerial is this contrast right in the land use pattern west of the Thai freeway versus east of the Thai freeway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're looking at really a very industrial industrialized area there, just beyond the edge of the city with the refineries, other industrial facilities and the rail yards directly adjacent to the western edge of the city. And the uses then that we see in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Contrast to the east of that are really very residential in nature. So we've got century villages of Korea housing a really facility there with with a community living there, career high school to the north of that read, Hudson Park and Hudson Elementary and then other Long Beach Unified Land and just some snaps of the of the site'",
        "'speaker_8': 'adjacencies which I'm sure we're all familiar with the community gardens at Hudson looking to the West, the buffer that has been developed recently adjacent to villages of Cabrillo, really that was early days in that buffer. And it's it's some of its outdoor equipment areas, fitness zones of you looking down Hill Street to the west and where it'",
        "'speaker_8': 'terminates currently and does not really connect to the Tai and Hudson Park itself. So, you know, again, even at this very early stage where we have not done a traffic study, we have not done technical analysis yet, that would be something that would be done in the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have taken a just a look, a very high level look at existing conditions. And again, I was talking about other arteries that have really changed in other parts of the world, in the country and really much higher volume facilities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're talking about a a segment of the freeway, really, and this is just depicting existing volumes that it carries about 11,000 vehicles a day and about half those are trucks. So about 6000 ish trucks per day, higher volume north and south.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we can see that PCH, it's a little difficult to see sorry on this, but PCH being a much higher volume east West Street even then, Willow Sepulveda to the north. But obviously, traffic is something that would have to be considered and studied in much greater detail at this project were to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Also, certainly as as we know, we're talking about a segment of the Terminal Island Freeway. You can see it in blue there with the logo tie next to it. And we're certainly aware of the network of truck routes that exist in the area that serve the port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles as well'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And so what we're depicting here are the state overweight routes, the Long Beach designated overweight truck routes and other jurisdictions overweight routes as well, and freeways. And so you can see that that this segment of the Thai is currently a locally designated overweight route.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's another consideration and another area that would certainly have to be studied if the project were to move forward. So in terms of project process, as we mentioned, there were four major convenings as part of this project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is about developing a community vision, high level community vision for the facility. So we so starting last year, we were able to convene the community in a large way and we'll talk about that briefly. But we first really asked the community, what are your top priorities for greening the TY?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And number one, really was providing environmental benefits to the communities that the space needed to work to provide positive benefits and not then cause unintended spillover traffic into the neighborhood and introduce new linkages for pedestrians and cyclists. And you'll see those themes come up again and again in the outreach that we've done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we didn't just limit the outreach in this project to large community convenings, though those were really a large requirement of the grant. So we did reach out to environmental justice stakeholders and as you can see, a very large number of community groups in drop ins to their their meetings as well as inviting them to the larger'",
        "'speaker_8': 'convenings. But we also engage the good movement industry and other government agencies, utilities and then specific T.I adjacent trucking companies, businesses that would be impacted by this just to get their initial take on what the issues were so that we could document those should the project project move forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There were additional things that would need to be studied. And just to wrap up about outreach, we celebrated the conclusion of the project process with an actual Open Streets event on Hill Street and again showed folks conceptual designs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Ask them to give us input about really what were the things that were most important to them. So we asked them a few times during the process pedestrian and bicycle facilities at the top and a planted buffer urban forest came in a close second.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This was about 86. 87 people provided us with comments. It was a well-attended event as really all of them were. I mean, you can see nature, plan, play, wetland, water cleansing area, native education gardens were the top five of interest to folks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as a result of of this initial work on this project, we have come up with a conceptual design concept. This is the illustrative of that. You can we've been looking north on all of the other graphics, but we're looking west so that the south is to the to the left.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'North is to the right in this view. And you can see that the view is dominated by planted buffer. The dark green area to the west is really that buffer, other native gardens and then road facility, a local road facility through the through the the space that could be a mirror and ring road that could help us'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to slow traffic, keep folks safe while they're in the space, but also provide eyes on places for folks to park. And then a connection that could be made at Hill Street in the center of the space as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and some of the active uses that were of interest to the community, like a skate area or a plaza gathering area, could be located there adjacent to the schools and really accessible by the kids. So just to conclude a few views that we did of the conceptual design, this is at 20th Street, an entrance that would'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be sort of north of the existing cloverleaf. So looking north and you can see the real focus of passive open space, the buffer to the west, areas in which we could capture water, cleanse it, handle stormwater, which is a significant issue on the west side as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you can see the the road access area, the parking and the the broad areas for folks to access and promenade on pedestrians and bikes. And this is looking at Hill Street, we're looking to the East and Hill Street is coming into the space again, connecting for vehicles, but also for pedestrians and bikes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And these are some of the play areas that we're envisioning, again, adjacent, accessible to the schools, areas for the community to use. And then for the north of the park, looking south near Willow Street, again, just areas for folks to use and enjoy in sort of passive ways.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And with that that strong open space buffer to the west beyond the roadway so that we can get get some great use. But but also separation, appropriate separation for safety and and for keeping folks safe in this in this space.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that is where the concept ended up as as a result of this process, clearly a very first step in in one of many that would have to be taken. And so in the implementation chapter of the of the study, we talk about next steps and we identify really that should the council recommend this were to go'",
        "'speaker_8': 'forward. The very first step would be to work with Los Angeles, Carson and the ports to develop a plan for goods movement. So we understand the importance of that and certainly the city is aware of that. And so there would need to be direct, direct consultation about that with with many stakeholders, additional outreach, with stakeholders, further design'",
        "'speaker_8': ', detailed design to get you to a more detailed level of design and start to consider operations, governance and and further funding analysis as well. An environmental review review would obviously be required and extensive likely. And so we've certainly identified that as starting a beyond year one and then really identifying a 3 to 7 year process, assuming it'",
        "'speaker_8': 'all really went forward stepwise and addressing funding operations and governance, design, implementation and maintenance. So that I think gives you an idea of where we've been in this project, and we look forward to your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilmember Gonzalez. Actually, let me go to the maker of the Motion Councilmember Your Honor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. So, as we can see, over a year ago, we initiated this process of going to the community of West Long Beach. Which this project takes most of the the space out there. And we ask the question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the Thai freeway were to be decommissioned between PCH and Willow Street, which becomes supported. What would you like to see there? And so there was a series of scoping meetings that were held at Admiral Kidd Park with a combination exercise or event and Hudson Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where some conceptual. Conceptual plans were developed about what the community would like to see if it were decommissioned. So where we're at today is that this is just a conceptual study as to what we would like to see if it were decommissioned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a conceptual plan that addresses many of the issues that are that West Bromwich residents face and that many of us take for granted in other parts of the city. We want clean air. We want better mobility. We want our schools to be clean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What are schools to be safe when kids go outside and play? We want to lower particulate matter. We want green space, more trees, bicycle lanes, people or passive parks where people can walk, walk through, maybe even with some exercise areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's also a plan which surprises me. Also maybe creating a wetlands area as well, which is awesome. I mean, it's just a comprehensive conceptual plan that would address many of the concerns that the residents have who live in West Palm Beach and who abut the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, having heard the presentation right now there is there are a lot of questions about mobility in terms of transportation. Where are those trucks going to go? What's the connection going to be? Where trucks near the port and heading north into the rail yards or into the other storage facilities and up the Alameda corridor?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How do we manage that? There are questions to be asked. So at this point, I'm going to to stop before I make my motion. But I would like to hear, obviously, from from for those who have an interest in this in this item here to hear their viewpoint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we can bring the discussion back and listen, my councilmembers would like to make their points known at that. That's certainly up to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Andrews, would you like to address the motion? Okay. So your request, Councilmember Urunga, is to hear from the public. Okay. Council members is that. Is that agreeable? Thank you. At this time, we'd like to hear from members of the public that wish to address the Council on item 24 relating to the Terminal Island Transition Plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. We're baby.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sitters. We were waiting for the timer. There we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All right. Good evening. Good evening, vice mayor and honorable council members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak again this evening. My name is Elizabeth Horn. I'm the executive director of Future Ports, and I'm here this evening not only representing future ports.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A historic coalition of labor, trades and business organizations here to express our concerns and and opposition to the decommissioning of the Terminal Island Freeway. Many of them are here tonight and will also be speaking in the history of the ports.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As far as we can determine, this coalition has never happened before. So we are very, very concerned about this. Earlier I sent a to get to each of you. Hopefully it's been distributed some letters, one from Senator Isidor Hull's office and then also our coalition letter.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One additional point that's not in the letter that I'd like to make is that even though that other freeways that have more traffic volumes have been decommissioned, as we saw in the presentation, none of them have been running through a port complex like we have here in Long Beach in the San Pedro ports.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's the largest port complex in the Western Hemisphere, not just in the United States. This is North America, South America combined. So comparing our Terminal Island Freeway project to other projects, we feel is more like comparing apples and oranges and not really relevant to in this case.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as we've mentioned, the Thai freeway is a state designated overweight corridor. The trucks would be diverted from the freeway to surface streets not combined and not designed for those trucks. One of the points that we'd also like to make is that with those 6000 trucks that we heard that would be diverted to those surface streets.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are overweight trucks now that those would be regular trucks and not for overweight. The one truck would have to now make two trips. So the 6000 trucks would probably be more likely like ten or 11,000 trucks in realistic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we want to make sure that we're familiar with what would happen to all those trucks. We do believe that a full environmental impact report should be performed if the city chooses to pursue the decommissioning. We are confident that the air would show that this freeway would result in rerouting traffic to surface streets throughout throughout the community'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and intensifying traffic already at those places. So we don't think this is a very well thought out plan. We'd like to see it go back to the drawing board with an in-depth traffic analysis and environmental review if it's going to move forward at all, which.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We hope it will.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not. So thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor Lowenthal and council members. My name is Floyd Bryan. I'm with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Southern California District Council. And we are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Opposed to this. Our closure for a number of reasons. And one of the main ones that I, I, I have trouble with is that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They say that there was so much outreach, community outreach. And I believe I asked Councilman Aranda how many people were in this district, and he told me 50,000. And about 50,281 people attended.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If you add all four meetings together and some of those people had.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Been to two or three meetings, so that 281 is a very, very small percentage of the people in the area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I have worked many years last 15, as a matter of fact, on environmental projects to make the port greener. This project is not going to necessarily make the port greener. You take those trucks are not going to go away.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They're going to be moved into a.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Non-Free away situation where they're going to be traveling on surface streets. And anybody who's done anything on the environmental end of this with truck movement knows that idling trucks are slow moving trucks, double and triple. It's exponential. It isn't just an arithmetic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Addition of particulate.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Matter and the particulate matter that they listed in 2011 has come down since then. In that area, we've worked real hard to bring that down, and we've got we're still working hard. But when I went to two of the presentations and we've written letters to you at their presentations, they weren't open to any suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We have some alternatives that we'd like to discuss. I mentioned Councilwoman Gonzalez. There are alternatives to this closure and or there are alternatives before this closure that aren't brought up at all. And to do this without.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'An E.R. is.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As far as we're concerned, pretty much, you know, unconscionable, really, because you're moving the stuff, you're moving the particulate matter, but you're not going to make it better. That's the problem. E.R. would show that, you know, there's no reason not to have an area that we can think of, you know, other than the fact.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That so, you know, push this through.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And, you know, we're we're against it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Giselle Fong and I am a resident of the seventh District. I am chair of the Environmental Health Workgroup of Building Healthy Communities Long Beach, and I'm also a City Commissioner with the Board of Health and Human Services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm here to tell you that we sent a letter to your offices through email so that you can reference that for more detail. But I just wanted to go through some of the main points of that letter, and that is to voice our support for the Green Tea Project, mostly because of its health benefits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you saw from the presentations that the residents that are adjacent to freeways and to the big industrial facilities such as the ports, the freeways, refineries are in in full and direct contact with the highest levels of particulate matter in our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we know all of the severe health impacts that that entails. We believe strongly that the Green Tea Project will create a health protective buffer for especially those residents that are directly on the fence line communities including students at Cabrillo, students at Stevens Mills Middle School, the all of the residents that enjoy the facilities at Hudson Park'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So we we do believe that there is an extreme health benefit for this green tea project. We also believe that the the truck traffic can can be with planning, with strategic planning to be diverted to the Alameda Corridor, which was intended for the movement of freight as a freight corridor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also just wanted to say that this is an area of the city that is very underserved. The West Long Beach has one acre of open space per 1000 people versus the east side of Long Beach, which has 16 acres of per 100,000 people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we do feel like this is an important community benefit for the west side of Long Beach. And lastly, I'll just wrap up that we did really appreciate the process that the meaningful community participation process where residents were asked and were given the opportunity division, what we wanted for our city, including the types of health and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'health benefits, the types of amenities that we wanted for our city. And we would encourage that the Council to support this project moving forward and to include meaningful community participation as we move forward. And we support the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The City Council to approve the green tie plan going forward and that we ask you to to direct staff to pursue next steps, including environmental analysis and identifying funding sources. Thank you.'",

My name is Mike Williams and I am the California executive director of government relations for the International Warehouse Logistics Association. I am here tonight representing a unprecedented coalition of labor, trade and business organizations to express our deep concerns and opposition to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the decommissioning of the Terminal Island Freeway. We have five local unions, two trade unions and one business organization together as one coalition unified in opposition to this project. Our association has been around since 1891 and this is the first time that the labor unions have jointly signed on to a coalition letter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This indicates the significance of the concern that we have as stakeholders in the community and in the warehouse logistics industry. We have raised many points of concern about the proposal. In our opposition letter one The Thai freeway is a state designed overweight corridor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Trucks would be diverted from the freeway to surface streets not designated for those trucks or the loads would have to be split and more trucks dispatched to keep within the legal weight requirement leading to increased truck traffic. Alameda and Anaheim Streets and PCH would suffer tremendous congestion due to the influx of those and other trucks on those'",
        "'speaker_11': 'streets and exacerbation of noise and air pollution. We had Melanie Smith provide a presentation on September 17, 2015 to our members that provided more questions and relatively no answers. You saw that presentation. Today was the same when we were presented.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Some of the questions raised included who would provide the billions in funding that may be required for the project? Is there an ETA for an air or traffic study or would the surface street traffic be diverted? Uh, has this been thought through?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When we would win. Would this go to vote, which is happening today? Possibly. But essentially, many questions were posed. Another important issue to consider. Is this a conflict of interest to have the former Long Beach city planner from 2014, the commissioner, her architectural firm, awarded the contract?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Were there any other groups that were considered? On page 72 of the city background materials what is being exempted under sequel? Does tonight's action exempt the project from Sequel altogether? So in conclusion, we would like to request an opportunity to have a full on workshop with a small group of representations, representatives from Labor and business to seriously'",
        "'speaker_11': 'look at alternatives to decommissioning the freeway. We think that we can look at a real solution and come up with compromises to achieve the goals of everyone efficient goods movement, better neighborhoods, equal economic prosperity and environmental improvements for everyone.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, council members. Vice Mayor My name's Joseph Sullivan. I work for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 11 in the National Electrical Contractors Association of Greater Los Angeles. And I'm here to express our opposition to the decommissioning of the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our contractors and electricians are doing a lot of work at the ports, electrifying the ports, making the ports more green, work on projects like LED lighting, retrofit solar projects, solutions for idling ships. And there's more work coming around microgrids, energy storage and resiliency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And these are good jobs. They're local jobs. They're going to local businesses. There's a project labor agreement for the Middle Harbor that requires local residents complete work on these projects. One out of every eight jobs in Long Beach is related to the port.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the port has a really important job engine and it's really important to our electricians and our contractors and the ports and the surrounding areas are being are becoming greener. We know that from studies, and we're working on these projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our apprenticeship program. The contractors and Labor are spending millions of dollars to prepare our workers to do this work. But removing critical infrastructure is not a viable solution. It's a wrong decision. One, it hurts competitiveness. Other ports would gladly take this cargo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And due to changes to the Panama Canal, they're becoming more competitive to do so. Ships are bigger. We're going to see larger bottlenecks. And what we're going to see is reduced productivity. And with reduced productivity, we're going to see less infrastructure projects, which is going to mean less greening of the ports.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right now, we're seeing terminal operators invest in greening their their areas. It's been mentioned. Where will this traffic go? It's going to go to surface streets. Do we know the air is going to become cleaner? We don't. It this you know, this is a little bit like moving homeless people out of a homeless shelter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It doesn't cure the homelessness problem. It just puts them in a worse position in some other area. And that's what we're doing with this cargo. So in closing, I'd like to say we're in the middle of an energy revolution, a technology revolution, and we're seeing new solutions all the time around, battery storage for electric vehicles, around fuel'",
        "'speaker_6': 'cells, natural gas solutions. And just closing a freeway is not. That's lazy thinking. There's other approaches and other solutions that are much more viable. It will create jobs and help this area to continue to thrive.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Alison Gallagher here on behalf of Assembly Member O'Donnell. I join others here today with several concerns pertaining to this project, including the outreach for this project has been limited, although it's been stated that there have been several community meetings and forums for stakeholder input.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Neighboring cities such as Wilmington and Carson have not been included on this project. As the Assembly member representing the harbor area and both ports, I want to ensure that we are including our regional and industry partners. In addition to the immediate communities surrounding the TY Freeway, we have not fully discussed all of the burdens that will be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'placed on the community communities surrounding the freeway. Further study is needed to ensure the continuity of the port's ability to move goods efficiently and timely. We need to ensure that other heavy weight corridors exist, and we need to ensure that clear route alternatives are in place to prevent truck traffic from going through our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also an environmental impact report should be conducted as well as transportation and economic impacts should be explored as well. I urge you to consider these concerns before moving forward with this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Vice Mayor Council members Pilar Arroyo with Watson Lane Company. Art Company's name was listed as one of those who had participated in the outreach. I've asked the city clerk to distribute a map for you because I think a picture is worth a thousand words.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The comments made by a number of the speakers expressing concern about this project, I did show them so I won't repeat them. When you look at this map, those areas outlined in yellow are Watson land companies, existing master plan industrial centers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It represents about 12 million square feet of industrial space. Been with the company almost 30 years. Most of this space is port related. I also serve on the California Straight State Freight Advisory Commission that has been a Caltrans led program to look at the importance of of goods, movement, infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think you are probably very familiar with that. And to have this concept and I understand recognized and it's been said over and over again that this is just a concept. But I want you to think about the unintended implications, the serious implications and messages that this sends to potential customers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Previous speakers have talked about competitiveness. What about the competitiveness of being able to attract? Customers that bring their goods through this port or other ports when they don't know if they're going to have that Terminal Island free way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it's not only about the overweight corridor, I might add. It's about the time inefficiency. And when you close down this major infrastructure or even send a message that you're considering doing it. Those start to impact decisions. And those decisions have serious implications in terms of jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have to think. Brodeur and not look at a conceptual project that, sure, how can anybody be opposed to something as beautiful as those renderings? The process has been really quite incredible. We in I personally helped with assembling a number of our customers to the meetings and the feedback we got back, and I didn't hear a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'word about the concerns that were raised. Serious concerns. Those customers are the employers. And like me, a Long Beach resident crosses that city boundary to work in Carson. So this is a huge, huge issue. And I ask that you take time to do this right, to not move in a direction that has unintended consequences.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'I'm also a Long Beach resident, very active in my community and very proud of Long Beach. And I think it's important that we don't cut off our nose to spite our face here. I'm not going to complain about the issues or raise more issues, but more talk about things that can be done so we can move forward'",
        "'speaker_13': 'to try to identify solutions, one of which is we need to identify other infrastructure projects that could replace the freeway moving forward. And it needs to be done in a meaningful way in a meeting and in concert with this, looking at this as well, because we need to make sure that we are not going to move forward'",
        "'speaker_13': 'with something while we don't have the funding or ability to put something in its place that could actually be better for both the community and for our goods movement industry. I think that's the first thing that's important, and the only way that we can do that is by looking at one, a complete traffic study from a regional'",
        "'speaker_13': 'analysis. That would be part of a secret process as well as a full environmental impact report to see what the consequences or unintended consequences of moving cargo and freight to other, more seriously impacted traffic.

        "'speaker_13': 'assembly and Senate committees on infrastructure, on on ports and good movement, when we're looking at how to reduce bottlenecks and invest in infrastructure in a way that we can create efficiencies that reduce air emissions. I think it's important that we take that to heart here locally as well.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Long Beach is home to the green port and we need to understand that that means moving a lot of cargo in an environmentally friendly way. What we need to do is take a look at how can we move this cargo in a way that may be quicker and does not impact the community in a negative way and'",
        "'speaker_13': 'identify each of those alternatives. I do have one question for this evening, though, and that's really within the entire packet. There is a negative declaration in that packet. And one of the big concerns we have moving forward with just a receiving file would be does that negative declaration that was filed in January of 2015 show as some'",
        "'speaker_13': 'sort of secret exemption for moving forward with this project? I think if if the project moves forward in any way, shape or form, there are certain studies, a complete air regional traffic study and also goods movement alternatives that be considered with it.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'and nature and skate areas. The open space element of our general plan states that the city should be establishing open space buffers between vulnerable populations and manmade and natural hazards, including those emitting toxic pollution.

        "'speaker_13': 'And while that urban forest is a great amenity and has been a great success, it's only the beginning and it's only a piece of the puzzle. We're very encouraged by the Green Tea Plan that's before you tonight, and we'd like to commend city staff, its consultants and the many community stakeholders on both sides of this debate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That have participated in what we believe is a very collaborative process. We think the result.'",

We talked about a lot of things, but what we didn't have is a plan or a vision or community input, and we didn't have that input from other parties as well.

        "'speaker_1': 'It's going to take a long time. I think a lot of the studying has just begun. A lot of the inclusion and the input from businesses has just begun. And I never thought I'd be quoting Bob Foster, but I remain of all people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. But when he when when someone said, well, think about Carson and Wilmington residents. Since when are our residents second class and have to take us are just are less valuable than other residents in this area and if we can't take care of Long Beach who can we take care of?'",

        "'speaker_11': 'But those are side benefits of what the primary driver that I've heard here tonight and through other presentations regarding the tie is that it's air quality. And the air quality test that has occurred occurred in 2011. It's been four years.'",

Not to mention the other green enhancements that the port has done. More green trucks. And I haven't that's not taken into full effect of what that benefits or those benefits are.'",

Because if you only move it a quarter mile or a half a mile to the east or to the west, is that the air currents could still carry the particulates back to'",

Right of way, transforming this last mile of the Terminal Island Freeway into a local serving street.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'It's insulting to the city development services, the staff, the consultants and all of the residents who have been a part of this process for several years to come here and oppose this project tonight. So I'm asking that you do not punish the residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You don't punish punish the residents of West Long Beach because people did not take the time to participate in this very lengthy process. So I'm asking you to move forward with this item as is. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, counselor. Laura Cortez, Long.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma. I also want to point out that we did have some community members that came by, also had to leave a little earlier. And I would also like to express my support for the Green Terminal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Island plan and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hope that you can prioritize clean air and environment, since this is what the community felt was important during the workshops. We all know that Long Beach suffers many health impacts, including 15,000 children with asthma, according to the L.A. County survey, and that the West has less park space than East Long Beach and is disproportionately affected by particulate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'matter, as was stated in the earlier presentation. Greening the tie would have huge positive impacts on the West, as you already know, and you have already, it seems to have a recommendation to move forward with this. So we would just greatly appreciate that you continue working toward it and continue working with other organizations to do so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor. City Council. My name is Leigh Fukui. I'm a resident of sixth district. I'm a founding member of regular is going green. It's a tree planting organization, also a member of Wrigley Clean team. And I'm a member of the city's Tree Advisory Committee.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I was kind of shocked at how many people came out in opposition to this. This is a park and it's a park that in a that's necessary in a badly neglected part of town. It's park poor. The residents are obviously suffering from high cases of asthma, cancer, etc..'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is all we all know this. So what is the problem? Why? Why is it that every time we have something like this that we have the unions come out? The truck drivers come out and say, no, no, no, that we want to keep everything the same.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Keeping every everything the same isn't the answer. We need to move forward. We need to create more park space. And there's very limited areas to do that. This is a smart plan. It's a good plan. It's a necessary plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We just had the forest wetlands open up and that's going to link up with the Mingus gap. That's going to link up with the River Link project, and that's going to connect to other parks that's necessary. That's what we have to do for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's what we have to do for our citizens. That's our responsibility. We can get there and we can get zero emissions, but we're going to have to sacrifice some things. It's going to be hard, but to say keep everything the way it is is not a solution.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's going to be sacrifices going to have to be made. The Clean Trucks program is working. The port is doing its best to make it a clean port. We're getting there. This is another as someone else said, this is another piece of the puzzle.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's necessary. We shouldn't be fighting over this. More parks are good. It's good for the environment. It's good for our city. It's good to attract more clean energy jobs and clean energy companies to here. How are we going to be attractive if we're if we keep looking the way we do?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean, we already have this diesel death zone that we're trying to shed. We have a number of hurdles that we have to shed in this city to get and attract those businesses. Those new entrepreneurs, they're looking at other cities.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Seattle. Portland. You're talking about losing port jobs. I'm sorry, but you know, that's competition. You are going to get competition from other ports that are opening up. But we have to see that and we have to encourage greener jobs to come here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's the future. I'm sorry, but thank you. Please move this forward. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good name.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vice-Chair City Council. My name is Tony Rivera, former.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Chair of the West Side. I just want to tell everybody thank you for the openness on this project. I staff and everybody else did a very good job. I went to some of the meetings. It was open to the public for everybody to assist.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was publicized very well. I got like three messages and 1.3 messages on the computer and all over the place. I know it was there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to mention is this piece of the freeway and I'm on parole, by the way. I'm proud of the project. So one little piece on the freeway is only going to affect a few people. This is only traffic is only going to the rail rail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has projects that is going to go through Alameda corridor. We spent over 280 millions on the line. I mean, a corridor. And they better use it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They better use it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In their road. Myself, I had trucks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have a business on the way, so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that we might have a problem. Too much traffic on PCH. We might need to consider later on on up in Anaheim. But the traffic today, it took me from Long Beach Freeway to Santa Fe just to get to my business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It took me 20 minutes. So I don't want to hear the other people. The way they.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Said it is going to create problems. Locsin has a legitimate concern, but I need to tell you, I'm one of the pioneers of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Weeds in Alameda is one of the correct roads to go with over weeds. They have a really good sound road. It's just a matter of changing it. When the project goes through, it has to be changed so they can get the weeds through there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right now, that's the only problem I see on the other ways I mention it to them, because they came in and they got they got a lot of business.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On the side of the warehouses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that doesn't justify to start the the project to benefit all these people that we've been suffering. I've been in almost 40 years and doing business or working with companies and it's time to work together. Union I'm sorry, but the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Union I love union and I love the longshoremen's. I got friends working there, but they need to get to work together to move more trucks at night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Quickly because I got people there waiting 5 hours on the port. There's a lot of contamination.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the contamination of these get done that the port.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is already clean. Let's cut that off. The rail is the problem. A locomotive that comes through there, the Union Pacific or anyone, there's not a black locomotives is contaminated like crazy more than the port or more than a lot of cars in combine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Council members give me this. Time to speak. As a veteran, disabled veteran from the Vietnam era. I enlisted twice, but I felt getting out of high school, I was in good shape. B Damn, what's going on?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So a lot of people getting drafted back in that area and I joined. I believe that I can serve my country in the way I feel in my heart that I can do. My attitude is grabbing the bull by the horns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Take care of action. A lot of veterans are the same way we came home. Even up to now, every company and you probably hear about it gets a $5,000 tax write off if they hire a veteran. A lot of the veterans, especially now the younger post-9-11 veterans, come back from Iraq, Afghanistan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, it's part of war. They come back not another percent PTSD or they do the arm or leg. These companies hire veterans. Because they'd done their job. You know, now we got to help them do their jobs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm proof of that. I work down here, but I because of my knees, I had to replace them. I'm like a 53 Chevy, you know, replace bar joints and stuff like that. But anyway, I don't have any grits and I don't have anything that's growing up in Wilmington.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm healthy. Stage shape, meet the right food. And I think that's the problem with this small community. It's shocking. I feel embarrassed by you guys discussing. I heard somebody say there's 50,000 people in that residence. Only a fraction of them show up here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So who's really concerned about the greenbelt? The people who work for them or the people they get paid to do the survey. I mean, these people here, here, they got good information. But you guys live in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Did they pay you good money? Okay. These people that live there, that Green Park. They get paid. I've been in a couple of villages and some of their. I got veterans right here and there. I help one to PTSD and I gave them Easter cards.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The kids go and there's officers. I'm pretty sure you'll have your office up here. Do you have air purifiers? Why not research the schools and the residents? They're paying rent. They don't own the houses. They're paying rent. Whoever owns those properties, they should investigate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a good job for you guys to do. Follow up on that before you start going with this. Put veterans out of work and the truckers and make sure those houses are up to par with. If it's, you know, progress is going to go forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You need to make sure those schools there have air, clean air, like you do in your offices up here. In the hospital air purifiers they suck all the the stuff to fly around in the dust, not just from the port, but from the house closing the people who own the property, they're not going to go.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That costs too much money. And for the to help the vetters keep their jobs and keep fighting them when they come home. They didn't get the Vietnam Veterans parade. I have not seen one. But yet the people were making sure that the young veterans come back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And take care of the veterans so it don't happen like us and you. My name is Jonathan Cassata. I am a chaplain. Vietnam Veterans of America, average life member and also now a Native American betters. I want to thank you all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I hope you really think about it. Investigate with the community, the houses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And time is up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I appreciate it. Apologize often. I'm a talker and I get frustrated. I talk and I thank you all. God bless you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening. Madam Vice Mayor and honorable members of council. I'm Richard Hines. I'm proud to be one of your five Harvard commissioners, and I know everyone's very tired. And I'll be very brief because I didn't write a long speech.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I did want to come down and clarify that the port and the Board of Commissioners specifically have not taken a position on the green tie. My comments tonight are just my views and they don't represent the Board of Harbor Commissioners.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I absolutely support, as my vote indicated, to help pay for a study and to support the West Long Beach Livability Plan. But the board, myself included, support our community. We're part of the community. I did want to mention, though, I mean, we've seen a lot of pro and con tonight, and I think we need to try and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'bring everyone together here. If we move forward with a study. It's going to be important that we look at replacement infrastructure. If you take out an overweight corridor that supports the movement of goods from our port, we're going to have to build new infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The good news is there is a project that would help tremendously. And Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez is the chair of the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, which I sit on the board with her. And there is a project that connects the Schuyler High Bridge directly to PCH in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The 47 flyover goes directly over Alameda Street, bypasses five stop signs and stoplights, creates snack grade separation for all the rail tracks. And. The reason why truck drivers don't use Alameda is it's not convenient. We need to make Alameda convenient as a true overweight corridor and have the ice ETF realign their gates to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And if there is a gig that will be built, that they be built on Alameda, their gates as well. You see, if we build this project, we wouldn't have the need to move 6000 trucks down the down the Thai freeway.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Right now, this project is $330 million. And I come here asking for your help because it's going to it's a heavy lift. It's going to take the city and the port. And we're going to have to engage the city of L.A. to work together to get $330 million.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have a green light. It was sued by the. There was litigation by the NRDC. And it's been we've won every lawsuit at the state level, at the federal level. We went through the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and won.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I only ask that we if we're looking at a study that we look at this project as well, because this is this is a real solution. If we can get our S.R. 47 flyover, then I think that a lot of the people that spoke in opposition tonight, they may be okay, because I think we have a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'real solution here. Anyway, that's all I have for you. Thank you so much. I know it's been a long night and you guys have had a lot of public comment and I'm happy to answer any questions if you guys have anyone to discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thanks, Rich. We will take it behind the dias. Sir. You've already know. No. On different issues. They were different issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sir, we cannot speak from we can't speak from the audience. Thank you. We've heard your testimony. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. I know where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's an unfortunate characterization. Thank you, sir. Please have a seat. Okay. I will take you behind the dias, Councilmember. Your Honor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. First of all, I want to thank everybody who spoke tonight on both sides of this matter. We're paying attention. We listened. We're going to discuss it. Obviously, there's there's a lot of emotion attached to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not an easy decision where we sit here and try to decide which direction we want to take on a matter that's so important to not only transportation and goods movement, but also to the residents of those areas that are going to be affected by it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In regards to the clean air and the mobility, that that is much needed there. I want to emphasize again what I said earlier. It's it's a a project in concept. It can change. And I'm pretty sure that it will change as we move forward with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we do, in fact, move forward with this, it's not a project already in place. The recurring theme that I heard tonight from both sides is that it's incomplete. There's still a lot more things that need to be accomplished.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I met with a contingency contingent of goods movement, people led by the Future Ports. Elizabeth Warren and I and I made a promise at that meeting. I said, if anything goes forward, we're going to engage them. We're going to go to the stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to make sure that they are involved in that discussion and participate in that conversation, because apparently there's been somewhat of a lapse, if you want to call it that. But this is one part in a long, lengthy process that's taking place, and there's a lot of moving parts to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we can go from A to B or to C or D without going through those steps. And this is one step in that process. So I want to make sure that, you know, that I want to make sure you know that I did hear you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there is information that's lacking here. We don't have a complete transportation study. We don't know what the effects of closing that one mile stretch of the to freeway will do to the goods movement. We need to know that if we're going to do anything at all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what I would like to do is to amend the motion to move that the city of Long Beach work with the cities of Los Angeles and Carson and the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to develop a plan for goods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Movement. Transportation. Without this segment of the to freeway and to fill any necessary gaps. I would like to move that. We continue more outreach with our stakeholders and provide a more detailed design and potential sources of capital and operational funding, including grants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would like to have a progress report on their movement within six months. So what I'm trying to do with this motion basically is say. Let's let's study it further. Let's move it along so that everybody who at the end of the day, we have all of the information that's needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're not just stopping here tonight. If we do not go forward, we do not go forward. There's nothing there. And everybody's at a loss and nothing happens. And it's it's status quo. We can't have status quo. We need to help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have to help people move their goods in an efficient way. I just heard about a solution right now with the CTA, which is which was a plan that was developed, what, ten, 15 years ago. So we need to move with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to endorse that project by endorsing this. So I, I made the motion and I hope I can help to have the support of my council members. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will. Thank you, Councilmember Urunga. So you've made a motion and it's been seconded by Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilman, with those, would you like to address the motion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I, too, want to thank everybody for being here. Everybody had some great comments in relation to the West Side. I know both Councilmember Suranga and myself are very much invested in the West Side and I know both business owners and residents alike.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know how much we all have endured many issues along the West Side. I myself live on the western side of the city, not the west side, but the western side of the city. I'm very proud to represent part of that, both industry and residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think this is a beautiful, beautiful plan. It certainly is. I think this is a very a plan that did incorporate a lot of community input. But I, I will have to agree with Councilmember Suranga that there are some missing pieces with that as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so not to say that this is not going to move forward, you know, that's not to say that at all. But I think there does need to be further discussion, further study so we can look at other pieces.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I myself personally did not get a briefing until two weeks ago. And it's unfortunate. You know, I know that my my staff member went to one meeting, but it's unfortunate that I was not personally briefed on this. And I you know, I don't know where the missing link was on that, but I feel that there needs to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be more. This is a it's a huge undertaking to have this put presented in front of us. And for us as council members to make a decision like this, I think there needs to be more information put in front of us, all of us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do have a few questions related to the plan. I do share the actor, the Alameda Quarter Transportation Authority. I also chair the i 17 Project Committee. I'm also on SCAD. I understand that it went to SAG back in July.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How does this marry with other governing board plans? I know that the S.R. 47, I don't think has been discussed, so it would be good to have that studied within the plan. But has this been presented to the I 710 Project Committee?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a question. The city manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Angela Reynolds. So answer that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe the answer is no.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'All right. So we've discussed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This with ACOG, but not specifically with the 710 Project Oversight Committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And so it would be good to do that as well or to have some sort of, you know, relationship with the two. Because I think it's important that all of these plans are put together. I want to see the cohesion of all of these plans and make it a very mindful and fruitful plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to include the I seven term project committee, which now actually includes the River Link plan, which is very important as well, especially to the West Side. Also as our 47, as we discuss and then as far as logistics, I still haven't heard a specific solution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know the traffic solutions perhaps that could be in the study, but there were there are 11,000 trucks going trucks and cars going down the RTI. So where exactly would be they be moved to?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, Councilman Gonzales, I think I can take a crack at that. It's about 11,000 vehicles estimated now. About half of them are trucks. So that's more like 6000 trucks at the Cloverleaf at PCH. They can either go east or west at this present time, and they do so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a heavily traveled route. They go west, they go to the Alameda corridor. They go east. They go over to the 710. But we have that's just a bird's eye view. We have not done any environmental studies. And the categorical exemption that is going along with this project is that it's exempt from security because it's a feasibility'",
        "'speaker_8': 'study and it doesn't have any entitlements or funding or anything connected to it. So if we proceed to do more study and more outreach, then comes the secure piece, which is an air, complete air. And we probably would also look at the federal side, the NEPA, the the NEPA view as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So those kinds of things won't come until we actually have a project description and we're moving forward. But they will come.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And so I just want to. And then outreach to other cities. I'll emphasize that as well. Of course, Carson City of L.A. to include San Pedro and Wilmington, of course. Again, just reiterating the fact that, you know, many of us sit on regional boards and to sit on these regional boards with other colleagues of ours that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are from other cities, it's important that we can speak to these issues, to speak to these projects very articulately, and that we can do so in a way that really works together with these cities, not just putting a plan in place and not having worked with them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilwoman Gonzales We completely understand, and that's really the first step, is all the logistics of getting everybody to the table. This was a high level concept with the community. That is what was funded through the Caltrans grant. We have it's even written in the implementation, all those other folks that we need to get together with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And then lastly, I know that, uh. So asthma, of course, is a huge issue. I know that the Port of Long Beach had, um. Were that was there any talk of reinstituting asthma programs from the Port of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I know that, uh, we had not been doing that anymore. So how. How was that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry. I'm having a hard time hearing you. Are you asking if we met with the Asthma Coalition or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, not the Asthma Coalition. I know the Port of Long Beach had been funding some asthma programs, and so it's no longer happening at this point. So I just wanted to see what the discussion was during these community meetings about reinstituting programs like that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that the that asthma program is run out of the Health and Human Services Department and in the West, Livable West, Long Beach Plan. We note that as an overall project in that area that we would like to continue to seek funding for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Councilmember, if I can add, we are very aware that the asthma program was funded by the community mitigation grants. That was part of that bucket of money that was distributed out as part of the impacts from some of the port projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that is coming to an end that grant cycle. And we have been having discussions with the executive officer at the Port of Long Beach over how important that program is and seeing how that can get restarted and refunded.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we know how much that cost? Uh.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't have a bit on my head, but I'd be happy to get that to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you. And I will support Councilmember Unger's motion on that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. So in the last few hours of discussion, I've been trying to keep track so I can understand both sides of this issue. So it sounds like the folks who are pro this motion tonight want a receiver file.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the folks who are opposed to this want to receive a file. The folks who are in support of this want a traffic study. The people who are opposed to this want a traffic study. The people who are in support of this one year fully air and seek peer review.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And people who are opposed to this want the same before air and seek review. But I have a letter from the city of Carson that, you know, asked for a detailed analysis to be done to evaluate the impacts of projects on, you know, of the project on traffic conditions, noise, air quality, vehicle, miles traveled, all these things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that I know are considered in a traffic study and environmental review. I have a. This green tie plan that I took the last 2 hours to highlight. And I'm just going to review page 61 says the later study phases of the Green Sky project will have to examine environmental and regulatory environmental issues, risks, potential mitigations and much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'more detail than has been previously addressed thus far because of the urgency and significance of these issues. It's recommended that environmental study be conducted as soon as possible to help determine the project's feasibility. Ideally, this should commence as soon as the project is defined to a sufficient level of detail.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Full range of environmental impact assessments from noise to air water runoff. A traffic analysis so significant for study. Further study is needed to fully understand all of the traffic implications which are discussed in more detail below. Neighboring impacts, particularly on residents and disadvantaged communities such as those in West Long Beach, Wilmington and Carson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A significant issue for further implementation of the Green PSI project involves the impact that reduced lanes and speed may have on traffic in the subregion and in effective adjacent neighborhoods and major facilities. So. So I guess my first question is, when did this document get when was this document circulated the actual plan?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When was this circulating? Or put put forward?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilman Richardson. Yes, that was posted on our website about two weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And since that was put out or even before that, have we actually reached out to the city of Carson City, Los Angeles, at all, at any point?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, I don't believe we have.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would say. I see. I just think we sort folks got ahead of each other and. I see. I mean, when you just take a step back and look at it. Everything folks are asking for is here. And it's not anyone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of these councils intention to circumvent any processes or to not speak to any of the stakeholder groups or any of the adjacent cities. But I do think because the cart got got ahead of the horse. I think Councilman Durango was right in saying that we should intentionally reach out to those adjacent communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, since we receive, we should respond to this letter what what they're asking for. This letter says City of Carson didn't receive any information. So we respectfully request request to be included in all future discussions, deliberations. We deal with their council members on different boards.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We deal with their city managers. We have a pretty good relationship with their staff. So I think it goes a long way to just pick up a phone and make a phone, pick up the phone and make a phone call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that would be my first suggestion coming out of this. And I think that the motion on the table satisfies that. And are there any challenges or legal issues with us picking up the phone and making a call?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Councilmember, if I can add, we agree with that point and we actually did speak with the Carson today. They called and asked for some backup on their on the project. And we explained what the next steps were.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the number one step, as you saw, would be to discuss if the plan moves forward to discuss with Carson and City of Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just to be clear, does any of the action tonight actually close the freeway or does it get us out of our square requirements whatsoever?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Richardson. No, it doesn't close the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We certainly don't ever want to circumvent secure and the environmental process. And we fully intend to do that and meet with all the other stakeholders and get it all done prior to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Ever thinking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'About closing the freeway. There's a lot of work still to be done. This, again, is a preliminary concept plan. We didn't reach out to a lot to other cities such as Carson, because it's just a concept plan coming out of the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I understand that. So my question now is about what's included in that next level of study. Tonight, we I heard about this flyover, and I can't say that I'm an expert on every freeway in that area. It's not my council district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not my job to be the expert in that area. But it sounded like there's a really cool project that the port is excited about. And and I know because of all of the history I know about skiing and the intention there is to remove or remove trucks and idling and all that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so will all of that be considered in the air or in the environmental study, the impacts to these other infrastructure projects?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely. There's a section in the in an ER where you have to look at all the cumulative project impacts and that would be including skiing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Now the next question, does what level of design or what level in the process does this project have to have to actually achieve before you can actually go through the air process? Is there a threshold like 5% design or something like that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would say 5 to 10%. But really when you start an environmental process, you have to have a fully vetted what they call a project description. So yeah, you would have to have at least 5%. 10 to 15 would probably be better so that you knew exactly what you were studying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And do we have that today?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, we don't.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there's no way we could have done that prior to now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No. Plus, this is a non funded I mean, the 250,000 from Caltrans was just to prepare what we prepared. There is no other funding associated with this project at this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So so those are my questions. And it's pretty clear to me that, you know, the community is divided on this particular will. Stakeholders in the community are divided on this. And particularly because the process has evolved enough to even get to the point of negotiating a place where, you know, different stakeholders are happy or you have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'consensus on the issue. Luckily, have you know, most of the stakeholders have consensus. So you halfway there, you've got labor and business together. So now you've got to figure out the rest. I would say, you know, I could see how since this is so new in that, you know, that's that's that brings uncertainty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I understand how that might be challenging for business or for port entries or how decommissioning a freeway or transitioning a freeway could be challenging or even scary. But that only underscores why we should study it even more, folks, to understand it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't I can't claim to understand it. And I think there is a deeper level of understanding that we need here, because I don't think anyone's going to argue that we need infrastructure. But I also wouldn't say that anybody's going to argue that we need environmental justice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just think we're a little bit premature in general to jump to. I support I have pros. I want to learn more. So I'm glad to hear that this action tonight does not stop us from having an absolutely full EIA seek review and traffic study.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's those are my comments and I'll be in support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Can I just get some clarification on the motion that's on the floor? From anyone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I could see vice vice mayor, members of the council. I was going to ask for clarification. I heard the amendment by Councilmember Urunga, but I believe if I understood it correctly, his motion is to receive and file the Green Terminal Island Transition Plan in accordance with the terms of the Department of Transportation grant and accept the categorical'",
        "'speaker_6': 'exemption, and then added to that directed staff to reach out to the additional affected community members and communities affected by this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I may, Mr. Park, and that would be specifically these asking for the city of Long Beach to work with the cities of Los Angeles and Carson and the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to develop a plan for goods movement that does not consider this segment of the freeway without this segment of the Terminal'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Island Freeway and filling us this very gaps. And I think the motion also went on to ask that we continue. Extended outreach with stakeholders and more. And provide more detailed design and potential sources of capital and operation funding, including grants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then you'd like a report back in six months. On the progress.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the. The key issue, I think, to the culture of looking at is, is the initial receiver filed a motion. My amendment was not to receive a file amendment was to to do this replace the receiver file with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I may, Councilmember, I you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what I heard you say. But then I wasn't sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vice Mayor and council, if I may. I think the council, it's requested here that you receive the documents in compliance with the grant terms and conditions and accept the category exemption. I think by identifying that plan and accepting it, it's complying with the terms of the money that paid for it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's a step that we'd have to take. And and then you can add to it the portion of your motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think my concern basically is that I don't want to spread this. I have to go on a shelf. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. Absolutely. I think that that's a concern that we may all share. And the receiving file terminology is actually quite awkward for the action that we're taking because it does sound like we're shelving it and that's not what it means.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you. Yes, I appreciate that clarification. And, you know, like my colleagues who spoke before me this evening, I'm very grateful for all the comments and the perspectives that everyone brought to the table tonight. I think it's really, really helpful for all of us and the decisions that we're making.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I understand this is a long term project and the funding source hasn't been identified. And we're really talking about conceptual planning right now, and I get that. But sometimes when we talk about conceptual planning, people start to get a sense of hope about a project and they want that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I get that. That's that's how it should be. So if we need to do any studies or have any sort of additional outreach, I think that needs to be clarified early so that everybody understands that we're going to go through that process if additional outreach is needed with the other cities or the other folks who have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'expressed concern and I share with Councilman Richardson, you know, it's not uncommon to hear from business or to hear from labor, but it is uncommon to hear from them together, expressing the same concern about something that is as important as goods movement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think it's definitely worth looking at and I just want to make sure that we're all clear that as this project moves forward, there's going to be an opportunity for all the stakeholders to be briefed and have the opportunity to have workshops and dialog.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that's the spirit of the motion. Councilman Urunga Is that the spirit of the motion? Okay, I think that's great because I think it's a beautiful design. By the way, the team that has designed this, it's it's a really a beautiful design and a beautiful design for an area that definitely needs it at this time'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So I think I will be supporting this motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. Thank you. You're not to listen to all of this. I think it's very important that all of us understand that this is a long ways down the you know, the pipe. But the thing about it, just like Mrs. Ewing made the motion, that it gives us hope.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that's what I think is so important, because the fact, especially in a district like mine, that's all most of our entire structure is about hope. And this is shown is something that I think if we do get to that point where we will find the money for this, I think it will be something that we'll all'",
        "'speaker_12': 'enjoy. And I want to think. Thank Mr.. Yeah. Your anger and and our colleagues here and I hope that they will support this as written. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I go?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I want to thank the councilman for expanding the input stage. I, I really see a value in looking at what a potential reduction of the type freeway's movement of freight could do in terms of additional bottlenecks, delays and the such that would cause additional idling and even more health hazards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I appreciate the hope that Commissioner Dynes brings us with a project that would pull the trucks out of the the freeway completely and do an on rail dockside rail option that could really improve the health and quality of everyone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that even today I was in a meeting for several hours where a group of neighbors wanted us to make a change, that all it did was shift the issue from their area on to their neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're looking for solutions that resolve things. So I'm really appreciative that stakeholders of neighbors, regional and industry partners will have a forum to have a discussion. I think that over the last several weeks I've talked a lot with the community about the process that council meetings have in which you have 3 minutes to make a point'",
        "'speaker_1': ', but the person behind you might make a counterpoint that you then don't have an opportunity to address because the format of which council meetings are is to allow for public comment. But the dialog and discussions that can be had at a stakeholder forum I think are the most important component of our ability to come up with solutions'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So with that, I'm going to be supportive of the motion and I am glad that we will be doing an air. I think that knowing and understanding the impacts on our neighbors is a really important component of our future, and I hope that we find a great way to move this additional freight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. And I want to thank all the members of the community and stakeholders that came out to speak to this item. I know. Although we are not taking action to. Decommissioned the freeway in the very, very immediate future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was important to each of you to have us understand where you're coming from. I wanted to touch on a couple of things that were raised by council members that I think are really salient points here. I know staff was duly taking notes on them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like to highlight a question that Councilwoman Gonzalez asked, and not because you did not hear it, but it is something that we value very deeply here. And that's a process we've heard about process for many members of the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and we do feel that a tremendous amount of outreach had taken place. And in outreach processes, it's difficult to ensure that everyone is included. But certainly we've heard from a lot of people today. And so these are these are the people definitely that we would include going forward in the continued outreach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As the amended motion asks for, but just our own process and my own understanding about our committee process. I've never served on the I 710 Freeway, but I do think Councilwoman Gonzales makes a very strong point that this is something that should be presented there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have committee processes for that reason. And and there's a perspective there that regards this issue in the larger context of the 710 Freeway and Council. Former Councilwoman Turanga served on that committee and chaired that committee for some time, and I believe she would agree that this is something that should go there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales, for raising that and and being honest and in letting us know that that had not taken place. So I think our internal process needs to improve as well. And the feasibility study is while it seems as though we are taking immediate steps to close this freeway and create the park space that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'indicate we'd like to. It is really a first step in being able to qualify to ask that larger question and consider that larger question. And so for members of the public that felt that this meant that this was much farther down the road, I want to assure you, unfortunately for many of us that work in planning, this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is the start of a very long process. And I think Ms.. Reynolds mentioned that earlier. And so community members that have been with us Saturday mornings and committed your days. Unfortunately, it's not over. It's much longer process than that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I ask all of you interested on either side of the issue to maintain your stamina and follow this project through? This is something that Mr. Ulysses Jeff Sky had mentioned to me in 2006. And so while it might be new to some of us, it's not new to all of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd like to thank you, Brian, for your ardent and strident advocacy of this issue. It is something that you have worked on for quite some time, as you have many other projects. And as a member of the community who many of you have commented that you don't get paid for volunteer time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will submit to you a lot of people don't get paid for their volunteer time. And Mr. Liszewski spent the better part of ten years advocating for this. And I live in the city. You live in the city?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is something that we can see through. It is not impossible to imagine where 11,000 trips a day can go, how they can be diverted. When a community inspires a will to improve its quality of life, they do think it's worth our attention and our time to take note and and allow ourselves to ask that question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this council is not afraid to ask that question, even if it is a process that will take ten years from now. So, Brian, I thank you for that. I thank you for never taking your eye off the prize and holding us to it.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You know, there's stuff like ShotSpotter we talked about in the past, and there are mechanisms being developed now that just attach to a light pole and provide the exact same, you know, where you can detect where a gunshot is in and triangulate that by having this technology built into the light pole.'",
