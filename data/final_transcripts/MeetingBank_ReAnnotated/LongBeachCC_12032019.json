    "Appeal, Environmental Review and Site Plan Review for the Long Beach Cruise Terminal Improvement Project.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And those will be the next two items ahead of us. So if I can also ask if we can just please close those doors so we can and that would be appreciated. If you'd like to take a seat, you are welcome.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so with that, I'm going to begin by having the clerk read Hearing Item 19.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report from Development Services Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and consider an appeal. Adopt resolution approving and certifying the mitigated negative declaration of environmental impact for the Long Beach Cruise Terminal Improvement Project and approve a site plan review for the onshore improvements of the Long Beach cruise terminal District two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And with that, if I can, please do we have an oath for this that we did administer?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you're a witness in this hearing, please stand and raise your right hand. Do you and each of you solemnly state that the testimony you may give in the cause now and pending before this body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Please be seated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. With that, we're going to have the staff report by city staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Mayor Linda Tatum, director of development services. We'll be providing the staff report. I'd like to introduce the project team for this item that is our our event or current planning officer Alexis or a peso. And the staff planner is Amy Harbin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She will be making the presentation for this item. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor and fellow Council Members before you this evening is a request to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude this public hearing and consider an appeal for a project consisting of an approval of improvements to the Long Beach cruise terminal in the Queensway Bay planned'",
        "'speaker_6': 'development zoning district. Although there are numerous assertions throughout the appeals, the most significant assertions are that the city did not consult with the Port of Long Beach on the project and that the baseline used in the study is faulty.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The project site is located south of downtown, adjacent to the port of Long Beach, and within about one half mile to the 710 freeway. Zoning on the property is planned development PD 21 and consistent with the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Louis Number seven Mixed use district primary access to the site is from Queens Highway and South Harbor Scenic Drive. Overall, the property is 103 acres, however. The city owned portion located on the east side of South Harbor Scenic Drive, is approximately 45 acres in size.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The site is developed with the Arms Queen Mary Hotel and tourist attraction. Catalina Classic Cruises. City of Long Beach. Aqua Link Island Express. Helicopters. A Surface Parking Lot. A six story parking structure. Harry Bridges Memorial Park and the Long Beach cruise terminal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The former Spurs custom Long Beach Fire Department station number six is also located on Pier H along the southwest side of South Harbor. Scenic Drive is Pier Gee, which includes a rail yard, truck, container storage, liquid storage tanks and refinery equipment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Included for context relating to the mitigated negative declaration. The maritime improvements include dredging the existing berth to a deeper depth and the proposed expansion of the leasehold area. Also included as part of the maritime improvements are the construction of two mooring dolphins and associated catwalks, the extension of the passenger walkway, bridge and fender replacements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Onshore improvements include the expansion of the parking structure to the south. A total of 417 new spaces. This area has been designed to accommodate vertical clearance for emergency vehicles per the US Department of Transportation Standards, as well as the city's public works department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The third through fifth floors part of the north expansion will include 240 spaces. The bus parking area to the north will be reconfigured along with the interior reconfigured drop off traffic lanes to allow for improved pedestrian access from the structure and drop off area to the check in area at the dome.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Each of the expanded floors has been designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing structure, and once completed, all levels will be accessible as one continuous structure. The existing tunnel will also be filled in order to accommodate the expanded structure and reconfigure traffic lanes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Planning Commission found that the project is compatible in design, character and scale with its surroundings, which include the adjacent recreational and tourism uses. The project's form and massing are designed to be consistent with the existing structure so that when finished will be one cohesive structure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Additionally, the Planning Commission considered and approved the mitigated negative declaration which analyzed both the maritime and landside improvements. The required findings can be made in the affirmative. Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, Sequoia and the State Sequoia guidelines, an initial study was prepared which determined the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration of environmental impact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'MDO 8-19 would be appropriate. The mitigated negative declaration indicated that no significant impacts would result from the project with the incorporation of an implementation of the stated mitigation measures. The City has been in ongoing communication and consultation with the Port of Long Beach staff since the project was originally submitted, as well as concurrently reviewing the project secret'",
        "'speaker_6': 'documentation to ensure adequate analysis of the whole action. The California Supreme Court has indicated that existing conditions will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an impact is significant. Selection of a baseline period at any other time would constitute the cherry picking of either lower or higher values than the current baseline'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The piece mealing of a project occurs when a project is broken up into smaller pieces to avoid environmental review of all the impacts of the project as a whole. Staff recommends that the City Council receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing, consider the appeal and adopt the resolution approving and certifying the mitigated negative declaration'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and uphold the Planning Commission's decision to approve a site plan review. And this concludes staff's presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. With that, we do have some appellants. So because we have five appellants, we are going to be giving each of the appellants starting off 5 minutes. And then I think we have the we do have a coalition of some faculty, so they might get some longer at the last.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Appellant But if I can please have a Jeralyn Mendoza Please come up first. And then after Jerry Mendoza, I'm going to have citizens about responsible planning. They'll be second. Please come forward. He's Geralyn Mendoza here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. Mayor, city councilmembers. My name is Chris Chavez. Obviously not Geralyn Mendoza. She had a medical procedure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Done today, so I'm speaking in her place. I am the deputy policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air. I am also a resident of the City of Long Beach. Coalition for Clean Air filed this appeal because our concerns are the organization of the merit mitigated negative declaration seemed like inappropriate piece mealing of the project such that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'landside improvements were under the Planning Commission in water site improvements were under the Port of Long Beach. However, the city of Long Beach, through the Planning Commission and Planning Bureau, is the lead agency for Sequa for all purposes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city cannot make the Port of Long Beach in charge of water related.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Issues for the purposes of the terminal expansion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Project. Additionally, the Port of Long Beach has not formally considered the expansion project or contributed to the city as a responsible agency under sequel. The Planning Commission made its decision without a written report, written briefing or any other contribution in writing from the Port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And nobody from the Port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Spoke at the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'November 7th Planning Commission meeting or to our knowledge, attended the meeting. The Commission made its decision without any deliberate port of Long Beach expertize on the water related improvements and its potential environmental impacts. Therefore, the Commission's decision was premature and based on incomplete information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We therefore request that the mitigated non mitigated negative declaration be revoked in the Port of Long Beach, be allowed to appropriate time to review and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Analyze the environmental impacts of the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before a final decision is made by the Planning Commission. As secure as a secret lead agency, it's important to note for Coalition for Clean Air part, we do not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Oppose this project, nor are we trying to stop this project. However, we want to make sure that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seep was adhered to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As strictly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach, as we know, has some of the most polluted air in California and in the United States. There's a lot of efforts going on at the state level, the local level, to try to mitigate some of those longstanding air quality concerns by ensuring appropriate adherence to the secret process will help build and reinforce the trust between'",
        "'speaker_0': 'local agencies and the constituents that those agencies serve.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Next up is our citizens about responsible planning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Before I begin, Mayor, I am going to be speaking for both carp and. The Sierra Club was Cerritos Wetlands Task Force. So may I have 10 minutes?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Have you down for both? You're going to be that. Are you going to be the sole speaker for both?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No. Coral Inslee is also speaking for carp.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So carp in total only has 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is control if you want to speak. And I'll let Ms.. Ms.. Lee also speak. But it needs to be within 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Within the 10 minutes, correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. I do have you down for both.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Citizens about responsible planning. Caap and the Sierra Club Most Serious Wetlands Task Force are appealing the Carnival Cruise Expansion Project as we contend it needs a full environmental impact report to address the inadequately mitigated environmental issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These include air quality kelp forests, marine mammals, birds, fish habitat, noise, light toxic materials, disposal of dredge materials and adverse environmental impacts. The Carnival cruise ships have not only on our port and the city of Long Beach, but on the entire ocean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The staff report base its recommendation to deny or appeal on a claim that evidence on the record does not support our appeals. However, to support. This claim staff provides only one letter attachment K in your packet, which was not written by the city as lead agency nor by the negative declaration preparer, but by attorneys for the party'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of interests. Carnival Cruise. Perhaps this utterly unprofessional and biased approach. Besides this utterly unprofessional and biased approach the staffs report claim is quite mistaken in substance. At the Planning Commission on November seven three, submitted on the record many substantive reasons why statements in the negative declaration are inadequate and therefore a full environmental Empower Pack report is needed'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Both Carp and Sierra Club Task Force agree with all the concerns of the other appellants. But because of shortage of time, I will address only a few. The conclusion to the negative declaration states The project area is within one of the busiest ports on the West Coast, within highly modified habitat.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In spite of the generally degraded habitat, a few special status or sensitive species are present or potentially present. The small number of sensitive species lists 16 different birds from pelicans to herons to terns, nor known to forage and nest in the project area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Six listed or special statue marine mammals from whales to dolphins to sea lions have a moderate to high potential to occur on site, according to the noise study. Unmitigated underwater noise impacts to marine mammals may occur during pile diving, driving and dredging activities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what is the mitigation for these endangered birds and mammals? From the negative declaration. I quote, during pile driving activities, the construction contractor shall utilize a soft start initiation of the pile driving equipment at the beginning of each day, or following a 30 minute or longer break in pile driving.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Driving to give nearby wildlife a chance to vacate immediate construction area before full force pile driving is initiated, unquote. Chasing birds and mammals away from their nesting and foraging area is not mitigation. Another concern are the kelp forests.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The negative dex states quote, The major species of brown algae or kelp in the Long Beach Harbor are giant kelp and feather boa kelp. Surveys in 2013 and 2014 identified kelp beds growing along the outer faces of pure j and both faces of the breakwater just south west of the project's existing berth and docking area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As such, it is possible that kelp beds in the project would be impacted by the present project. Constructive activities. According to Dr. Rogers Bennett of UC Davis Bodega Marine Labs, the long time relative stable northern kelp forests have essentially been almost completely wiped.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Out of control employment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Over the last decade and will take many decades, if ever, to recover.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. Centralia, if I know if I'm into next Christmas, you know you're going to be the next I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was given 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That you do five for you and five for Mrs. Christensen. That's what the mayor was telling me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As I understand it. Let me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Clarify. Thank you. So I think we have 10 minutes total for both groups and so. Ms. Control anything you don't use in the next few minutes? Mr..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I would like my clock to be stopped while we discuss this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll give you that. Those, those time to worry. So just continue. But whatever is left over is what Ms.. Lee will be able to use for the rest of the time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'May I ask a question? Isn't it true that at appeal hearing are the appellants are allowed to present all of their arguments in case there is a lawsuit?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're absolutely able to continue, and I'm not going to cut you off, but I'm trying to, because we have so many appellants. I'm asking folks if they can stay within 5 minutes. Please. There lies a reasonable amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so please continue. And and hopefully within that amount of time, you can also hear. Ms.. Lee so just please continue. I'm not going to cut you off.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Am I getting my time back? No. Cost over.'",
        "'speaker_11': '$100.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Kelp forests anywhere are a relative rare and precious resource. One study found that along with removing carbon dioxide from the water, kelp is creating a defense against acidification. Mitigation measures? Incredibly, no mitigation measures are required for the kelp forests.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Another big concern are the hazardous materials lurking in the dredged materials. I won't go into all of these that are there, but they include. Zinc. Arsenic. Copper. Nickel. Cadmium. Mercury. Dee dee dee dee dee ni and they were all elevated above the Los Angeles port reference sediments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Conclusion of the report states. Therefore, there is a moderate chance that the carnival sediments would cause significant toxicity to marine amphipods. The conclusion of the negative declaration appears to ignore the results of the study and are willing to submit marine life to the dangers of multiple toxic materials.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For this reason alone, this project should not be approved. However, there is more and carelessly will tell you. What comes next. Okay. So in this negative declaration, they talk about being able to safely moor the larger cruise ship at the existing berth to improve safety at that berth related to ocean swells.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if you go online, you'll find that they have been advertising tickets for these sailings up to a year and a half ago starting this month. It's been confirmed with Matthew Armes, the environmental director of the Port of Long Beach, that they will dock the panorama at the same location as the other cruise ships.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Either there isn't a safety issue or they are disregarding the safety issue. Also, if you look at the environmental issues in this city, if you look at that chart I had put up there, that's the coal enviro screen scores.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And over on the left side, you'll see the port and going north, going up the 710 freeway. And you see all that red and all that red is basically saying that we have very we have the worst air quality in any city in the state.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So shouldn't be carefully consider a project that brings with it additional pollution. According to USA Today, a study of four cruise ships, including two of Carnival's ship exhaust, contains her harmful constituents, including metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which have toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic properties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we really expect the people on the west side of Long Beach to live with that? They don't deserve it. Moving on, it says that there are speed requirements going into in and out of Mexico. And once again, if you look at the staff report, it's saying that that they use that for schedule issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So is the schedule more important than our air? Also in terms of shore power, they are required to use shore power when they're inside the the port here. But the problem being that Stefano Barzani's spokesman for Carmel Carnival, admitted that of the five ships currently coming to Long Beach each week, only four are equipped with shore power'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I'm going to summarize here that at the end that, yes, money will increase, more taxes will come to the city if you approve this, but weighed against our residents health, we ask that you choose to support city residents their health and quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. As Christians say that you have. Okay. Then we're moving on to our next speaker, which is Mr. Marquez. And I want to just make sure mislead. I know your time was up because I also told this control.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you complete everything you wanted to say? Okay. Thank you. All right. Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My name is Jesse Marcus. I'm the co-founder.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And secretary to the Coalition for Safe Alignment. And if you've seen our documentation, I also represent nine other.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Groups which represent a wide spectrum.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of society and members of the public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I want to speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With you about and describe with you is what's not being told to you. For some reason, this is a project that's been put on a super fast track. It is already behind schedule. But then here's what's not being told to you as an addition to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Both the California Air Resources Board and the South Coast Air Quality Management District submitted public comments in July and in September, both of them describing in detail the inadequacies of assumptions of the assessments and estimates of the emissions and the mitigation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City staff ignored them. So here we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The two predominant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Regulatory agencies saying there's things wrong with this and yet it moved forward without that. That's what's not being told to you. You heard just mentioned about the shore power. Yes, it's in there that they will be short powered and they will hook up and plug in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But not today. Not tomorrow. A terminal cannot do it. Today or tomorrow, it will be a while before they get to it. You could give me a year or two before they even get to it. Those are concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In talking about mitigation. We have come to all agree, as appellants and many of our members, that city staff did not have an ongoing, continuous, in-depth discussion with the Port of Long Beach about this negative, negative declaration. Because when it comes to the subject of mitigating impacts, they did a very poor job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Both CARB and IT Committee also stated that our organization publishes a document which is a survey of all zero emissions transportation vehicles, cargo handling equipment, construction equipment, and we provide it to at least five six executive management at the Port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they are fully aware of what is available. Yet city staff. Claiming that, you know, they need to be able to purchase pushing credit somewhere else to offset impacts is not true. Even though it mentions they will be using electric dredging, Carnival already mentioned that there's a probability that the dredger will not be available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Even the attorneys Piper LP said, Oh, well, the three dredger manufacturers la la la la. Well, actually there's five. And this project is not a new project. It's been on the books. Port of Long Beach, City of LA could have gotten a cap and trade grant, Proposition one grant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They could have gotten a Carmelo grant, they could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have gotten a deer grant and several other grants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And worked with a dredger service provider provider to be able to have it available when you needed it. We all signed contracts to deliver services. You're behind already now. So come the time that you need to use it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It may not be available because you have no contract with them to do that. And since the ship cannot plug in today, tomorrow, or maybe even for a year or more, there is a technology. It's called Inec's Advanced Maritime Emissions Control Technology.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has already been used on over 300 ships at the Port of Long Beach alone. It is certified by CARB. So it's not unknown. It is feasible. It is cost effective. And it is readily available right here at the ports.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they use it all the time. But yet there is no contract to use them. To protect the public from emissions. There are also we claim that there are underestimates of the emissions. Well, yes, if you read the CARB letter and the and the Archimedes letter, they describe the areas where it's missing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in addition to that, there are other things that you don't know and city staff would not necessarily know, for example. When a cruise ship comes here, there's trash. Well, you don't see the barge going to the ship to unload the trash.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't see the emissions from the lift to take it off the ship. You don't see the fuel barge and its emissions as part of that. So we're saying we're not against the project. We're asking to delay and redo the air as required under sequel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Marquez. And then I have Andrea Ricco, I believe. Yes. Please come forward. And I know if you want to go beyond the 5 minutes, you're.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Welcome to do so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. I'm Andrea Ricco. Professor emerita from USC Keck School of Medicine, representing concerned academics from USC and UCLA. I would like to raise a number of issues and I'm sorry, I've had a cold for two weeks, so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'See if I can do this. Despite claims and several others have raised this city of Long Beach, staff did not appropriately consult with the Port of Long Beach on strategy for the sequel analysis. I've had multiple conversations with port staff over the last six months.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They personally told me that the city of Long Beach was handling the environmental review differently than the port would have handled it. For example, the Port of Long Beach said there was no need for a secure baseline analysis, which is the main thrust of the thrust of what the Port of Long, Long Beach planning staff did.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the public and government agencies, including Axiom D and A or B and dozens of community groups that signed on to a letter that the faculty at USC wrote spent weeks analyzing that secure baseline when the Port of Long Beach later said, That's not the way to have done the sequence analysis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a really horrible thing to do to the public. To publish a document that required that was so faulty in its analysis. That required has always been weeks analyzing it. And then the Port of Long Beach and Carnival later says, Well, we didn't really need to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We just did that or whatever. So the Port of Long Beach said that that was not an appropriate way to do that. So they were not consulted by the port of by the city of Long Beach staff. I forwarded the Planning Commission hearing notice to the Port of Long Beach top environmental management staff, and asked for a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'call about it. And they told me that my forwarding them, the Planning Commission notice was the first they had heard about it and that they had not seen the Planning Commission notice that talked about the Harbor Commission having a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is not what I would call proper consultation and it resulted in no in an opaque process and lack of ability to engage on this issue with the Port of Long Beach. Secondly, we argue that the analysis that the psychoanalysis that the Long Beach staff did City of Long Beach about the comparing the new panorama with the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'polluting Carnival Splendor was completely faulty. First, Carnival brought the Splendor back to Long Beach after I'd been gone for four years. Why do they bring it back? Do they think that that would be a good comparison with a ship that plugged into electricity so you could prove that the new ship was going to reduce emissions?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's no reason why Carnival brought the polluting Splendor back to the port of Long Beach. So again, we spent hours and hours and weeks analyzing all of the analysis presented by all of the environmental consultants to the city staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the Port of Long Beach later said there was no need to have done that. Third Carnival refuse planning staff for months by saying that Panorama had a Tier three engine, which has the cleanest engines that are currently available.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I did a Public Records Act request and I received 1500 pages of city documents. So I've seen some communications back and forth that probably you have not seen. On May 28th, after months and months of emails going back and forth, consultants told us, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Pan Carnival told City staff that the Panorama was actually a Tier two engine, not a Tier three May 28. That's three weeks before this MMD was published. So one of the consultants wrote an email to the city staff saying, We don't know what to do here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All of our all of our emission calculations are based on this cleaner tier miraculously cleaner tier three engine. And all I know is that that was three weeks before the Mandi was published. And I find it hard to believe that after working six or eight months on their document, that the consultants revised all of their emission calculations'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in those next three weeks in time to publish it. Part of the confusion is when it is a way that you can get around the International Maritime Organization rules. They starting January 1st, 2016, they require that all new Marine oceangoing ships have a Tier three engine if they were going to enter North American waters like here in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long Beach. And so that started on January 1st, 2016. But Carnival bought this keel ten days before January 1st, 2016, so that they could get the grandfathered rules and have the Tier two dirtier engine. To me, this raises questions about whether Carnival Cruise Line really cares about public health in the environment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you know, I have a PowerPoint. I'm sorry. It's not being shown. I submitted this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have the one we have in front of us. Can you can we go through the slides really quick? Ones that we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I probably like on slides eight or something. Just go through it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll tell you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who's going to do that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. The Port of Long Beach should have known about this issue, that the tier that this was a tier two ship because in the 2017 update for the camp, the port said they were well aware of this method that the cruise that ships were using, ocean going vessels were using to use the earlier keels that were laid'",
        "'speaker_6': 'before 2016 to get to grandfather in these old keels and be able to use tier two engines instead of Tier three. So get this, in December of 2015, the carnival puts this keel on the ship, says it's starting to be constructed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ten days later, the new rules start. Two years later, Carnival starts manufacturing the ship. And again, I say, you know, were the calculations about whether it was tier two or two or three really considered by the consultants? With regard to mitigation measures.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a failure to demand that tug, that two or three tugboats be used, two or three engine tugboats and the visas were not available. So you can't make Carnival have to use something that's not available. And it's clear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've got notice if you go through my comments that I gave you, there's notes from staff that says from Carnival, it says, we will not commit to tag three. Two or three tugboats. So then, as mentioned earlier, someone from the Piper law firm representing Carnival criticized me for demanding that Carnival use Tier three tugboats for dredging.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they said they're not available. And if they're not available, you can use emission credits. I found in the Public Records Act and an email to staff from that same person, Marshall Taylor from the Piper Law Firm saying emission reduction credits are not feasible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would cost Carnival $30 million to buy emission reduction credits. So here we are. Tug three engines are not available, can't be mandated. Let's use emission credits, but emission credits are not feasible either. Behind the scenes, there's not a word about this in the in the Mandi, nor is there a word in the media about the fact'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that it's a tier two engine instead of a Tier three. And finally the end that there were a lot of dredged materials and sediment that ended up being dug up from doing all the dredging that's required to bring in a big ship like the panorama, which is the biggest cruise ship in the world.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The analysis in 2018 showed that the dredged materials had moderate contamination. So the question is, where do you dispose of them? Where do you dispose of that dredge material? There also had been analysis from the cruise terminal in 2009, and that's in the document that's in the M.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's not like I found it and some crazy places in the mandate, so everybody had access to it. If you look at 29 to 2018, the the contaminants are dramatically higher in 2018 than they were in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In 2018, the decision by EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers was that it's okay to dump this stuff in the ocean in 2009 when the levels were a lot lower. EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers said it's too toxic to dump in the ocean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just would raise questions about whether we should have some kind of neutral person evaluate these dredging contaminants or whether there might be something going on. You know, with the current administration, which recently revoked the National Oceans policy, is there something going on that's saying let's let the more contaminated stuff just go ahead, we don't have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to worry about it like we did ten years ago. And I've got examples of those metals in here. And I say arsenic level found arsenic levels. You know, you have this ocean dumping site called L.A. two. And so the analysis shows what are the chemicals like?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What are the contaminants like at the L.A. two ocean dumping site? And what are the contaminants like that you're finding right now? So arsenic was 1.5 to 4 times higher. Lead was 14 to 16 times higher.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let my last sentence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Why aren't you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Continually and there were no there were currently no detectable PCBs at L.A. two. And the levels of PCBs in the Carnival Cruise terminal sample exceed the the threshold, the lower threshold limits for what is okay to dispose of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think some neutral party really has to look at what's happening with that dredged material. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. We're going we're continuing on the on the hearing. We do have both public comment and of course, the carnival is here. Also who they get or they're making it seem as if they like up to ten or 15 minutes since there's one person and the five appellants is a representative from Carnival wants to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'make any comments or any rebuttals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening. Honorable Mario Garcia, member of City Council, city manager and staff we. My name is Stefano Bersani. I do global development for Carnival Corporation. We are proud to be here tonight in front of you to represent our company in doing so, in full respect of the appeal process in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would like to introduce executives from Carnival. They are joining me today and partners. We are working messe commercial director, head of long beach operations. We have Vicky Ray, vice president of Guest Care and communications. We have Terry Taunton, senior vice president of nautical and port operations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right behind here, I have John Africa, senior Vice President of Maritime Policy and Analysis, former US Navy officer. And then I have Andrew Brady right behind me and Marcia Taylor from DLA Piper. At this point, I'd like to ask Andrew Brady to please come up and address the legal brief we have prepared.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Good evening. Honorable members of the Council. My name is Andrew Brady of DLA Piper on behalf of the project applicant Carnival.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'First, I want to note that we did submit a as a reference.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before a detailed comment letter that addresses the appeals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Point by point. I'm not going to address the full detail of those comment letters, but I do want to go through a few key points.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First, in order legally to demonstrate that a mitigated negative declaration is invalid under SEQUA.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The California Environmental Quality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Act, the appeals would have to show that there is substantial evidence in the record and a fair argument, a fair argument of significant environmental impacts supported.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'By substantial evidence in the record that despite.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of the detailed analysis in the media, that this project would nonetheless result in significant, unmitigated impacts on the environment. The appeals filed before the Council do not meet that standard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They fail to meet that burden.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They, rather than address the substance of the amend its supporting expert technical reports or any of the evidence in the record, the appeals merely criticize in cursory fashion with no citations to the record and zero evidence that they want the city to have done the analysis differently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is not nearly enough to establish a square violation. And now here tonight and at the 11th hour, the appellants have submitted new information and arguments that address a number of issues that are simply not relevant to the scope of this fairly modest and limited project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will briefly address some of the germane issues that were addressed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'First, with respect to hazardous materials.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would note that the M.A. has in support as an appendix, a detailed dredging soils report that includes analysis of the soils that are to be dredged and disposed of here. The city staff. The city's expert, circuit consultant, the United States EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of Long Beach, all determined that these contaminants'",
        "'speaker_0': 'were at levels that were safe for disposal at a designated disposal site. That is that is more than enough for the city to have correctly concluded that in Mandi is appropriate and that these impacts would be less than significant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it is supported by the conclusions of a number of different expert agencies on the issue of school piecemeal. The comment respectfully misapprehension would seek what piecemeal actually is. They say that because there are separate approvals from the port in the city, that constitutes piecemeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is not what piecemeal as piecemeal relates to the analysis of the whole of the project itself. Many projects require approvals from different government agencies. That does not render cycle analysis invalid. A cycle analysis is supposed to analyze the entirety of the project itself, and that is what this analysis does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Staff did briefly address the baseline question. I will just say that the standard under Sequoia is to analyze as the baseline, the currently existing conditions at the time the environmental analysis is conducted. That is what this memo does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is the standard under secure and the mandate here follows that standard. Beyond that raised the issue of emissions reductions credits. That is a mandatory mitigation measure of this project and statements that it is going to be prohibitively expensive or actually incorrect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carnival's taking on that as a mandatory condition for this project that it must meet in order to get the permits. Finally, the use of two or three tugboats, it is it is analyzed and determined in the manner that two or three tugboats of the size required for the work here, maybe, maybe unavailable, but where available?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The project is mandated to use them. That analysis is in the Mandi. It accounts for it and the Amandi concludes, including that analysis, that the impacts of the project will still be less than significant. Finally, just to correct the record, the statement that the MMD does not analyze the engines that are used in the ship is incorrect'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The MEHNDI was revised and recirculated. The remedy does a properly account for the type of engine that is used in the Panorama ship. So, you know, there's there were there's a wide variety of other claims and issues raised in the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Happy to address any questions the Council may have regarding those additional issues. I would just note that, you know, an M&A is eminently appropriate for this project. This is a project that actually results in substantial environmental benefits insofar as it enables Carnival to bring in the use of a new, more efficient ship that's going to be able'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to connect 100% to shore power, and it will be able to connect 100% to shore power on day one. There is no delay. The project only involves approximately seven weeks, only seven weeks of berth, modifications and dredging, while still allowing vessels to be safely handled during construction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Based on these facts, we concur with the conclusion of the staff and the Planning Commission that the MMD is appropriate and fully complies with the requirements of sequel. On that basis, we recommend that this Council uphold the decision of the Planning Commission in denying the appeals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will now turn the presentation back to Mr. Barroso. Thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Don't steal my paper. Thank you. Thank you. Andrew, with regard to our commitment to sustainability and the specifics of a carnival panorama, I'd like to ask John Heffernan to please join me and approach that element of the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor and Council Members. Thanks for the opportunity to say a few words. My name is John Heffelfinger. I'm senior vice president of Maritime Policy, and I also oversee our corporate sustainability efforts for the corporation. And I'd like to just provide a little bit of context, if I could.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'll keep it brief. For context, Carnival Corporation currently operates 104 ships around the world. We call on over 700 ports annually. Long Beach is obviously a very important one of those. We operate nine brands. Carnival Cruise Line is the largest of our nine brands, operating 27 of those 104 ships.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As a going concern. We fully recognize that our future depends on operating safely, obviously, and on the health of the world's oceans. So it's important for us to employ solutions that manage our impacts. Our approach to sustainability has really been about continuous improvement and I'll explain a bit more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In 2015, for the first time, we went public with a series of sustainability goals for 2020, and next year we expect to attain or achieve all of them. One of our top priorities is ongoing improvement in energy efficiency, and associated with that is air emissions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Obviously, since 2005 as an entity, we've achieved an efficiency gain of more than 27%. We've invested over $500 million in advanced air quality systems designed to reduce sulfur and particulate emissions. We were the first cruise company in the industry to make an investment and it's an ongoing investment in LNG powered cruise ships.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We took delivery of our first cruise ship recently. We have ten more being built. We're also investing looking forward to a carbon neutral future at some point in low or zero carbon fuel potential. Right now. That includes a large scale battery potential, as well as fuel cell and other new fuels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But there is no silver bullet here. As a few other examples of our sustainability efforts, we've committed to reducing the purchase and use of single use items, including single use plastics, and we have a goal to achieve at least a 50% reduction by the end of 2021.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're also investing in new food waste processing technologies, and we have comprehensive recycling programs on board. And every ship in our fleet has a full time environmental officer employed. Lastly, I'd like to mention that we also lead the cruise industry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In the percentage of our fleet that is shore power capable. And that leads me to Panorama. As already mentioned, Panorama will connect to shore power while in Long Beach. And she has the newest technologies in many areas, including advanced wastewater treatment systems, food waste treatment systems, heating and air conditioning, efficient systems, lighting technologies and hydrodynamics.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Compared to the ships she is replacing. She's more than 40% more efficient on a per person basis despite being larger. She also has an absolute lower carbon footprint. We're excited and proud to have called Long Beach home for many years, almost 20.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we look forward to continuing the positive relationship. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anything else to add.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just wanted to close very quickly in again stating we look at Long Beach is on a top three ports globally. It is a huge and critically important hub. We believe the partnership we have had for over two decades has been nothing short of amazing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We look forward to that. Continuing well into the future. We're bringing our very best ship, our newest ship just built in Italy a month ago. Coming straight here. We are very excited about the arrival of Panorama. We're very proud of the introduction of this new ship.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As far as we are concerned, the arrival of Panorama represents a 100% improvement from the ship it replaces from all vantage points in all areas of of review. We also like to underscore is it is unique to bring a ship that is so much larger and so much more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Therefore, bringing this win win of a of a major economic impact resulting from the scale of the vessel, more jobs, more of all the activities that surround the vessel, while diminishing the footprint from an environmental viewpoint. So we are proud of it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We thank you very much for your attention tonight. Thank you very much. We're happy to answer any questions, of course.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Let me just continue on the hearing. I do have some members of the public that signed up to speak, many of whom actually were were appellants. I mean, if I read your name and you still want to say something for public comment, please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vicky. Ray. Terry Thornton. Ernie Chavez and Angel and Andrew Brady. Tommy for Bay and Janet West. So if you please line up to the podium. I'm only going to take the speakers that are lined at the podium. And then we're going to go to the motion in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members. My name is Vicky Ray.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm the vice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'President of Guest Care and Communications. Hello, everyone. Thank you. I'm the vice president of guest care and communications for Carnival Cruise Lines. And thank you for your time this evening. I just want to take a few moments to share with you a little bit about my history with Carnival.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I actually started with Carnival 38 years ago when I was 19 years old. I was a college student going to University of Miami and looking for part time work. And those of you who are my age may remember that this was the time when the Love Boat was very popular and I wanted to be the next Julie'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So working for a cruise ship on the weekend seemed like the right first step after working part time at the Port of Miami as a checking agent. Very similar job as what our Long Beach team does here in the terminal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I went into the reservations department at the Miami headquarters to be a call center agent. And over the years, I have to say that I've had the opportunity to not only do meaningful work that I think has really impacted the quality of the vacations that we deliver to our over 5 million guests a year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I've had the opportunity to grow professionally and personally to try to work with an amazing, talented group of individuals and to travel the world. I have led a contact center that has over 800 representatives and answers over 5 million calls from our customers every year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've established the first industry care team, which is a group of carnival volunteers who take care of guests that have bereavement or medical emergencies when they have to disembark their voyage. Midship Our Mid Voyage. Most recently, I led the company's effort to become the first sensory, inclusive certified cruise line.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As the company's ADR officer, it's my responsibility to make sure that we provide finding memorable vacations to guests of all abilities. So, you know, to say that it's been the best 38 years of my life is an understatement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I is a single mother and an immigrant here in the United States. Carnival has provided I've been able to provide opportunities for my family that I never thought possible. I was part of the team of leaders that first worked on bringing our first ship to Long Beach 20 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's exciting times back then and it was exciting times now as we look forward to welcoming Carnival Panorama on Sunday. I'm very impressed with the work that has been done to bring up the city to the level that it is today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm pretty proud of our commitment to the city, and we look forward to continuing to partner with you to bring not only more economic growth, but greater jobs opportunities for your community. So thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Terry.'",
        "'speaker_2': '330. No, no. Ernie Chavez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Good evening. My name is Ernie Chavez. I'm speaking in support of Carnival's Project. I have been a member of the International Longshore Warehouse Union.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Also known as ILWU for the past 25.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Plus years. I'm currently the operations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Foreman in charge of the Carnival Long Beach terminal. It's my job to oversee all the loading and unloading of Carnival cruise ships, so I have a unique perspective.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On what really goes on. I have held this position for the past 15 years. Tonight I represent my union brothers and sisters, as well as all workers that are employed in the Carnival Cruise Terminal here in the beautiful port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carnival Cruise Terminal is a vital source of jobs and local revenue. And I'd like to give you some facts explaining just how important this terminal and its future growth is, not to just those.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Working here, but the entire city of Long Beach and all the surrounding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Areas. The terminal currently provides over 15,000 ILWU jobs, union jobs per year. This equates to over 120,000 ILWU man hours per year. That doesn't include the 2600 plus security jobs.'",
        "'speaker_11': '2600 plus embarkation staff jobs. It's a total of over.'",
        "'speaker_0': '20,000 jobs per year that rely directly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On this terminal to continue to grow and maintain its presence here in Long.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Indirectly, there are countless other jobs that rely on this terminal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Carnival's terminal currently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Brings in over 820,000 passengers per year and is projected to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Increase that number to over 1.2 million passengers per year. These passengers are not only spending money on the cruise, they spend money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At local hotels, restaurants, taxis, Uber, Lyft.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And of course, our iconic Queen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mary. All the people that work in those industries directly and indirectly rely on Carnival to bring those passengers into town to support their businesses and jobs. Speaking of the Queen Mary.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Carnival is a major supporter of the Queen Mary's Improvement Project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact, Carnival's lease payments go directly to supporting those improvements. This shows that we're really talking about a much bigger picture than this for the city of Long Beach as a whole. As operations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Foreman, I can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Assure you that the carnival cares about our local environment and is leading the industry in creating a green terminal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Each new ship the carnival builds is greener and more environmentally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sound than the one before it. Every ship the carnival brings in the port line, which plugs in and stays plugged in until it sails.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Every ship every time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a gentleman spoke earlier and said that they don't they're not ready. That is incorrect.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Every ship plugs in and every time they stay plugged in the whole time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carnival also allows only clean burning propane tir for forklifts.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or electric.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Forklifts to operate on its Long Beach facility. Even the trucks and busses are not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Allowed to sit and idle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Due to our stringent.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Rules and focus on environmentally friendly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Terminal. In closing, I'd like to remind you that there are tens of thousands of workers and the entire city of Long Beach itself that relies not only on this terminal's presence, but also on its ability to stay modern and to grow, to meet the needs of a larger and greener ship.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Carnival is bringing the green to the economy, but it's also bringing the green to our environment. Through these facts, I urge you to approve this project for Carnival.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. Next speaker, please. This west. West.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Miami Carnival Corp. reached a settlement earlier this year with federal prosecutors in which the world's largest cruise line agreed to pay $20 million penalty because its ships continued to pollute the ocean despite a previous criminal conviction aimed at curbing similar conduct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Senior U.S. District Judge Patricia seitz approved the agreement after Carnival CEO Arnold Donald stood up in open court and admitted the company's responsibility for probation violations stemming from the previous environmental case. The company pleads guilty, Arnold said six times in a packed courtroom that include other senior Carnival executives, including company chairman and Miami Heat owner Micky Arison'",
        "'speaker_6': '. We acknowledge the shortcomings. I am here today to formulate a plan to fix them, Arnold added. The company also admitted falsifying compliance documents and other administrative violations, such as having cleanup teams visit the ships just before scheduled inspections.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The company also admitted falsifying. Also repeat cites at an earlier hearing threaten to bar carnival from docking at US ports because of the violations and said she might hold the executives individually liable for the probation. Three people who claim they were victims of Carnival's environmental violations attended the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Their attorney? No. Loney expressed skepticism that Carnival will keep its word this time. Time and time again, Carnival has shown its contempt of environmental laws and the rule of law, he said. Here we are again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please. Good evening. Mayor Garcia and fellow council members.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And newly elected mayors in Dallas. Congratulations. My name is Tom five. I represent IBEW Local 11 and we wholeheartedly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Support the Long Beach Long Beach cruise terminal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Redevelopment of the carnival.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we look forward to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The good jobs that that is going to create. As mentioned by the Carnival folks, they mentioned above our ship to shore power. We love to we love to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Build the infrastructure for that. We've done it in the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach. We know that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a it's a viable technology for the new ships that are coming in into the city of Long Beach and the city of San Pedro.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we look forward to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These good construction jobs and building a redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Green terminal for Long Beach cruise terminal. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It's great to hear. Oh, that's right. In. Actually, you thought you were one of the appellants.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I'm one of the appellants. But you just gave 3 minutes extra to Carnival. The first woman wasn't a Carnival employee. May I have one minute?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Actually, ma'am, because you are you are an appellant. If you sign up for public comment, anyone can send it for public comment. Miss Christianson?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I was told I could not sign up for public comment. Why can Carnival sign up for public comment when they just gave a ten minute presentation for five minute presentation?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member of the public can sign up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was told I could not sign up for public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think, ma'am, because you know, what I'm going to do is I'm going to have this question to speak and then I'll have you say a few more words. Thank you, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You could just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead and screen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And control gave our presentation. So I'm not going to speak for the language. I'm sorry. Most freedoms, wetlands task force. I am going to speak, though, for the Long Beach Area Group of Sierra Club.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can speak the sample, have you?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to explain. I'm not trying to. So I think what we have here is an issue of trust. The that's what he said for environmental impact reports. Why do we have sequel? To find out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Richardson. Just saying. Mr. Richardson, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please, please. I mean, your time is going to have to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know, but really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would use your time in these questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So why we have secure California Environmental Quality Act is simply to figure out what are the impacts on our environment. Are the people who are here, the animals, the plants, the air, the water? Right. Good or bad impacts?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's why we have it. And under what we have environmental impact reports. We get a report, we get to analyze it, really look at it. Why do we have mitigated negative declarations to keep things moving a little bit faster, to avoid having to do all those reports, to avoid having to have public comments and public hearings?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if you are really concerned as Sierra Club is, as some of these other organizations formed to protect the environment. Right, formed to protect public health like this organization for Clean Air, we're asking for an environmental impact report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're not asking for the moon. We're asking to really find out what's going on. Do we trust Carnival Cruise lawyers? No. You know, and we shouldn't have to. We shouldn't have to have them come up here and explain to you how all the appellants got it wrong.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You don't have to do that. You can ask for an environmental impact report. And we deserve it. Our port deserves it. Our city deserves it. Because this is a big and powerful company that has priors. They're convicted. They're convicted criminals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, I mean, I'm not I haven't I'm I'm all for second chances, you know. But please, let's do our own study and let's allow our our whole community, not just the port workers, bused in by Carnival Cruise.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, and I with all due respect, you know, I don't I think there's a conflict of interest there. So I just beg you from the standpoint of of your community, let us do our own environmental impact reports as a community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Much. Thank you. That concludes public comment, but I'm going to. You were one of the appellants. Please come forward. Actually, Mr. Goodhew, do you want to speak? Okay. No, no, no, no. Do you want to speak first? I'd be doing public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She was one of the appellants. Mr. Good, who are you speaking to in public comment? You speak now. You're up. Observe your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Larry, you you although I had was aware of some of the details. So some of the overall project, I certainly was shocked and amazed of the details relative to the negative impact. It seems to be ignored and people want to run right over it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I was. Good. Can't help think of what an individual would. Years ago. I had a opportunity to interface with him a number of times. Yeah. It was the mansion before. Overturned. Much of this country's thinking related to the environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With. Her two books, the first The Silent Spring. And then there's the second book. And I would suggest that you read those books of Rachel Carson before you vote. But I sat here and listen, I haven't had the time to get inside of all those issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is a disaster. The first order. This cannot be approved. Is it going now? It will be a tremendous disaster to this environmental area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He concludes. Public comment. We're going to go ahead. I know you're one of the appellants. If you want to make some closing remarks, you can you can make. So I asked the city attorney, but please brief.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Andrew Ricco from USC. Just in regard to two issues that were raised by Carnival and the gentleman from the law firm. First, he said that the MMD was revised, recirculated to show that the engine and the emissions calculations were redone, to show that the engine was tier two instead of Tier three.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I looked I tried to compare them. And the major charts that show Panorama versus Splendor, they're identical in the first MMD and the Recirculated One. If I were you on this panel of City Council people, I would not approve the Ndee without evidence that those emission calculations were redone between the MMD and the mitigated neg dac and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the recirculated neg because I don't think they were done. And there is not a word in the recirculated volume that says that they had made a mistake on the first one and that they weren't wasn't a tier three engine, it was a tier two engine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that you need to have evidence of that before you decide to vote on this tonight. Secondly, there is an email you have in your the back of your documents. In the appendices, there is an email from Piper saying that it would cost $30 million for Carnival to buy emission reduction credits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's much too expensive. It it's not feasible. So Piper gets up here and says the emission reductions are mandated. I would like to know how they're mandated. When he representing Carnival says it's not possible for Carnival to pay those emission reduction so they can't use Tier three tugboats and they can't use machinery credits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What are the mitigation measures? I think you need to understand what that is before you vote in favor of this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. With that concludes, I'm going to bring this back to Mr. Modica and then we have the motion in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I believe staff have a couple of things you want to clarify for the record.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor and council. I'd like to introduce William Walters. He's with Aspen Engineering and can speak to the air quality questions that have been raised.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. To quickly answer the Tier two versus Tier three issue. The attorney for Carnival misspoke. The Tier two Tier three issue is related to the tugboat engines that are going to be used for 20 days during the dredging operation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we did make a correction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or not a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correction. But in addition to show both Tier two and Tier three emissions for tugs, depending on which tug may be available. And that was in response to S.E. Committee comments. The emission estimate for the panorama always assumed Tier two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The issue in regards to some of the discovery period we were discussing in emails, the the ship, we were trying to do our due diligence to make sure that the ship shouldn't have been a Tier three ship based on the IMO requirements that started in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got information from Carnival. It showed that that the the hole was in fact completed prior to the date that would have required the ship to be tier three. So that was where we were trying to get that issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The difference in the calculations is 20 minutes. So it wasn't very hard for me to go back from Tier two to Tier three in my initial calculations. But what was actually presented on the record in the very first A.D. and in the restricted Mandi was always Tier two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. That's. That's it's done for the audience. Anything else, Mr. Mays?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That like to have the Port of Long Beach make a brief comment as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor and council, I'd like to introduce Matthew Arms, acting environmental director for the Port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mayor and council members. I want to make a couple clarifications. The harbor department, the Port of Long Beach, has been actively involved with our partners and development services as a responsible agency since the beginning of this project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our involvement has included both consultation on strategy, selection of baseline. Our team, our environmental team in their respective resource areas reviewed all of the technical documents, commented on it with the city, and all of our comments were addressed to our satisfaction.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In addition, we connected with the city on comments to the document, including things such as the carbon letter and we working with the City Development Services agreed that doing additional analysis to show that even if we would have used the baseline that CARB had identified that the Panorama has emissions reductions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additionally, I want to make one clarification on the sediments. Sediment disposal within Southern California are approved by the Southern California Dredge Management Team. It's a team of local and state and federal regulatory agencies and we participate the harbor department as a member of that team, but we are not an approval authority.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The people that actually approve disposal of sediments were not only these settlements, but all dredging projects within Southern California are those state and federal agencies that have expertize in that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So we have a motion in front of us. There is a motion and a second. And I'm sorry, ma'am. No, no, that's we're we're no, we are done with that, ma'am. Thank you. We have a motion any second on the floor, and that is the motion of the second is to deny the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And of course, that moves the project forward, which was the Planning Commission's recommendation. And so there's a motion for second. Please cast your votes.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Ahead. We'll jump right into the report. Jay. Here we go. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council. My name is Jay Cleary and I work for the Office of Cannabis Oversight in the city manager's office. I'm here to present the findings of a report on the fiscal and jobs impacts of reducing cannabis business license.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tax rates for manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories. Whoever is in the back, can you go forward one line? Before getting into the findings of the report, I'd like to provide a quick refresher on the cannabis industry in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Currently, the city offers licenses to five different commercial cannabis business types dispensaries which sell cannabis products directly to consumers. Cultivators which grow and harvest cannabis plants manufactures which extract essential oils from the plants and use that oil to create other types of consumer goods distributors which warehouse and transport cannabis products, and finally testing laboratories which test cannabis'",
        "'speaker_0': 'goods for mold, pesticides and other types of contaminants. On July 2nd, 2019, the City Council directed staff to prepare a fiscal and jobs impact analysis on adjusting tax rates for manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories to 1%, 2% or 3% of gross receipts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These business types are currently charged a business license tax rate of 6% of gross receipts. Pursuant to the Long Beach Municipal Code, the City Council has the authority to adjust cannabis business license tax rates by ordinance subject to the maximum and minimum rates approved by Long Beach voters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This slide provides a summary of business license tax rates currently charged to cannabis businesses, as well as the maximum and minimum rates authorized by the Long Beach Municipal Code as seen in the table. Manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories are currently charged a business license tax rate of 6% of gross receipts, with a maximum rate of 8% and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a minimum rate of 0%. The one, two and 3% rates under consideration by the City Council fall within this allowable range. Generally speaking, Long Beach cannabis tax rates remain competitive with many cities in California, including Santa Ana, Costa mesa, San Diego, San Jose and other cities identified in the Fiscal Impact Report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, there are some notable exceptions which we highlight on this slide. First, in Southern California, you have the city of Los Angeles, which charges significantly lower tax rates than Long Beach for manufacturing, distribution and laboratory testing. This is noteworthy for the fact that L.A. is our direct neighbor and widely considered to be a future hub of commercial'",
        "'speaker_0': 'cannabis activity. In the second table, you have three Northern California cities which charge lower tax rates than Long Beach for manufacturing, distribution and lab testing. These cities include Sacramento, Santa Rosa and San Francisco. Although these cities are located in Northern California, their cannabis businesses do compete directly with Long Beach operators.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For example, cannabis products may be grown and manufactured in Sacramento, tested in Santa Rosa, and distributed out of San Francisco before being transported to a Long Beach dispensary. As a result, while these cities may not be comparable from a geographical standpoint, they do operate within the same supply chain as Long Beach and therefore should be considered as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'parts of the broader cannabis tax rate discussion. This slide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Summarizes Long.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Beach General Fund. Cannabis tax revenues received in fiscal year 2018 and estimated in fiscal fiscal years 2019 and 2021. Notable trend in this table is the significant year over year growth in overall cannabis tax revenues, which nearly tripled between F, y 18 and f y 19.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cannabis tax revenues are expected to increase further in FY 20, although at a lower rate than the previous year. When looked at by business type. However, this growth is due almost exclusively to dispensaries, which account for a greater share of tax revenues than all other license types combined.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Conversely, manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories have under-performed relative to other business types in Fy18. These three business types collectively accounted for only 7% of total cannabis tax revenues in Fy19 in Fy20. They are projected to account for 5% and 11% respectively.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Given this trend, the fiscal impact of reducing tax rates for manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories is limited in the short run by the small amount of gross receipts currently being generated by these business types. The next two slides cover the estimated fiscal impacts of a cannabis tax rate reduction for manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Within these projections, the City Council asked staff to account for a potential increase in the rate of business openings. In theory, reducing tax rates may make Long Beach a more competitive destination for cannabis businesses, resulting in increased investment within the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, local tax rates are only one of many variables that businesses consider when determining where to locate. Therefore, it is unclear the extent to which businesses may respond to reduced rates by increasing investment locally. Given this uncertainty, we identified various business growth scenarios summarized on this slide, which are intended to capture the range of responses that the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'cannabis industry might have to a reduction in tax rates. The scenarios are based on the number of businesses that have already received a license, plus some fraction of businesses currently going through the application process. Looking at the table, the current projections, ROE shows the number of licensed businesses we expect to open in FY 20 under the existing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'tax rate of 6% of gross receipts. The low growth scenario assumes that an additional five businesses will receive a license to operate due to a reduction in tax rates. The medium growth scenario assumes that an additional 25 businesses will receive a license to operate following a rate reduction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And finally, the high growth scenario assumes that an additional 50 businesses will receive a license to operate following a rate reduction. Using these growth scenarios, we projected the fiscal impacts of reducing cannabis business license, tax rates for manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories to 1%, 2% and 3% of gross receipts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In nearly every scenario, the general fund projects a net revenue loss due to a tax rate reduction, specifically using the current projection scenario. We estimate a revenue loss of between 220000 to $350000, depending upon the rate selected under the various low, medium and high growth scenarios.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The impact is somewhat mitigated by the increase in business activity, but in most scenarios still results in a revenue loss in the range of 100000 to $200000. I should emphasize, however, that cannabis tax revenues are extremely volatile and subject to change with every quarter that the data is collected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For this reason, we are not able to provide fiscal impact. Projections for a tax reduction in FY 21 are beyond. Next, the city council asked staff to prepare a job study on the cannabis industry. Specifically, the City Council requested information on the types of employment opportunities available, the range of salaries offered the average number of employees per'",
        "'speaker_0': 'business and the estimated number of jobs that might be created through a reduction in cannabis tax rates. Unfortunately, very little of this data is publicly available given the emerging nature of the cannabis industry. Therefore, to gather this information, we worked with the consultants to conduct an online survey of local cannabis businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city received a total of 60 responses to the survey, with the results summarized in the Jobs Impact Report. I'm going to highlight a few of the key findings in the next couple of slides. First the average number of employees by license type.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you can see in this table, testing laboratories hire on average the greatest number of employees, with the vast majority of those employees being full time. Dispensaries hire the second most employees on average, followed by cultivators, distributors and manufacturers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bear in mind, however, that these are averages based upon survey responses. The actual number of employees will differ by business. Based upon these survey results, we estimate that there are currently 674 employees working directly in the Long Beach cannabis industry today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next, we asked cannabis businesses to estimate the salary data for senior and mid-level and entry level employees as seen in this table. Wages can vary significantly by business type. Testing laboratories pay by far the have the highest average salary across all position types.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is primarily due to the minimum educational requirements to work at a testing lab, which usually starts at bachelor's degree or higher. Next, cultivators, distributors and manufacturers offer similar salaries in the range of 35000 to $95000, depending upon the position.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Finally, dispensaries pay the lowest average salary across all position types. This is likely due to the fact that dispensary jobs are retail jobs, which may require less education and training than other types of positions. This last slide includes projections for the number of jobs that may be created due to a reduction in cannabis business license, tax rates'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories. As with the fiscal impact projections, employment projections are based upon a range of low, medium and high growth scenarios due to the uncertainty inherent in predicting the response that businesses will have to a reduction in tax rates under the current tax structure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We project that a total of 350 full time and 71 part time workers will be employed by cannabis manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories in Long Beach in fiscal year 2020. Should the City Council decide to reduce tax rates for these license types, we projected that employment opportunities will grow on the low end.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We projected that a total of 379 full time and some of the eight part time workers will be employed by manufacturers, distributors and testing laboratories in FY 20. On the high end, we projected that a total of 672 full time and 139 part time workers will be employed by these license types in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To summarize the key findings of the report. City Council has the authority to reduce cannabis business license, tax rates for manufacturing, distribution and laboratory testing to 1%, 2% or 3% of gross receipts. Reducing rates may improve the competitiveness of Long Beach relative to other California cities, including Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We project a net revenue loss of 220000 to $350000 in Fy20 as a result of reducing cannabis tax rates for these business types, we also projects possible job creation of 35 to 390 workers as a result of reducing rates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As requested by the City Council during its meeting of July 2nd. The Fiscal and Jobs Impact Analysis also provides information in the following policy areas. This includes statistics on Green Zone, real estate vacancies, comparable tax revenue and jobs data for non cannabis businesses in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Additional information on the plan review and construction phase of the application process. Background information on the cultivation square footage tax. And finally, the estimated impact of a tax rate reduction on the illicit market. Given the breadth of topics, I will not attempt to summarize the report findings in each of these areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, I do want to point out that these City Council questions were addressed within the broader fiscal and Jobs Impact Report. Next steps include staff's recommendation to receive and file the fiscal and Jobs Impact Report. In addition, we are seeking input and policy direction from the City Council on setting appropriate cannabis business license tax rates in Long'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Beach. Ultimately, this will require the City Council to decide how best to balance the potential for economic and job growth in the cannabis industry, with the projected impact on general fund tax revenues, which are used to support general city services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That concludes my presentation and I am available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We're going to go to public comment first at the request of the maker of the motion. When I call your name, please come forward. I have ten speakers and so it's down to 90 seconds. First five speakers are Larry Goodhue or Mayor SA, Sarah Evans and Robert Coda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please, in that order. First two speakers Larry Goodhew, Amir SAR, Sara Evans and Robert Koda. Please come forward and line up on the microphone in that order. Please begin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What's this city council should do? Is set the rate. So it is the highest in this country. No ifs, no and no buts, period. What would be next? You're going to legalize prostitution. All right. And underage prostitution. Give that some thought.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would hope the council I know there's some that don't have the character to recognize what a disaster this would be. If you want to say that we want to make a name for yourself and raise that rate as high as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Drive that out of the city, right out of the city, and show the people of this city and this country that you've got backbone and character and are not going to subject your children or your neighbor's children. To the downside.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'I think it's fair to say that you'll create more jobs with more businesses in the city. And if those businesses are thriving and growing, they'll need more people. If you're looking to raise tax revenue, you're going to need businesses in the city that are thriving and succeeding.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think that the last two years have shown us in black and white what the current tax revenue is doing. If you're concerned about the safety of the residents and you want to put out the black market, making licensed businesses more competitive will help do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm not sure where the downside is, but what I can tell you firsthand is the current tax revenue is absolutely killing us. It's put most businesses out of business and the rest of us that are hanging on are hanging on by a thread and will not be here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if you guys don't choose 1%, those of us that are around will go somewhere else. Right.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'It is of the utmost importance to lower the tax and low wage to 1%. For me and many in this room, this emerging industry is a career choice. It's our passion. Our livelihoods depend on this. And with the current high tax situation, there is no possibility of creating a proper workforce or growing our business.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'The local level. Given the absence of the FDA in this matter and providing a local tax revenue to offset any increased regulatory burden on the city with regards to taxes, it must be said that this industry has consistently warned about the high tax threshold in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Specifically, we were concerned regarding the customer choice to participate in the licensed retail market and be preserving a competitive advantage for all non-retail businesses in the state. As it stands today, business in the city and businesses in the city are suffering on both points.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'An immediate modernization is necessary. Cities such as Oakland, Berkeley, West Hollywood and Palm Springs will drastically lower their tax rates to match the falling price per pound of wholesale legal cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With regard to the specific regulatory.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Burden, I actually want to praise a city in the bureaucracy for their service to keep these projects chugging along, despite the constant changing regulations at the state level. Our is also clear that we need additional resources in order to complete necessary inspections.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Again, thank you. Count the Council members for your willingness to continue sharpening this policy in place. Seek out more ways to improve it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have a good night. Thank you very much, Dad.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dear City Council, my name is Herb Hadad. I am the CEO of Greenpoint Holdings. We are a cannabis manufacturer and distributor located in District nine. I would like to thank the City Council for being proactive in reviewing the burdensome tax code placed on our businesses by local and state regulations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm here to request the city lower the cannabis supply chain tax to under 1%. California's regulated market is spiraling down towards a collapse from taxes on businesses and consumers, widening the price gap between the illicit and regulated products, which will further drive consumers to the illicit market at a time when the illicit products are putting people's lives'",
        "'speaker_0': 'at risk to the operators in the industry. It's obvious overregulation, high taxes, limited retail touchpoints, lack of enforcement, no access to safe banking are suffocating the industry. And the recent wave of cannabis industry layoffs should be a wake up call to everyone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The illicit market does not pay business taxes. They don't care about building codes, obtaining licenses, ensuring consumers are over 21 follow product safety regulations. They do not ensure fair wages or work environments, and they do not participate in community or social equity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unfortunately, local cannabis is taxed at every step in the supply chain. We don't even have a cost of goods deduction allowed in the city. Even the state allows a cost of good deduction and they don't tax the supply chain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They only tax cultivators, industry and retailers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. And our last one, we have four final speakers in this order. If I can, please have you line up Stephen Contreras, Elliott Lewis, Ed Wilson and Greg Levine, if you guys to please line up in that order.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Steven Contreras. Elliott Lewis. Ed Wilson. Greg Levine. Mr. Contreras.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, City Council. Welcome. Mary's in the house. My name is Steven Contreras. I've worked in the cannabis industry and at dispensaries for the past two years. I am here tonight to ask for your help. I know that we all want to make sure that we do everything we can to make sure that the cannabis industry succeeds'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the city of Long Beach. You are concerned with maximizing the revenue for the city and the taxpayers, and I understand that. But I see things differently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To me, this cannabis industry is a career path.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I rely on this industry to support my family and my future. My employer provides union wages.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Affordable health care and job protection. If the city does not lower the cannabis tax rate, it will make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It impossible to compete with the illicit market, which does not provide any of those things. But I also see.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This industry as an opportunity to develop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My own skills. I would like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There to be a pathway to better jobs in the cultivation and manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sectors. Those jobs are those jobs are paying better, but they are very they're in very short supply because companies aren't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Investing in the high tax rate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When new jobs aren't available, opportunities stagnate. I'm asking you to lower the tax rate to 1%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Please do your part to allow this new industry to reach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Its full potentials and support workers like me who see this as a career. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Louis.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, City Council. Thanks for having this issue and allow me the opportunity to speak. I've been fortunate enough to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Be involved in six retail dispensaries in the city of Long Beach. We have five open. We're working on the sixth one. This is about 80 jobs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or so that we provided, maybe a little bit more. We have open permits that are approved in the manufacturing and distribution. We're just sitting on those products. We're not able to get around those projects.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're not able to get anybody to invest. All the cities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In Southern California, with one exception, have brought their tax rate down substantially. And we have fortunate enough to have opportunities in all.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These different municipalities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're waiting for Long Beach to do the right thing, bring it down to 1%. I want to emphasize that 1%. I think that you would see an explosion of growth. I know everybody's focused on the fiscal impact I have as far as the taxes, and I think it's a very hard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Analysis to do. But I want to make two points.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Number one, it's a safety issue. There's been absolutely zero legal cannabis long illnesses for manufacturing zero. And right now, with the taxes are issues, we can't compete with the illicit market. It's a safety issue. Nationally, people are going to go to buy the cheaper product.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They go to buy the cheaper product.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, you know, it's a health risk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other issue is jobs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think if you if you did bring this to down to 1%, again, I emphasize the 1%. You'd see a big job growth as well as those being all union jobs. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Mr. Wilson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening. Mayor Garcia. Vice Mayor Andrews. Councilmembers. Congratulations. Councilmembers in the House. City Manager. Acting City Manager and staff. My name is Ed Wilson. I'm a current councilmember and five times former mayor of the city of Signal Hill.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I've had the privilege to serve continuously for the past 23 years on the city council. In all those years. This is only my second time coming here to address the Long Beach City Council at a council meeting. Through.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I appreciate it and thank you. Normally we have our council meeting on the same night. So I am currently also the Comptroller of One on LLC, an indoor cultivator in Long Beach. I'm in the master's program for urban planning at USC.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I've attempted invite all you to come and have a tour of the facility. And I want to thank everyone that had the opportunity to adjust their hectic schedule and come there. And for those that haven't had an opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The invitation is still open. Beaumont has 22,000 square feet under canopy. Make it into one of the largest, if not the largest cultivator in the city. On it invested over 28 million before having one harvest. Hugely notable, Wal-Mart is the largest employer of the Long Beach social equity program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have over 125 employees. Of the $293,219.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To discuss with you if we can just the time is up, but I want to let you wrap up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we can quickly do so in the 220 19 of the 293,000 in cultivation tax, we paid 264,000 of that. Okay. So I will be brief and I'll get to the bottom line.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going to give you a little bit more time. But we actually have to follow our council rules. And I know you do the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That we train or we try to get you allow the public to speak, especially on something that's extremely important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it comes more readily. I'm going to let you just finish your last statement and then I've got to move on to the next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So in your report, the assumptions are critical. It uses the misnomer stating that you will lose revenue if you lower taxes because the assumption in that is that you already have those taxes. You don't. This is an emergent industry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You have measure email, which is a extremely powerful tool.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. I've got I've got to follow the council. I'm sorry about that. Thank you very much. And so going to the last speaker. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Hi, my name is Gregory Larkin. I want to say hello to the council. Thank you. And the city staff. And congratulations to Councilwoman Landers. I'm a CEO of Chronic Pain Relief Center on the West Side in the First District primary.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'm also on the board of directors for the Long Beach Collective Association and really want to thank you guys all for the time that you've put into all these reports and all the conversations we had. I currently employ 30 people and that's only on the retail.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm a vertically integrated business and the tax restrictions are really burdensome too, to grow that number more. One thing that I do want to just add on that I know Mr. Wilson was trying to for me when he was saying is that I'm not I'm not an economist or actually not good at math, but I know that'",
        "'speaker_11': '1% of something is much more than 6% of nothing in a lot of these businesses are having trouble getting off the ground. So I would please, just like to give you considerations on getting it to one, we can at least be competitive with our neighboring cities like Los Angeles, which is that 1% for distribution.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That would be great. And I would leave it to you guys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you for that very crucial fact. That concludes that concludes public comment. And we have a motion and a second, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thanks, everybody who came out and spoke on this. And thanks to the staff for putting together a very, very interesting report that gives us a lot of good the numbers and good sort of things to weigh as we think about the balance that you talked about in your presentation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So a little bit of background. So this, you know, we took this issue up and are at our committee, the Economic Development and Finance Committee, to pose a question. And the question was, if we brought the taxes in line with other municipalities, similar municipalities, can we spur investment?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was the question. It went from, you know, an unanimous vote there at the committee to city council. City council added additional considerations in terms of jobs and economic impact, and it was voted unanimously at that step. Staff has gone, conducted the research, they've taken their time, done their diligence, and now here we are to give direction'",
        "'speaker_8': 'on where we should go. So all of that leads to a number of follow up considerations for myself. So, you know, one of them is is this, you know, one of them, you know, the things we got to understand and grapple with is this industry real and does it create real jobs?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a report. That codifies and talks about the numbers of those jobs. And it tells us that, you know, we potentially have 800, 800 jobs. Hard to pinpoint what they are, but based on what city staff can identify, we're talking about a universe of about 800 jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What kind of jobs are we talking about? The arranging. If you take out the dispensary, which is not in consideration here and talk about these three business types, we're talking about salaries from 34 K to 162 K. And let's get even more specific and talk about manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this report, the study we commissioned, said that 65% of the manufacturing jobs and a salary between 61,070 1000, $75,000 a year. Those are saying that those are good salaries for for this industry. And this is our own survey.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You don't want to see it for myself, right? When as these, you know, as these, you know, permits and notices go out, the public hears about them. All they see is a cannabis related business. So I wanted to go visit some of them myself as a number of people said they have facilities in my district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I took about three tours. I accepted Wilson's invitation to visit Walnut LLC, and I was completely blown away with what I witnessed there. What I saw was a factory. I saw a factory. I saw a facility. There were hundreds of people working, and they went through a very sophisticated system where I had to put on scrubs and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'get sanitized, blown off, you know, blow off all the stuff. And you go in. And I saw people working and very skilled and very skilled work cultivating cannabis in a very sophisticated way. Once you step into the cell, you look like something you see in Silicon Valley.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was really impressed by what I saw these people at work. This is this is a job. People go to work and make good money. That's what I witnessed. I visited a place in my own district, a bottling facility.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The bottling plant that. If you know, if approved and opened, walked in, took a look at it was a warehouse where there were no jobs before. And this facility, there's a state of the art assembly line for bottling there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These guys are executives from like Coca-Cola and other places that have gotten into this business with potentially up to 100 people being hired once it's, you know, fully ordered and built out and put it in perspective, 100 jobs, what does that even mean?'",
        "'speaker_8': '100 jobs in this industrial corridor, which we've been focused on for a while, this Paramount Boulevard industrial corridor in a warehouse that wasn't utilized the last time that that place made news prior to the Paramount Petroleum facility was when 100 jobs to ABC lost 100 jobs to Texas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's Toyota auto body. California, the largest Toyota body shop manufacturing. Toyota manufacturing plant on the West Coast is in North Palm Beach. It made national news when it lost 100 jobs of similar salary union living wage jobs to Texas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And here we are. A few years later, a factory has opened up with living wage manufacturing jobs. If you take away the word cannabis, we're talking about apples to apples winds here, economic witnessing, you know, the balancing. So I visited three facilities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, what I saw was investment. What I saw was jobs. What I didn't see was vacant warehouses, and what I didn't see was property values diminishing. I saw property values increasing. I saw absolutely no impact on the local neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There were no transactions taking place. These were people going to and from work. Those people go to lunch every day. Those people have to pay rent. They have impacts on local economic. That's what I saw. In addition, you know, our job is to really balance and talk about what is our cost and what is the benefit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And again, thank you, staff, for helping us narrow down what that cost would be. They've given us the range of potentially 220 to.'",
        "'speaker_2': '350, and we want to make sure we keep our company also moving. So you've got me thinking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm concluding. So what I heard was 220,000 a year to 350,000 a year, potential exposure to the general fund. And so I saw that today. It is some back of the napkin. What does that even mean? Sounds like a big number.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I put it in perspective to the general fund. Mr.. Mr.. Moat The General Fund, what did you say? Would you say the General Fund is $550 million?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's about 550. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh 550. Just back of the napkin. The low range impact is 0.000. 4% of that general fund that we manage, we budget every year. And the high impact is 0.000.0006 essentially is what the difference is. It's when you put in perspective, it's small, you know, those probably represent junk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we knock the jobs, that's over. Thank you. So probably not 800 jobs. So I'm making the motion here. I think staff needs to get directions from a motion to leave. Director Mr. Mayor, I can't conclude until I do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So my motion here, the, when I see the difference between 220 and 350 and there's very little impact in general, about 100,000 of a difference in impact, but a difference between 400, 800,800 jobs, I think $100,000 in impact to 400 additional potential jobs makes me think that we should go for that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What creates the greatest impact on jobs, which is 1%? Some emotion would be. My motion. I want to conclude from Mr. Mayor. My my motion is to set is to recommend that the tax rate be set at 1%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, guys. Let's let's keep we have an agenda. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I was happy the second this motion had it some forethought that there would be a motion to give direction to lower the rates, which I totally support. I think the staff report is very thorough and actually some of the best work that I've seen with great data and scenarios for this council to consider.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And after eight years of trying to get cannabis policy right, I think the cannabis industry still presents many unknowns as is rapidly changing. One fact that this seems to be constant is that cannabis is a revenue and jobs generator both in the private and public sectors, including here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if we're serious about creating jobs in our city, we have a responsibility to keep Long Beach competitive with the region, particularly with this industry. I think reducing the tax rates on non-retail cannabis businesses will create jobs in our community, and that's clear from the analysis provided by staff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And based on staff analysis. I believe a potential revenue loss here in the city is very nominal. But I will say this is somebody who understands the budget sits on the Budget Oversight Committee. We do have a responsibility to to look toward a future in terms of revenue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do have a question for for staff, since does this Gulfstream, do we charge them any tax are any taxes coming from from manufacturing industries other than cannabis? That's for senior manager.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We do have business licensing tax for a various number of industries, including manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And what percentage are those?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Typically, I don't have that in my head. We don't do gross receipts. That's something that most cities do, like L.A. and others do. GROSS receipts, 1%, 2%, 3%. Our business licensing structure is actually significantly lower than that from from a gross receipts perspective.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we can get you to schedule what's normally based on number of employees and a flat fee.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. With that said, I'm going to support the recommendation and second, the recommendation to 1%. However, I will say. I would like to put our Economic Development Committee to look at business licensing on other manufacturing industries throughout the city and what we are generating there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think that would help us see a bigger picture here as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I, too, am supportive of this item. I want to go through why in just a moment. First of all, I want to give a shout out to Elliot Lewis, who operates a business in my district, and he spoke earlier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I respect the will of the voters. And when this measure passed by the voters, it was very clear to me that the Long Beach voters. The majority of them want to legitimize this industry in our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as a result of that, I think me and my staff have done everything in our power to walk hand in hand with the businesses that are in my district to help ensure their success and to treat them as we would any other legitimate business in this city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I will say that Eliot mentioned one thing that's critical to me. Some of you know, my husband is a biomedical engineer. And there was a period of time where he was looking at the labs, the cannabis labs, and thinking about that as an investment opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it is incredibly, incredibly burdensome to start a lab. I've had an opportunity to visit a marijuana testing lab, and I can tell you that the regulations and the startup costs associated with running a lab and doing it right and ensuring that it has consumer protections in place is far beyond what the average resident in the city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'understands. I mean, it's an incredible undertaking and I support this this aspect of this industry because. But for it, we would not have the consumer protections in place that we do with legitimate businesses. As a prosecutor, I see every single day what happens when substances are sold without proper testing in place, and what happens when substances are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mixed together without having gone through consumer protections? It can be deadly. And we're seeing more and more of that with fentanyl being mixed into everything, even marijuana. So I believe very strongly that we need to support businesses that protect consumers with cannabis sales and who do it legally and according to state standards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So anything we can do to help those businesses succeed, I'm happy to do because they are a legitimate partner to us in the city of Long Beach. And the voters have made that so. My fear and my concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am hopeful that by reducing the taxes as I think we're going to do tonight, that it does bring in and spur investment of this industry in the city. That's my hope as it is the hope of many who are in the audience.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I fear, however, that because I know the costs and the risks associated with running a regulated business of this industry, that we may not have that investment because the amount of money required to make such an investment and start one of these businesses and sustain it is really high.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I hope that lowering the taxes incentivizes people to come here. But I am concerned, and I think we need to be realistic, that all of the slots that we have open may not be taken as a result of the reduction of the taxes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I hope that they are and we will do everything we can to help support that. But but I do raise that concern and and and behind this, as I have in the past, raised concerns about partnerships and endeavors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know sometimes people think perhaps it's too conservative or risk averse of a view, but there have been times where those concerns have come to fruition. And I just want to make sure that we're not setting future policy based on that expectation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as someone said, 1% of something is better than 6% of nothing. And I agree with that. I think the amount of revenue loss in the big scheme of things is minimal. Having said that, I, I think that while I have deep respect for Councilman Richardson, I think that referencing the amount of revenue loss to the general'",
        "'speaker_4': 'fund budget. It is a misguided argument because, yes, our budget, our general fund budget is $550 million. However, much of that money rests in our nine enterprise funds, where revenues for those funds can only be used in specific categories.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we don't really have $550 million to put into our general fund. And so I want to make sure that we're clear about that, to say we have a $550 million general fund. And this is a small portion of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That $550 million is not available for us to use as general fund. So having said that, however, 2 to $300000, I still consider minimal in the big scheme of things. But I caution our council. I caution our council to be mindful of this because the cannabis industry is an industry that we are duty bound through voter initiative'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to partner with. We have a duty to be business friendly to them and to help them. That is absolutely true. So when we have a loss of revenue in one category, we need to manage our expenditures in other categories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to note that the time's up as well. Just trying to keep the keep the rules going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with entities with whom we do not have a legally binding relationship or duty to engage in a relationship, we should be careful about spending money in those industries and focus on the partnerships that we're duty bound to maintain.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm going to give a couple of quick questions first before I go into my rationale for why I am leaning towards supporting this this evening. Did I read recently that the state of California again increased taxes on this industry?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I asked the city manager in advance to make sure that we'd have an answer on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the city state of California recently announced two changes that will take effect January 1st, 2020. The first is to the cultivation tax. They adjust that annually for the CPI, so it could be characterized as a tax increase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It could also just be characterized as a change to maintain current revenue streams with the state that's that's mandated by Proposition 64. The second change that the state made is to the method that it uses to applying the state excise tax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The excise tax is 15% for retail sales, but the state charges that earlier in the supply chain, they charge it at the point of distribution. And then they estimate what the ultimate sale price will be based on a markup.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Previously, they were using a 60% markup, but they're required per Proposition 64 to revisit that every six months. And they discovered that the markup is actually higher on average at dispensaries, that they're adjusting it from 60% to 80%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That will have an impact on effective tax rates to to retailers and consumers.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then what percentage of the industrial property in our city is currently vacant?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uh, percentage I may not have. At the time that we produced this report, we had identified the number of vacant parcels in eligible green zones. Um, and we identified 72 parcels in cannabis green zones and green zones are where cannabis businesses can locate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we, we worked with a firm to contact those property owners to determine how many were willing to rent cannabis businesses. And a total of 52, um, were. But I think we also may have as one of our attachments the percentage of vacancy and industrial areas as of the time that we first started preparing this report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for industrial areas it was around two and a half percent.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Which is very low. And I think that it's important to note a couple of things. There's risk when any one industry has greater than a certain percentage share of any type of property in your city. Because should that industry have issues you want to make sure to keep that that the impact is limited to the number of'",
        "'speaker_13': 'layoffs, the number of jobs, the number of things across the board like that. Also in the number of 72 that might be willing of the 52 I'm sorry, that might be willing of the 72 to rent. There are still many of those properties that have loans on them and some of those FDIC insured loans and certain banks'",
        "'speaker_13': 'have stated that they won't allow the landlord to rent to them. And they don't usually always know that until the point at which they start going down that path. So I agree with Councilman Price that while lowering this rate will not likely result in more investment.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'For those of you who don't know and I don't know if anyone else at the dais has I know Councilman Austin has, but I've worked in a factory. I've actually worked in a start up factory where the lease was signed.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I was one of the first employees hired to start a manufacturing facility. And there's a lot that goes into it and a lot of investment. And that goes to the point that what we're really talking about here is protecting and supporting those that are already here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There are people making decisions about where to go, but that doesn't necessarily mean that any of the remaining 52 properties would meet their needs and or a lot of other complicated decisions that investors have to make. 1%, 2%, 3%.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I would like us to. Think about a longer range strategy on how we select the percent similar to the way that the state law is established, because it's never popular to be the council that increases taxes and we're all limited with the exception of Mary, who has the most time available to her because she just joined us'",
        "'speaker_13': 'in our way out. And we don't want to set up future counsels to be in a position where they're unable to respond to the needs of the constituents. So what I would ask is on one of the slides, it looked to me like we're really talking about a $350,000 impact to the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm going to phrase the comment, I think the way Councilwoman Pryce intended to say it, we might have a huge $400,000 general fund, but the lion's share of that is on salary and employee benefits. And we don't plan to lay anyone off to reduce the tax rate.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And we want to just time's up also. Yep.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so with that, I would like someone to bring back if we're projecting to reduce this rate in this tax year, what that impact would be if it's $350,000. Someone bring back a list of cuts if that's cuts to vacant positions in the cannabis staffing model, if it's cuts to the city manager staff, the financial management staff'",
        "'speaker_13': '. But it's going to be difficult for me if you bring back cuts to our libraries.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To our parks.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much, Councilman Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I really do appreciate all the comments that have been made by my colleagues. And I think we're heading in a very positive direction here. In the five years that I've been a council member. We've been dealing with this issue every year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seems like every year we've always had some kind of controversy in regards to whether we should establishment establish in the industry itself in the city of Long Beach and where I think we're at a point now where we have to as a city concern, as a city move forward, decide if we are going to be a cannabis'",
        "'speaker_0': 'supporting city or not, because we're we're looking at a current rate of 6%. We know that that has been somewhat of a struggle for the industry to flourish. When we're looking at 1%, we know that our partners across the borders of L.A. and other cities are doing much better and and or are having a greater growth in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the industry because of their fair or more reasonable tax rates. So all that to say is that if we are not competitive ourselves, we're going to lose out. And if we lose out, we're going to lose out our revenue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to lose out that that amount of revenue that we need further on down the line, because we know that that there is a storm coming or Long Beach, if you want to call it that, where revenue is going to be very important and we're going to be looking at other means of being able to generate'",
        "'speaker_0': 'revenue so we don't take this risk. And it's a business as it is like anybody else. You know, you you open up a shop and you put that $1, first dollar, you're on the wall and you hope that that grows into multiple, multiple, multiple.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those that you'll be able to put on a wall and build your house and build your company further. So I'm going I'm supporting the 1%. It's I think in the sense of a industry that is growing, that is new, that is different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we need to take that risk to grow it. I've also toured a few of the growth manufacturing companies, not only here in Long Beach, one in my district, but the biggest in Long Beach is in my district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I've also toured other companies and manufacturers up and down the state as as they apply for their. Hurwitz to develop and flourish. So all that to say is that I'm with you guys. I hope you I wish you well.'",

I was here when they had the lot of lottery and everything that these individuals said when it actually came to the cannabis industry the first place. I remember when you guys you were here from the beginning and you were here from the and everything that the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city asked you to do, you did. And this is why it's so important to me as a council person to be able to sit here and let you individuals know I'm not excited about the 1% tax. I 1.5.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The the reason. The reason I say that I think we need a new kick start so we can get this thing on the way and start it. And so everybody can make some money. Because if we don't make money, we create crime.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The money causes jobs and jobs create. Like I said, it will stop a bullet. Let's get this thing on the way and quit playing around and let's. What is the problem? Get us started. Let's get it going. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Just wanted to. So, first of all, there are a number of good things, good conversations came out. Just wanted to refocus on a couple of things. So it sounds like there is consensus around the 1%. You know, there was one person that called out point five and think there's consensus that consensus that 1%.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Vice mayor. Councilwoman Mongo, you mentioned that. You mentioned that, you know, it seemed like 350,000 need to be made up and you didn't want to see those offset. Well, I'll talk to the public. You didn't want to.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm sorry. If we could pause for a quick moment.'",
        "'speaker_2': '1/2.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Everybody's Thanksgiving. Good.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for asking. And it was great.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's start chanting for Dino.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Having fun, Mary?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are a lot of fun. Okay. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You do. Actually, we're going to wait for 1/2. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Okay. So just quickly, Councilman Mongo, I noticed you mentioned the 350 was a part of that range. I did want to make sure we consider they said business activity would bring that number down to like 100,000.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So even if it's 100,000, I totally understand and would agree that we shouldn't offset or cut library or other services. And I think through the budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That. Certainly engage in that. I mean, it's a lot of things that I think we should do that. And then secondly, I wanted to just clarify, you know, my statement and put it in context that the general fund is to put things in context in terms of how big of a challenge we have every year to manage'",
        "'speaker_8': 'our budget. And to be clear, Mr. City Manager, what is the size of our general fund? I said 450. I asked you how much and was the number? You said.'",
        "'speaker_12': '550 million. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And does our special our special funds included in that? No, our special interpose funds.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our total budget is about $2.8 billion. 8 billion. That's divided up into a number of different segments. And the general fund of that is 500 and to be accurate, 554 million.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So two point, give me the number. The whole budget.'",
        "'speaker_12': '2.8 billion.'",
        "'speaker_8': '2.8 billion is the whole budget with enterprise funds, the general fund of which our services come from, police, fire. All our general services come from the general fund, which is 550 million. That's typically the money that we have to make adjustments to within that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, there's salaries and pensions, but all of that is subject to city council. That's our discretionary ability to balance the budget. So I wasn't incorrect in stating that our general fund is 550 billion. If I was misleading, I would say million 350,000 in comparison to 2.8 billion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That would be incorrect. But to compare it to the general fund, I think that was fair. But but without, you know, sort of focusing too much on that. I think the goal here, the idea we have consensus that the job impact, the positive benefits in comparison to the impact to our budget is very nominal and that's what'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we should really be focused on. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And council when asked.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. I'll just try to lastly put a word on this. I know there's been some considerable conversation regarding the budget. I know during the this this year's budget process, we talked a little bit about cannabis operations and revenues for the city and what it requires to administer that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that does require actual positions here in the city, in financial management and PD, various departments, analysts to help process the licensing. And so. So that number was somewhere around $4 million. If I'm correct. Is that right? Now, at.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The top of our head, that sounds about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so the the the project the revenues for F1 19 and FY 20. I'm very comfortable moving forward with this because we clearly will have enough revenues to to administer the the programs that we have. I think some of the reservations from some of my council council colleagues are looking toward the future in terms of what we'",
        "'speaker_10': 'look at, in terms of revenues and in expenditures for the council in the city. There's some tough decisions in front of us, but I think like any large business or any industry that we really want to succeed. I came out of the aircraft manufacturing industry and I know I was there in the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Nineties, early nineties, when the red teams were put together in the the city of Long Beach worked and bent over backwards to incentivize and cut taxes and put together all kinds of packages to to keep those great, great paying jobs here in our city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was a valiant effort. Unfortunately, those jobs left. I think we owe that to the workers and we owe that to the industry here as well, too, to incentivize jobs and creation of jobs. And so I agree with Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Jobs stop a bullet. Jobs create opportunities. Jobs will also generate sales tax revenues for the city as well. And so I'm happy to support this at 1%. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And finally, Councilman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So if this passes tonight, which it sounds like there's a lot of support, what is the timeline and how does this work? Is that a question for a city attorney or Mr. Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'A mayor? Members of the city council. The initiative that was passed by the voters now memorialized in the municipal code would require us to bring back an ordinance to make this change to lower the rate. So if we get that direction tonight, we'll work as expeditiously as we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can to get that back to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council as soon as possible. And then it would require another vote to pass the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Minimum of five would have to vote for it. And then, like any other ordinance, it would go into effect either at a time certain, but no sooner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Than 30 days after it's passed.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Wonderful. So we have a budget oversight committee meeting scheduled in the next 30 days. Would it be appropriate to ask for a friendly that the staff bring forward an item to the Budget Oversight Committee that impacts this fiscal year?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Where would there be the room for this opportunity and then potentially proposals in the next year's budget, this one? Perfect. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I had a one more friendly to ask as well. I think that's responsible, but I also think it would be good to direct staff to to come back and review this overall policy and impacts in 18 months as it sets forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't believe in anything being permanent. Obviously, this is a tax rate that that, you know, we're looking at to make our our local businesses competitive and to create jobs. But at the same time, we need to be able to understand the fluctuations in the market.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'd like to have that option to at least review this in 18 months.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, I think reporting we should certainly have reporting as we monitor this. So every 18 months we should get a report on how this is going in case we make positive I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'My friendly to Mr. Austin's friendly would be that it would be in the budget cycle. That's two from now. So not next August, but the one after. So it will start coinciding with our budget annually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes all the comments. We have a motion any second on the floor right now, which is the motion made by Councilmember Richardson and second by Councilmember Austin to go to 1%. Please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Now. Now we are. Thank you. I know there's a lot of motions over here, and a lot of folks are going to start exiting as people exit. I just want to remind everybody that this is an unusually long meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for those that are here, either for public comment or the regular agenda, we have not even finished the hearing portion of the agenda. There are still two more hearings. And as as the regular order moves forward, we have to do two more hearings and then we will begin general public comment and the regular agenda.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'Allison.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Spindler. Ruiz and Ms.. Spindler. Ruiz will be making the staff presentation for this item. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the Council. I'm here to present stats recommendation on the land use element and urban design element of the City of Long Beach General Plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To provide a bit of context. The Council recall that the city of Long Beach is general plan as a policy document required by state law, which establishes the goals and policies that will guide future growth and development in the city through the year 2040.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The general plan land use element for short has not been updated since 1989. The scenic route element is an optional element that was originally adopted in 1975 and has not been updated since that time. The urban design element, or UDC for short, is a new optional element introduced as a companion element to the L'ue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'While the L'ue, it deals with the use of land. Urban design element deals with the stuff and between the public realm and is intended to replace the scenic routes element with more contemporary urban design principles that will enhance quality of life in the city and the esthetics of its neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our general plan Land Use Element Update began in 2004 and the Council will recall that on March six, 2018, the City Council voted a public hearing to approve the final general plan land use element, place type and height maps and directed staff to update the program air, which is what brings us back here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Significant changes were made to the place type and height maps, culminating in the approval by council in March 2018. Those changes included reductions in place type intensity and or maximum height allowance compared to previous versions of the maps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These reductions took place at various locations throughout the city, particularly in East Long Beach, near the traffic circle, middle shore, Wrigley and North Long Beach. On the east side, a majority of place type changes went to more community commercial, which are commercial only, and move away from the mixed use place types in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the revised programing and updated plan text before you reflect those final maps you approved last year. And the plan text had to be updated in order to show the changes that were made to the maps, as well as issues raised in the environmental review process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's before you also reflects the Planning Commission's recommendation in October for the project before you today? A reminder that the EU in the EU plan goals, which are listed here on the side, generally aim for Long Beach to have a more sustainable future, to improve mobility choices, expand transit access, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'accommodate growth projections in accordance with state law. The proposed L'union Udeh accommodates the city's population and employment projections through the horizon the year 2040, while also advancing general plan goals for open space, active living, improved urban design, sustainability and overall quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The plan includes supportive policies and implement ACT implementation actions to meet those goals as well as monitoring and report back requirements built into the plan. The proposed Alawi introduces the concept of place types to replace our current approach of segregating property within the city through traditional land use designations and zoning classifications.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Place types divide the city into distinct neighborhoods, allowing for greater flexibility and mix of compatible land uses within these areas to create more complete neighborhoods and sustainable development patterns. The urban design element helps ensure that the physical aspects again have more appropriate scale and massing that improve urban fabric and public places.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The map change was approved by council last year. We're considered significant new information under the California Environmental Quality Act or sequel. As a result, we were required to recirculate the air, which was done this past year, and as part of the process, staff had to make technical changes to both plan text to align and ensure consistency with'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the MAP changes and the revised environmental analysis. Those changes are all detailed in the attachment j of your packet. Similar to the 2016 air, the revised E.R. analysis found that all impacts can be reduced to a less than significant level, with adherence to standard conditions and prescribed mitigation measures, with the exception of impacts in four areas air'",
        "'speaker_6': 'quality, global climate change, noise and transportation. Though map intensities were reduced, environmental impacts remained similar. The only new impact found to be significant and unavoidable relates to noise. The 2016 air did not find noise impacts to be significant, but given the timing and extent of future construction, related noise is unknown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The revised air finds us to be significant and unavoidable. But this is simply a more conservative analysis. Pursuant to secure all required environmental impacts have been considered and mitigation measures have been incorporated to reduce or minimize potential environmental effects to the maximum extent feasible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are various requirements related to general plan consistency. This plan is designed to work for the two elements to work together and upon adoption will be consistent not only with each other, but all other elements of the general plan and with all required state regulations as shown on the slide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A much more detailed consistency analysis is provided in attachment eight of each of your packet. The recirculated draft air was circulated for public review for an extended period of 60 days between June and August 2019, including not only all legally required notification, but significant additional notification to all previous interested parties on this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We received 17 comments on the air during the comment period. No significant changes nor new information was required in response to those comments that would have required recirculation. Leading up to the meeting tonight, we received two additional comments from the public, which were included with the city clerk and as well as a handful of inquiries and questions'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for clarification. Adoption of value in the EU sets a broad policy framework, but much needs to be done to implement this plan. Value contains 110 city wide implementation measures and various neighborhood strategies. The another 27 implementation strategy. Is updates to the zoning code will be a primary means of implementation, including development of new zones to implement the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'place types. This will be phased in geographically with deep and various types of community engagement, as we have been doing with the plan process in North Palm Beach as well as the cap. In addition to developing new zones, other updates to development standards and procedures will be made to the code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the cap is actually a mitigation measure of the QE as well. And it will help us with many of the sustainability related policies and implementation actions included in the Louis the Council recall. We're pretty far along on the cap in drafting our framework of how to create a more sustainable and resilient city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Given that 95% of our emissions come from transportation and building sectors and Long Beach land use regulations are critical to our ability to achieve our city's climate goals, such as through creation of complete communities, to allow people to drive less, create more efficient housing and buildings, and preserve open space.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that here again is the recommendation to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certify the revised program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Iir adapt the updated land use element to the general plan replacing the 1989 land use element. Adopt the new urban design element, repealing the scenic roots element and adopt a resolution for us to submit amendments to the general plan to the California Coastal Commission.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'They'll pick these line up at the podium in that order. Mr. Goodhue, your first. You're not speaking. Okay, so Ms.. Cantrell was first. Nope. Mostly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead, Mr. Europe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Well, first, I want to acknowledge the moment, because this is a huge body of work. And thousands of hours of staff time and public time were involved in that. And here we are at the point of adopting it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will say that in terms of what was learned in this, what did we learn? We learned that people care about zoning, that they want outreach, they want to be included, and that they care about the major life investment, which is their home and their neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A lot of the work that went on was focusing on the police type maps. Not everyone was satisfied with the maps as they were approved. I know District two and District six still had issues with them, but the negotiations did occur and the product is better because of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Personally, I learned some new vocabulary. I found out in this that I am a NIMBY and a NIMBY is not in my backyard. But in fact, I was just trying to protect the students at Milliken from increased density.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The things that remain, that are still a problem. Program ideas. Negative declarations. Substituting for real year. Where we identify the potential consequences and have solutions. Things that matter. The traffic and the parking. The hazmat. Thank you. State intervention is still a problem.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. The problem and the mobility element was control. Good evening. I have some questions about this. As I understand it, the transportation. Element of this is to build along transit lines both present and future. And I'm concerned that any place you put a bus line will allow you to build 5 to 10 story buildings'",
        "'speaker_6': '. I feel this destroys the neighborhood. I still remember the cracker boxes, and I think this. Relates to what we did back in the nineties with. Over building and density and crime. I also am not sure I thought that Cecil.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Area was exempt from this, but I was told today that it's been included again. Could somebody on staff. Answer the question as to whether c support is included in this l eui. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was, please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First, it's unconscionable that you're giving us 90 seconds to speak on a plan that's going to change this city forever. The transit oriented development says that it is for metro line stations, as well as existing and future bus shuttle and other mass transit routes and stations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is not reflected on the map. According to state law, the maps and the text have to be consistent. So you're this plan. This whole plan is not following state law. And those of you who vote for it are going to be violating state law.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People still talk about the cracker box fiasco. This will be ten times worse. But people don't know who the council members were who voted for it. I'm proposing a wall of shame for everybody who votes for it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, Lynnette frenzy. And if we can, please have Lee Lee for coffee. Neil Rotunda man Eichner. Coleen MacDonald, please all line up in that order, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. I have four changes that I hope you approve in Council District six. One is change the height from 3 to 2 stories at the northwest and northeast corners of spring and Pacific Avenue in the CC place type.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This request does not need a place to change, only a height map change from 3 to 2 stories. This will allow the CC zone and Wrigley to be treated the same as other zones throughout the city, especially in Council District four and five.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Number two, change the height on the east side of Pacific Avenue from 28th to Spring Street from 5 to 3 stories. This request is also not need a place to change, only a change of the height map from 5 to 3 stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This change will be consistent with the Midtown specific plan that you approved in 2016 that allows three stories in 36 feet in the corridor district. Number three, change a height from 10 to 5 stories on the north side of PCH between Lucas and Pacific Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the toddler place type, this change will also allow consistency with a midtown specific plan. This area was two stories in 2007. Five in 2015. Not ten was proposed. Please maintain the five story height in this two block area and not allow an eight story increase in ten years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In last change, the height from 7 to 5 stories on both sides of Pacific Avenue from PCH to 19th. And change the place type on the east side of Cedar AV from PCH to 19th, from top to end.'",

Tenants organized, unified came to council with their stories and their pain, and on June 11th, they took home a win to mitigate displacement for thousands of families in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A repeal of such fundamental policy that those directly affected advocated for. On the Week of Homeless Awareness. Veiled itself as a direct undermining of these stories and these families. This is why we asked for an amendment of this policy to keep the promise and commitment to the majority renters city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The amendment is simple incorporate this that the Tenant Protection Act in its entirety at SAP to keep the Long Beach hire relocation assistance amounts as it helps to mitigate the impacts for tenants. This is a common sense approach as it is completely legal feasibly under the TPPA because the amendment ordinance would be more protective than TPA due'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to its higher relocation assistance amounts. Again, when renters rise cities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your support today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And next week or please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. This is Alex Flores. I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation working out of our Long Beach office. I wanted to talk real quickly about the Tenant Protection Act and the fact that it allows to do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Most of the speakers have been talking about, which is amend the ordinance. The Tenant Protection Act is clear. It is a floor. It specifically details what a city must do in order to make a more protective ordinance. Section g1b is very clear and it's very easy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What it would require is a city to pass an ordinance with an ordinance which says that they are passing the Tenant Protection Act with no changes, not making it weaker in any way that they're adding something higher like relocation amounts, which is an example already in the Tenant Protection Act itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And three are binding finding that their ordinance is more protective because of that higher amount. So instead of repealing the relocation ordinance, what the city can do is simply pass that ordinance and make sure that these higher amounts of relocation, which have already capped a lot of tenants that have come into our office in their homes, that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'those tenants don't lose that protection. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jonathan. Jonathan Gibson and Gretchen Swanson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name is Jonathan Gibson. I'm a Long Beach resident and a Lafleur's staff attorney. I want to talk a little bit about the city's ordinance and how important it is. It gives two months of relocation assistance, whereas the TPA is a good start, only gives one month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, what does this mean for tenants? What we're seeing a lot is these no fault evictions for substantial renovations going through. And with the extra two months of relocation benefits, that means that someone can pay for their security deposit, first month's rent and moving costs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's so much easier. The TPA, which is simply a four. When someone's facing eviction, these costs mount and this is incredibly important. Just one example we had recently was on Cedar Avenue, where we had tenants who had been living there for 30 to 40 years and they were evicted, but they were able to be given a soft'",
        "'speaker_0': 'landing by having this extra relocation assistance. And this should continue. It should not be abandoned. Thank you. Thank you.'",

Before Gretchen speaks, the following folks in the lineup is Ailsa Chang here, Andrea Donato, Myra Garcia and Roberto Lopez and Jordan Wynne who is here. Ailsa Chang. Andrea Donato. Please line up. Myra Garcia and Roberto Lopez and Jordan win in that order.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good call. Good evening. Gretchen Swanson, CD2 I am in support of my colleagues who just thought about maintaining and then building on the tenant protective effort here in the city of Long Beach. I want to speak particularly about the older adult and people with disabilities, a portion of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First of all, the language is old. I was just recognized today by a board of county supervisors for the fact that I'm an expert in keeping older adults safe. So when I come here and look at something that is at best disingenuous, a security fund which they would get back, it boggles my mind that I live in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this city that is not addressing the needs. There was a whole group that just walked out of older adults that are disenfranchized from a process of protection. So we need a well defined program, not this security deposit fund, and we need someone to reflect that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We now have a council member who is an expert who has lived the life of housing needs, rental housing needs for people with disabilities. Let's reflect that. Let's use that and do something meaningful. Let's go to older adults and people with disabilities and ask them what they need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not throw a couple thousand dollars at them and hope that we get that money back. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much of the time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, honorable mayor and council members. My name is Ailsa Tang from Long Beach Forward. Now this past spring and summer, housing advocates worked in good faith with this council to pass tenant relocation assistance. And last month we worked in good faith again with this council to enact an eviction moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we thank you for that. But now we're here to repeal what we all worked so hard to pass. That's not right. Look, the staff report is crystal clear. It says, quote, Generally, the state regulation will apply to more tenants than the city regulation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the city regulation will require higher relocation payments when it does apply. Indeed, Long Beach tenant rule adopted by this council allows double the relocation than the state to pay. So the solution is to take the best of both worlds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The solution is to amend, not repeal. Amend the Long Beach Ordinance to incorporate the State Tenant Protection Act in its entirety except to keep Long Beach's hire relocation assistance amounts. This is the cleanest and most effective way to comply with both state law and this council's intent to provide two months of relocation assistance to Long Beach tenants'",
        "'speaker_6': ', especially those who face no fault evictions due to rehab of their unit. Those families we just protected under the eviction moratorium. Council members. A vote to amend is a vote to protect. A vote to repeal. As a vote to abandon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do the right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thing. Thank you very much. I decision not to please next speaker. I'm going to ask the rest of the folks who are here to line up. I know. I see Jordan went into the back after Jordan to be Marlene Alvarado.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it is Malik Watson, Ivan Garcia and Andrew Montano. And that's the the final closing of the speaker's list is tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members. My name is Andrew L.A. and I'm the associate director of the Long Beach Interfaith Community Organization. And I'm here with the same.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Message to all my friends that have spoken. I will just like to encourage you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To step up on the leadership, on renters rights. That's an area looking to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An assistant was the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First to step up. That Long Beach took really long time to protect tenants in in Los Angeles County. We are already talking about the right to counsel there at 3% in rent control cap.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if you like the Long Beach, we are still.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Trying to defend the little.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That we have. So I highly encourage you to amend what we have to, as they have said, to keep the rates of the relocation assistant and to comply with the state law. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much, Myra Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need an.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Here, but yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was an interpreter here for the swearing in ceremony. They did not stay for the entirety of the council meeting. We didn't receive a request in the office for a public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what do you want to say? But it comes in the months ahead. Okay, look, we'll do that a minute. Madam Clerk. We can just try to get a solution to that. Thank you. Very little.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello, many. Hello. I'm Mayor and City Councilman Lopez, project director at Libre, and I am here to speak against the repealing of ten and below. I think a lot of the colleagues have said, you know, that this was a huge victory for tenants, especially for tenants who are already being displaced.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And some of the tenants that you helped protect the last like two weeks ago. And at the end, they they'll be affected once again starting January 1st as they will receive the same notices that they received due to substantial rehab.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to address two points. One is a personal story. So, as you know, I recently moved from District seven to District two. I recently relocated, and I've been saving up for a while to actually do that. I wanted to focus in on the costs of moving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I moved into a two bedroom apartment and just to move in.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It cost about $4,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if I were doing that, you know, in one fell swoop, if I was getting evicted, that would be much more difficult than what I actually had to do, which was save up for about a whole year to actually be able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm thinking of the families and people on fixed incomes, people who are working paycheck to paycheck, who are unable to pay for a new place to move, even with.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The time that they have in the lower state amount. So this is one of the important reasons that I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should consider keeping our local element. The other thing that I want to say is this isn't the only time that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're going to have to talk about how we enforce TPA and how our.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City relates to it and the way in which our policies work around that. We're going to have to figure out enforcement mechanisms.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I think it's much smarter to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amend rather than repeal. Don't do this haphazardly. Take some time to think about it. Don't throw it in right now and repeal it with. I like the chainsaw metaphor. We need to use a scalpel for housing policy. Thanks so much very much.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'That effect that we want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Avoid. Like as many others have said already, we all as a community have worked together to provide protections for these renters. That way, they don't have to save up so much money in so little time that they end up living on the street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with that, I simply say that we should amend it. And amend it and look more deeply into it and make sure that we don't just repeal and therefore strip the protections away from these people in one fell swoop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in this, like as someone else has said already, this is actually consistent with the TPA that was passed earlier this year. Therefore, in short, I simply say amend, do not repeal. And that's all for me. Thank you.'",

One of the small feelings of relief came when they realized they had access to an equitable amount of relocation assistance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you repeal, you are harming those children who were in the arms of their mothers a few weeks ago. Where I'm standing right now, these tenants under our local law are eligible for 3000 to $325.

        "'speaker_3': 'But we do want is for it to be amended so we can keep our amounts dictated by the formula of the housing authority. This is very simple. What we want is to keep our local amounts so that tenants who are struggling can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can still be protected by the strength of 1482 and our higher amounts. Thank you so much for your time. Again, we want a local policy with the with the protection of the 1482 and the same amount, the Limited Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'MODICA Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So the reason that we're here tonight is to really talk about the tenant relocation ordinance, to give you a little bit of a history, and then the staff recommendation on to why we do believe that repeal of the city's local ordinances is in our best interest, and also to create a new program'",
        "'speaker_12': 'where we really are talking about providing additional assistance to senior and disabled. So on June 11th, 2019, the City Council adopted the Tenant Relocation Ordinance, and that really requires a rental property owner with four or more units to pay relocation assistance between 20 $700 and 4500.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If you recall, there was a lot of community discussion that went into that. There were a lot of things that were either included or excluded, depending on all the public input that we heard. Essentially what it boils down to is if you receive a notice of rent increase of 10% or more in any 12 consecutive month, you'",
        "'speaker_12': 'would be eligible if you received a notice to vacate due to the landlords rehabilitation of the unit, you'd be eligible. And if you were in good standing and received a notice of non-renewal or notice to vacate, it's important to notice.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Note that this is a tenant relocation assistance program but does not restrict rent increases and did not require just cause for termination. And so what happened after we passed ours, we spent a good deal of time really crafting something that worked for for our community, as we have seen in the past.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'When local cities take the lead on these big, big issues, the state often then comes afterwards and and kind of on the heels of a progressive city says, we're going to do something that will be applied statewide. We've seen that happen with polystyrene.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We've seen or I'm sorry, with plastic bags, for example. We've seen it happen with minimum wage and that happened here as well. And so the state basically took effect, a bill that's going to take effect January one, 2020, and has two major provisions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Essentially, it prohibits annual rent increases of 5% or more. Plus the change in CPI or 10%, whichever, is lower. And then it also requires that landlords and they only terminate tenancies if they have just cause, which is significantly different than our local ordinance and provides additional renter protections.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It includes at fault just cause is the tenant violation of a lease or a no fault just cause where the owner can terminate under a certain requirements. And so the state regulation also includes rent control and just cause provisions, which is significantly more protections for tenants than what the city ordinance had been crafted since it was a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'different framework. And so the dilemma is that if nothing changes, we're going to have two sets of laws on the books. One is the state law that applies statewide. And then there would be a city law that would basically be superseded in most cases by state law, except for in very slim areas.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We do believe that this is going to cause a lot of confusion for both landlords and for tenants who don't know which one applies in which case. And that in general the relocation required under the state is going to apply to more tenants and actually be more money.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There are certain instances where the city's ordinance would apply and have a small a an increase, a higher payment amount. And we'll show you what we expect those numbers to be. Just so you can get a sense of the magnitude.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So to walk through the finer details, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick here, who will go through a couple of charts on how we believe the ordinances or the laws would work and, you know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Would each work. Thank you, Tom. Mayor and City Council. This chart shows how the city relocation triggers are impacted by the state regulation. The first two triggers of the city's relocation ordinance basically will be rendered inoperable by the state regulation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is, the relocation upon a rent increase of 10% or greater, or the relocation assistance when a tenant in good standing receives a notice of non-renewal or a notice to vacate. The third city trigger requires a relocation assistance upon removal or relocation of the unit, and that is effectively the only trigger that will be remaining now once'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the state regulation takes effect. The state regulation offers both rent control and just cause provision and applies to single family, duplex and triplex units. The city regulation effectively applies to apartment buildings with four units or more, but now only two units where tenancy is terminated until rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Prior to adoption of the state regulation, about 49,000 units were covered by the city regulation. Based on building permit data that staff assembled. We estimate that 6.75% of rental units in the city are being rehabilitated annually. So the number of units now covered by the city regulation is actually much lower.'",
        "'speaker_11': '6.75% of that 49,000 equates to 3311 units. But in reality, we think that the actual number of units that will be vacated is much less. The state regulation will assist more than 69,299 households. The city. The city regulation includes a requirement that landlords notify the city when entire buildings are are vacated in the first quarter of implementation'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of the city's policy. That's August through October of 2019. It was reported to us that a total of 45 units were vacated. That is a small sample, but it's the only sample we have. That is true telling of the units that are being vacated in the market.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if you take that 45 unit number and extrapolated over the full year, that would result in 180 units that would likely be vacated due to rehabilitation. That's about 5.5% of the 3311 units. I'll turn it back over to Tom.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Patrick. So while we are recommending, given those numbers and the way that the ordinances and laws interact, that we are recommending that you repeal it, but we also are making a recommendation that you enhance one particular area that we've really seen through the community conversations as being the biggest area of need.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is an area we would go beyond what the state requires and have a program in Long Beach set up for our seniors and disabled residents who can be, you know, have needs beyond what we believe the state is going to provide.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so what we're requesting is authority to create a senior and disabled security deposit assistance program for qualified lower income households. We are still working on this program. This you would be giving us direction to create it and come back to you with the final funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We expect this to be non general fund but have about $250,000 combined out of federal home dollars, as are housing dollars and the state homeless prevention assistance and housing funds that we will be getting later in 2020. And so we imagine that this fund would be providing assistance to our most vulnerable populations and go beyond the state'",
        "'speaker_12': 'protections. The exact amount of subsidy and how that would work and where they would come. Those are all things that we're continuing to work on and we would give you a report back. But it was pretty clear the council really wanted to do this in the in the first part, but we didn't really have a mechanism to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'do it. So this is we've been putting our heads together to get to the goal of what you had said was one of your highest priorities in this. And so the next thing we're asking is the next steps.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are requesting that you tell the city attorney to prepare an urgency ordinance to repeal this code so that it can line up with the implementation date of the state law, which goes into effect January one. So we would repeal as of December 31st, you would direct the city manager to create that fund, that $250,000 fund, identify'",
        "'speaker_12': 'the funding sources and get that created and underway and report back to you that you would work with the city attorney to prepare the urgency ordinance and bring that back and identify and fund the program that we've talked about.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So with that, we are available to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So, first of all, thank you to the public for coming out and speaking on this issue. It's been a we've been talking about this issue for a long time, and many of you iterated that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I want to thank staff for really following and being a part of this conversation and picking up where the council wants to go. The conversation here was not about not about removing protections. When we started this conversation, the city manager mentioned this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we started the conversation, there were no state protections. And as the state developed their protections, there was a, you know, a lot of disarray in the market and in fact, a lot of people. And there was significant interest in having a very clear policy and rules of the road on January 1st of January 2nd, and a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'very clear policy, the state policy, we did a moratorium to make sure people are protected until that kicks in. And then we're coming in today and the city staff is presented a repeal to go to the state policy in the areas where city staff heard from counsel, from the public that it needs to be enhanced.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Seniors and disabled individuals, those you know, we've created a way to enhance one policy with enhance the policy with a local fund. It's not burdened by the public, not administered by the public and by the private sector, but administered publicly now in many ways.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think I think staff are putting forward the table in many ways. In most ways, the state regulation is superior to our local law. More people are covered under the state law. Our policy does not have a hard just cause backstop.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The state has a just cause backstop. That means that it protects more people than what our original Long Beach policy did. It also has a lower threshold on the rent cap. Ours wasn't a rent cap. It was 10%.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it wasn't a cap. If you pay higher than that, you have to pay reload. There is a cap in the state of 5% and it's a period in many ways for renters and what we have here locally.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the narrative of this is a take away. It is not. Now, the public has done a really good job in educating us on some some, you know, areas where, you know, we might need to do more work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The rules of the road here are about clarity. So the recommendation is to is to repeal. Now, as a part of the second part, where it says create a senior disabled household security deposit program. That's where the enhancement is and that's where the really the opportunity is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So on, you know, in the staff report, the line just below table, it says, as can be seen above, the city wrote The city regulation in the higher reload amount will only apply when it is asked to vacate due to rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a narrow there's a universe and we did a little work. It's not really a big group of people. It's a small group of people that we that we know that would receive essentially one month of rent in the new law instead of two months.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And that's not what the intention was here. Right. So so I must recommendation. I'm going to ask Rich and I had a conversation when we looked at and we found these are the very people who brought this issue forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The idea wasn't to cut you out the ideas we know we want to expand the protections to everybody and be under one law that a conversation the mayor had a conversation with rich about is it a way to make sure that what that difference is and that very narrow universe we're talking about can this find can actually'",
        "'speaker_8': 'can we bring back options, bring back a solution for this fund to help people under that very narrow scenario? We still have one policy. The rules of the road are the same, but we add an additional enhancement. Can we bring back options for that rich.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mayor and council members? We certainly can. And I, in turn, have had a conversation with staff to ensure that that is something that we can do. So basically the direction, as I understand it, Council Member Richardson is in addition to an enhanced program for the elderly and the disabled.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As staff recommended. Staff should also look into the addition of a city funded, enhanced either relocation payment or security deposit assistance for people that received re low under the state program because they received notice of termination of tenancy due to rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We would effectively be trying to address through a city administered program and I'm sorry I'm going on long, but I want to be clear so everyone knows exactly what we're talking about. We would effectively be trying to address through a city administered program the exact people that would otherwise be getting a smaller relocation payment due to this'",
        "'speaker_11': 'repeal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In our initial sort of review of where the gap is and where the staff report is really a very narrow group. And so if we can make sure that that group moving forward has access to that fund, so they essentially receive the same amount, whether it's in the form of down payment assistance or not down payment, excuse'",
        "'speaker_8': 'me, running issue in the form of security deposit assistance or in the form of a reload. We want them to be able to have the same amount and we want that to be a part of the fund, not something that we pass on to the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Exactly. That's something I think we can do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me let me clarify one thing to just just to be sure. I think what's important here and I want to I want to just echo something that that Councilman Richardson said is the state policy in in 99% of the time is going much further than what we obviously adopted as a as a city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what there is a and in fact, I know that some folks had mentioned that the state re low amount is less than the city amount. That only is the case in a very, very narrow piece of that whole pie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, dramatically more people will get the higher reload payment that the state has than the than the city currently allows for. And so I think what Councilman Richardson is describing is there is a very small piece of the pie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It could be, you know, and obviously, depending looking at the numbers, it could change year to year. But it's always going to be a very small group of folks that in the current system of repeal would receive a different tenant reload benefit when in fact a vast majority of folks would almost all the time receive much more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the tenant reload. I just want to clarify that we think that is correct and. And so I think what what Councilman Richardson is describing is that it could be and you and I have discussed this number. This number could be as low as ten folks a year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It could be one building, but it happens in a certain year, could be 40 units a year. It's really dependent. It could be higher than that depending on what the building size is. But it's really on this issue of what do what does rehab on the tenancy issue and how that's affected by the higher we low amount'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Is that correct, Mr. Modica?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. So that's our understanding as well. I think that was well put that we really don't expect that portion of the city's law to to come into effect that often. We can certainly look at the request to modify and add those people who would be affected there into the $250,000 fund.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I do want to point out that the way that we have identified some the resources for this, it can't be used for tenant reload. It is done for housing assistance for qualified households. So we would take them and put them into the as a as an area of of eligibility provided they meet with those funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Or if we find that that's not a case, we'll have to come back to you on a different approach on how to fund that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think, again, the request, as simple as just how do you address that, that small sliver of folks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We want to make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That small sort.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of come home. We don't want. I think you're right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's I think we're on the same page. There are contractors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Sorry that came up fast. You guys are still talking. So I want to I want to say to the residents that are here today that this item, when we talked about it ago, that it was never an intent to remove protections, remove dollar amounts, or to loosen protections again, for for renters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I think when these items move forward quickly, that often we it takes us all a little bit of time to make sure that we understand what we're all talking about, that we all understand what the state policy is, what it is that we have in the books on the city side.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I'm going to ask just a couple of more clarifying questions. So the mayor just recapped the fact that the state ordinance covers more people, and that is, in fact, true. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the dollar amount of reload for the majority of people. It was a comment was made from the audience that it was only one month's rent. Can you or Patrick talk through what is a very low amount for the state and what is it that we have on the books right now for the city?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I know that that Councilmember Richardson is addressing this. I just want to make sure we ask and get clear answers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilwoman Mongo, the state's policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Go for it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've never. I've never. Never. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The state's policy offers one month's rent for relocation assistance. And so that would depend on the month, the rent that the tenant is actually paying and the unit that they're living in. So we don't know exactly what that is, but we do know what average rents are in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The city's relocation schedule is $2,706 for a studio apartment $3,325 for a one bedroom. Apartment $4,185 for a two bedroom apartment and 40 $500 for a three bedroom apartment. And it caps at 40 $500.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And can the city attorney talk through for me the urgency of this item?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Certainly. So to be clear, and I think it was clear in the staff report, but if this item, if you give direction to bring this item back next week as a repeal and an urgency ordinance, it would not immediately become effective with the intention, of course, I think by everybody is to ensure tenant protections through the end'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of December 31st until 1482 comes into effect. So if you do not adopt it as an urgency ordinance, then I think you're defeating one of the purposes of repealing, which is to not have two competing relocation regimes at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If it's not an urgency ordinance because of the requirements of the city charter, the repeal wouldn't take effect until sometime in mid to late January. And so for that margin of time between January 1st and whenever it became effective in late January, it would be quite confusing for tenants and landlords.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There would be two different relocation regimes that they would have to comply with. That is, in effect, why we're requesting urgency.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One more question. The Long Beach ordinance that we had passed, we had asked for notification pieces. And I'm just wondering, are those are we intending on those staying in place or will we have to return at a later date to ensure not only notification of buildings that are being rehabbed, but also I know that staff worked for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a long time on making sure we had notification that would be provided to tenants about their rights and that we had asked landlords to provide that. Would a staff see that landing right now?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, our current ordinance still does. Still does that. But if it gets repealed, we have a lot of information on our website that could be enhanced to explain in greater detail what the state's regulation entails and includes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I believe in terms of the rights of all that, that has already happened. So we put a lot of that information out already, I believe. So that has, you know, that that's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'An ongoing process, right? I mean, you've got new people that move in. You know, we want to make sure that our landlords have that information. They're providing it to their tenants as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And lastly, AB 1482 has notice requirements as part of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It as we had additional ones that I, I know there's a reason why we're trying to keep it simple tonight. And I know there there are a lot of things and I. It's frustrating because I know that we've had lots of conversations and for me tonight was supposed to be about following the state and then making sure'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that we kept in place all the things that Long Beach said we wanted to do. And so I'm trying to understand tonight for being able to make this vote and understand what next things need to happen to make sure we don't go back on our word after all the months of work that we've done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's why I'm putting us through asking these questions. There were other notices, notifications around credit reporting around renters insurance. Those little things that I think were only really important to me. And I just wanted to know, do I need to come back with an ordinance to request some of those items?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, as I recall. Those items that you requested. I remember you doing that were not to be part of the ordinance and they're not part of the ordinance, those that was direction that the rest of the council supported to give the staff that correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the information didn't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Need to be in the ordinance, but something that we will continue to do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So those were in the information sheets that were sent out and those will continue to be available. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My last question is, when, Patrick, you were given the presentation, you talked about the steps that needed to happen, set out in G, one, B, which was pass the ordinance and possibly add a higher threshold that the city wanted to in a binding ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the recommendations that you guys have in front of us that says request the city attorney to prepare to repeal that it's got the senior disabled fun prepare emergency ordinance and then again disabled fund. Do we need to take a vote to do anything to make sure that the state policy is in fact adhered to in the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'city? Because that's what it sounded like when you gave the presentation at the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If I may, Councilman Pierce. No, I don't. I think the answer is no. The city does not need to do anything to ensure that a 1482 is effective in the city of Long Beach. I mean, it will be okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just from the staff presentation, I thought that there was an action that we had to take. No. And so what I want to make very clear for the residents constituents is that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Where.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is a policy on the books, that is just cause, which is something we couldn't get done on council. So there's more rights. There is tenant rela, although it is not the same amount that we had talked about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then there is a proposal on the floor to make sure that for that small subgroup of people that are been in rehabs have enough money to get them whole as well. And so I it's a tough vote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm going to vote yes tonight. But I want to make it clear that there are still rights and there is still relocation and that we possibly have work to do in the future. So that that is what I just wanted to ask those questions and make sure that everybody was clear, because I know a lot of us'",
        "'speaker_7': 'had conversations beforehand and there was there's no reload, there's no protections, and there are protections and we we can do more. And I think that we will do more. And so I just I want to thank all of our advocates for continuing to be brave and come out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council member members, please. Gordon, cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We're moving on now to item 22, please.'"

    "Presentation from CSULB on Small Business Survey.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'We've read item 2224.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. I'm. We're going. I'm 24. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication from Councilmember Pearce recommendation receive and file a presentation from Colby College of Business Administration on the Long Beach Small Business Monitor survey.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Pierce, did you have an opening comments?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. I want to first thank Scott very, very much for waiting until 10:00 tonight. Super appreciate it. Scott and I had a great phone conversation recently about small business protections, and they've done a lot of great work in monitoring out of Cal State, Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's a lot of work that I think we can do in the city to ensure that we're protecting and supporting our small businesses. But before we get to some of those items in future months, we thought it would be great to hear from Cal State and also hear about the future surveys that you guys are working'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on. So thank you very much, Scott. Really appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My pleasure. Thank you. It's been a long night, so I'll be very brief. I come from College of Business. I'm a professor in the Department of Marketing, and we do a survey of Long Beach small businesses. Once a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've been doing this survey since 2012, and I'm here to report on the latest results of that survey for you guys. I'm just going to get right to the results. You have the report sitting in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we found in this past year was a decline in expectations about the future, and the decline is significant. So there is some increasing concern among small business owners here in Long Beach right now. We also found that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a far fewer small business owners who feel that you're going to see a increase in their revenues over the last year. So there is growing concern about the future among the small business owners here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what we wanted to do is want to find out why and then work with the Economic Development Commission to try to figure out some solutions to these problems. So what we uncovered was a significant increase in the past year in concern about access to capital and financing and cash for business and and the ability to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'find and retain new customers. This is something new. We haven't seen this before. So we can attribute these increased feelings of concern to an overall feeling of declining expectations. And so these two areas are extremely important for small businesses, first, in terms of adequate cash flow and access to capital.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When a business doesn't have that, what they tend to do is begin to cut back on things in the business, which reduces the quality of the product or service that they're offering. And when that happens, they begin to lose customers and it turns into a spiral and the business eventually goes out of business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's very important for businesses to be able to have adequate capital in order to be able to acquire new customers and provide high quality services. The second area finding and keeping customers really has to do with the way citizens in Long Beach today are finding small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Most of them are today are using their cell phones and computers to find small businesses. And many of the businesses today in our survey, you'll see many of the business owners today feel they don't have the time, the expertize, the financial resources to do this kind of outreach and marketing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as a result, they're at a significant disadvantage to online stores and larger companies that have a better opportunity and more more resources. This is a significant problem. So if a small business today doesn't understand this issue and doesn't incorporate it into their business plans, then they're probably not going to be that successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a little bit of a shakeout going on. Some businesses that are able to utilize these kinds of services are going to be the ones that are going to be successful. And so one of the things that we try to do at the university is to try to match up our resources, our students and our faculty with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'small businesses to help them in this particular area. Because without this support, they're not going to be able to find new customers, and they're not going to be able to create relationships with customers that are needed to maintain their businesses today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's the short of it. I want to be really short because it's been a very long night. And I appreciate your time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I want to just add I just want to thank the partner college business and the survey. I've been following this survey since you launched it and I always find it. I read it every year. I appreciate the the publication you put out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's got the data on it. And I think it's really good data for the city. And so I just wanted to personally just thank you for, for that work and and for your department, but also the entire college of business in the work they do on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you. Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To City.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I want to thank you as well. I'm a fairly new small business owner. We're coming up on our one year anniversary. And I just turned over at turn to council member Pearce and said, I wish my husband was watching this right now because it's fascinating.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, so much of what you said rings true to me in a way now than it would have just even a few years ago, because we're going through it. So thank you very much. I look forward to reading the full survey myself and sharing it with my husband and business owners in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You have something else, Councilor Pearce?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just wanted to say two things. One is I want to think a staff John, I know we've been talking about how we can kind of wrap our hands around small businesses and of a retro role. We've had three businesses triple the rents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so when we talk about access to capital, I think we had the conversation around, well, what's that capital for? Is it only product? Is it rent? Is it what is that? So I really look forward to seeing the next survey and partnering with some of your students, hopefully in the future with some of our small businesses'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So thanks for staying the long night. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And with that, we don't have public comment on this item. I'm saying so, members, please go ahead and cast your votes.'"
