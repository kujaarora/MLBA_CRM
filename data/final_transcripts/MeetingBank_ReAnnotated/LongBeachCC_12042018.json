        "'speaker_2': 'Local legal defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That could be feasibly implemented. We explored the possibility of having a local foundation serve as a fiscal intermediary with the city serving as the direct program manager. We found that this option would require a significant amount of staff, time and.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Of Equity to effectively.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Manage a legal service program for removal defense. Additionally, in this model, the city would likely have to pay an administrative fee for a local foundation to manage the charitable fund.

And on September 4th, City Council adopted the Fy19 budget and approved $250,000 for the land to establish the Long Beach Justice Fund.

And finally, the third objective, in order to make this effort successful, would be to identify a method to expand the fund through matching donations'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and grants. In our research, we found that very Institute of Justice through its Safe Cities Network project meets all of the above all of these objectives. Viera has successfully worked with 12 jurisdictions in eight states across the nation to establish, manage and evaluate their legal defense fund.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The jurisdictions identified here as part of the Safe Network have contributed public funding to initiate immigrant legal defense funds, according to the community's unique needs, with the benefit of in-kind technical assistance and match funding from Viera in one program with proven results.'",

Because of these unique capabilities.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Establish performance metrics, monitor the quality of legal representation, and evaluate the success of the legal services program.

        "'speaker_10': 'While the Bar Association does have experienced immigration attorneys within its network, it does not currently have the defined program a defined program for administering a legal defense fund for detain or detain immigrants at risk of removal. However, utilizing experienced immigration attorneys from its network, the Bar Association could respond to the RFP process as an eligible legal service'",

These local organizations are funded to provide education, outreach and application assistance.'",
        "'speaker_10': '16 state funded organizations in L.A. County receive funding for removal defense, but none are located in the city of Long Beach. The city's one time investment of local funds for this purpose could address this gap and could could also help build the local capacity infrastructure needed to leverage the state funding moving forward.'",

For those the fathers, brothers and families of five year olds in actions, youth are being deported, adding fear, uncertainty, severe financial hardship, childhood trauma and childhood trauma to our community, which already disproportionately suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.'",

I know that this accomplishment did not occur overnight, and I know that there were a lot of people that work day and night to make this effort a reality.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So now we have to the next step is deciding on who will manage the fund. So this means that I fall under those who will benefit from this fund. And I believe that the Vera Institute is the most qualified sponsor to handle the Long Beach Justice Fund.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'To those who are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In this situation. The Vera Institute is the right institute to hold these funds because they have the capacity that is needed to distribute the funds and they will also match $100,000 more. The Vera Institute has the right expertize to accommodate the money to better serve those who need it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Universal representation is key because everyone should have the equal right to representation regardless if they've had history with the criminal justice system.

        "'speaker_3': 'There are a couple of themes us to me during the equity presentation. Those themes are one of highly specialized expertize needed and an experienced agency and one that is efficiency because this is an urgent matter. Given those themes, I think it is important for us to move forward with our partnership with the Vera Institute and also in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'paraphrasing their area of expertize. I'm going to quote straight from their main site. For too long, most immigrants facing the terrifying prospect of deportation from their homes, loved ones, communities and families have had no access to legal counsel and have found themselves navigating have found themselves navigating the complexities of immigration law alone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Safe Network, which has mentioned here Time Again, aims to change that imbalance and ensure due process for all immigrants. Much like a public defense model in criminal cases. The universal representation model advances the safe network, which means that everyone at risk for deportation should have access to due process under the law.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In times like this, in this political moment, it is important for us to be urgent, to move expeditiously and move forward with experts. So I urge your support in partnership with the Vera Institute, and I thank you for listening to our comments tonight.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Currently, many immigrants fight their cases alone in immigration court. On one side is an individual fighting their case, and on the other is a government trained, a highly, highly trained government attorney with the full disposal of their legal skills, legal knowledge and expertize in immigration law, which is a very complicated area of law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The glaring imbalance of legal knowledge, access to justice and due process allows the anti-immigrant Trump deportation machine to blaze forward and full steam ahead. Losing a family member or a loved one due to deportation is serious, with long term impacts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When critical members of the Long Beach community disappear due to immigration, detention or deportation, families in Long Beach are ruptured. Communities are filled with fear and trauma, and the city and the city's economy, health and safety is severely threatened.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Long Beach Justice Fund is a significant step in restoring due process and fairness to immigrants and their communities. The fund must prioritize providing legal representation for immigrants who are fighting their cases in immigration court over affirmative representation services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Affirmative representation includes applying for benefits such as DOCA naturalization or an immigration visa. And while these are very important services, many legal organizations and nonprofits already provide affirmative representation services, and they receive federal and state government funding to do so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We cannot divert valuable and limited justice when dollars to these already funded services. Instead, we ask the city to go forward and prioritize providing critical legal defense services so that the justice fund can make the greatest impact for the unserved communities and populations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Council should approve the recommendation and we ask that they move forward, that you all move forward with your institute tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Hello. My name is Ann.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Burdette and I'm Jan Ford.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And together we are co-founders of Sacred Resistance, which is a coalition of over 20 faith communities in Long Beach. And we are here to thank you tonight on behalf of that coalition for passing initially the Language Values Act Array and also for the Long Beach Justice Fund.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are thrilled that Long Beach has the opportunity to partner with the Vera Institute of Justice for fiscal sponsorship of our own justice fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have read online the comments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Of the mayors and council members of the dozen cities that have worked with Vera on the last year. And they unanimously speak to the fact that Vera's support, through its Safe Network, which stands for Safety and Fairness for everyone, has improved their cities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In the words of Councilmember Elizabeth Brown from Columbus, Ohio, she sort of summed it up When we give immigrants the resources they need to establish their legal right to live in the United States, we make our city a stronger, safer and more vibrant place to live.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, that's what Long Beach is, and I think it will continue to be with his partnership with the Vera Institute of Justice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Mayor Garcia, members of the city council. My name is Jessica Quintana. I'm the executive director of Central Asia. We have a long history of providing immigrant integration services that include citizenship and legal services for folks that are just as involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Getting ready to apply for their green card status, renewing their green card status, helping folks who are low income, limited funds, and helping them with fee waivers to ensure that they achieve citizenship. I could tell you in this day and this climate under this administration, there is no one that's safe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't care what immigrant status you have. So it's very important that, you know, we take measures to protect our immigrants here locally. And I'm so glad and very excited about this agenda item and proposing the Safe Cities Network Agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think there could be a better name for this this initiative. And I just want to thank Councilwoman Gonzalez and the rest of the council members for bringing this forward and really having this discussion and and really immigrant rights coalition for championing this initiative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's so very important in our long history of working with immigrants in this city. And, you know, we do this on an annual basis with thousands of people who come through our doors. And so this population, you know, is very much in need of support and in integration and not just immigration services, but with removal, defense'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and helping them to integrate, you know, into the communities through citizenship, workforce development, housing. So I want to ensure that when we have this discussion, it's a discussion not on just one area, but that we're focusing on the whole integration part with the immigrants that live here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we have folks that have gained their status and their citizenship, but they're still living low, low income. They're still living from paycheck to paycheck. So, you know, we've got to have, you know, a larger and bigger discussion as to how do we locally support our immigrants and how do we continue to help them through the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'pathway, through integration and higher wages and achieving the ultimate citizenship and keeping our families together and keeping them home. So thank you so much and thank you, counsel, for having this discussion and very proud of you guys tonight bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I look forward to to a great agreement among you all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good afternoon, Mayor City Council. Thank you, Lina Gonzalez, for bringing this item up. My name is Sandra L.A. and I'm with the great Lumbee Interfaith Community Organization.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My organization represents more than 15.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Congregations in Long Beach, and we are part of Pico, California State Organization and also part.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of Faith in Action National.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm here today to urge the city council members to vote in favor of the Viera Institute. My organization has been working for more than ten years on immigration issues at different levels of government.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We stand with the VRA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Institute not only because they will match the funds with an extra $100,000, but he has experience on managing deportation defense funds throughout the nation. When we learn that the Long Beach Bar Association was interested in also managing these funds, we called and asked some of the attorneys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have been working with us for years. Their feedback was that they are not part of the Long Beach Bar Association because they don't have an immigration focus group as other bar associations such.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As the L.A. one. We are here advocating for what's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Best for our community. The immigrant community has been very hurt for not by not expert immigration attorneys that have in some cases very damaging their chances of actually getting their residencies. Please do these right and vote for the contract.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With the Vera Institute. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q And our final speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Tania Sasuke and I work for the Vera Institute of Justice. I have some materials for the council members if I can share them with you at the at the end. So Vera has a long track record in this space and a lot of accomplishments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No other organization has Vera's combined capacity and and experience in providing infrastructure and support to create and manage national programs in the area of legal services providers and legal information. Vera has had since 2005 and aggregate annual budgets of 70 million and federally funded programs to provide legal representation and legal information to both adults and unaccompanied children's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and deportation proceedings, most of them detained. These national programs operate in more than 35 cities and have significantly increased the efficiency of immigrant proceedings. Through this work, Vera has constructed a nationwide network of immigrant legal service providers that serve more than 100,000 immigrants each year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Despite the high stakes, people in immigrations do not have a right of government funded counsel. They must navigate the notoriously complicated and ever changing labyrinth of immigration law by themselves against a government trained attorney. The Safe Network is a diverse group of a dozen cities and counties across the country that are dedicated to due process and a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'fair day in court. A principle that is central to America's vision of justice. Building off the success of the Safe Network on the first year and growing national momentum towards universal representation. Vera is inviting applicants to join the National Growing Movement by submitting a letter of interest.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city of Longreach has already fulfilled the first step towards membership in the network and based on various communications with representatives of the city of Long Beach. Its various understanding that Longreach Legal Defense Fund meets all the safe membership requirements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we therefore expect the application from City of Long Beach to be a competitive one. As a member of the network, Vera would provide an ongoing data driven evaluation of this program to ensure accountability of the public dollar spent as well demonstrate the efficacy of the program in addition to the catalyst of up to 100,000 from Barrow'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Our goal is to demonstrate the value of providing immigrants with legal representation using robust and evidence based models I have. These packets includes information on the request for proposal, as well as an evaluation and a fact sheet on the first year of the network.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And another fact sheet regarding the impact that immigration attorneys have in removal cases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They can you can just leave those actually with the clerk over here. Thank you very much. And I'm going to go ahead and close public comment. Thank everyone that spoke. So with that, let me turn this back to the maker of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I first want to thank everybody for being here and everyone who has worked with my office in particular. So I will thank the sanctuary, coalition language, immigrant rights, coalition language forward central chalk my girls in Action. CSU will be fuel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am 947 for their letter of Support and National Law Center and we thank everyone for being here and all of their work. This is not been something that happened overnight. As someone said, this has been a lot of years of work that everybody has been gathering and making sure that we're being very mindful and thoughtful in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this. I will just reiterate a few of the points about why the Institute is so very essential. Certainly matching funds, which you wouldn't get anywhere, but experience decades of experience in the issue of immigration, a national perspective. In fact, I work at Microsoft.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We work with them as a data partner. So being able to have that global perspective that can bring the city of Long Beach on a higher level in terms of what we're doing here, that is so above and beyond what other cities might be doing, technical assistance and training.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Training, of course, transparency overall in what we're doing, key performance indicators, evaluation and data, which I think when you're using city funding and money, it's exactly what you want. And over 90% of their funds goes towards programs and services and they post all of their financials and board information online.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So everything is completely clear and transparent parent. But overall, they have community trust, which I think is extremely important, especially with this very important issue. So I will say, I hope that my colleagues can support this today. What I will ask is a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that we have segregated within the item a percentage of of the funds dedicated towards Dhaka, asylum seeking and then another dedicated towards deportation defense. From what I'm hearing and what I've known about the community is that we have a lot of that work already being done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'd like to transfer a lot of that, well, 100% of that work towards deportation defense. And I think that's the focus of this of this fund. So I'd like to make an amendment to be able to do that 100% towards deportation defense, first and foremost.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then secondly, I have a question. I want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To make sure the second or the motion contrary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'CAP. Thank you. And then secondly, how quickly will you know this is the first step. This is the management aspect, the matching funds getting this this done. The second step is the RFP, which will include community input, which will also include the city working together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the RFP is out there. Anyone who is interested can respond to the RFP at this point. Who has immigration. Deportation. Defense? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The. Councilwoman Gonzalez, I just like to point out that the the RFP process has not yet been initiated. We were predicating that on, you know, council's decision on the agreement. But, you know, should council pass to adopt the agreement, we would immediately, immediately follow up with developing an initiating RFP process for the selection of a legal services'",
        "'speaker_10': 'provider or providers. That said, we would need to do some preliminary work with with Viera. And we also plans to work with community organizations in the process of defining the criteria for that RFP process. So there would be a little bit of work to do to initiate it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But certainly if council were to adopt the agreement, that process would start right away.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we'd start right away. Do we have an estimation on when the fund would be available for. For this work. Given if everything runs smoothly with the RFP, do we have an estimation on when that could be available?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would estimate. mid-February. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. Well, I will conclude with, you know, we've decided that we wanted to move forward with this in the budget. Now, this is the next step in really, really receiving a return on investment on these funds with matching funds and then really moving forward and starting the the process in early February.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I really think Katie and Kevin, for all of their work as well in this, I know kind of getting the community together on many occasions, getting everyone involved and hopefully on the same page is very difficult oftentimes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But you got us there. So I really appreciate it and I urge my council colleagues to support this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Count summary, Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Barry. And I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez for bringing this forward. It's it's an issue that has been at the forefront of headlines for not only locally, but across the country. And I think that adding that aspect and making sure that it's that we concentrate on deportations, I think it's a Great Amendment and I certainly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'agree with that. And I think that we should move forward with that. I also want to thank staff for their thoughtfulness and in putting this together and putting a lot of reaching out to the community and trying to get as much information as we can to ensure that whatever package we put forward, such as the one we're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'putting forward tonight, is the best that can be possibly put together. So I strongly support the the motion and with the amendment, and I would also encourage my colleagues to do the same. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, I have a couple of questions. So one of the things that was mentioned was that 90% of the funding goes to programs. What guarantees do we have or can we write into the proposal or contract that ensure that all $250,000 stays for Long Beach residents?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Jackson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilwoman Mongo, members of city council. According to the draft agreement that is proposed tonight, 100% of the funding would the $250,000 would be committed to services here in Long Beach? That would be absolutely part of the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what is the percentage of overhead?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There is no overhead. All the services that the Viera Institute plans to provide are in-kind in addition to any match that they might offer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the document they provided shows ten cities. They mentioned 12. Do we know what the other two cities are that will be in competition with.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, there are 12 jurisdictions between cities and counties participating in the network now. And so this new RFP, they have room for including at least five more jurisdictions. And so if we are successful, we will be one of the five jurisdictions that would become a part of the network and receive the Kellis grant funding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what if we are not successful? Do we have the option to return our $250,000 and perhaps award it directly to Central Shore or directly to the Bar Association? If we are not chosen as a it says in the documentation a member and say we get a partner status or an affiliate status, do we at that time'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have the option to return to council and make adjustments?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I guess if council directs us to do that tonight, certainly we could do that. You know, the membership is not contingent upon receiving the grant. However, we're you know, we understand that we're in a favorable position to receive the grant based upon the model we propose, if any event that we weren't not successful in receiving the grant'",
        "'speaker_10': '. We would still qualify to be a part of the membership so that that decision would be a council decision to to, you know, determine whether or not we should come back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it's an option.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is definitely an option.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Wonderful. And have you done some research on the rates of the attorneys that are available through the Vera Institute? As I know, the Bar Association, when they discussed some things at a previous meeting, they said they had a flat rate of 20 $500 per case.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, do we have a flat rate? Is it billable? How do we ensure that the people who need the services don't start down a process and then are cut off in some way?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Certainly the rate would be negotiated as part of the contracting process. I don't have any, you know, specific information about other agreements and about what those rates would conceivably be. I know early on in this process we were working on the Long Beach Values Act.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There was an estimate of anywhere between, I think, 2500 to $5000 per case. But to qualify that, the idea would be for for legal representation for the duration of the case. So regardless of, you know, the rate, there would be full representation to to through resolution of the case because how much time it would take.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I would be most supportive of any kind of amendments to the motion that would give the money directly to the organizations that have participated. I think that having a middle man is a challenge, and I think it loses our accountability.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One of the things that I really appreciated about the Bar Association's presentation, I mean, I was able to talk with them a few weeks ago as well, is that they would give quarterly updates on the number of people who have applied for help.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The number of people who have received help. The number of people who have been successful and how many of them are Long Beach residents and at what income base they're at. I think Central Shore has the same capacity to provide that kind of reporting, and I would be of the mind to make either a friendly amendment or'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a substitute. I would like to hear from my colleagues first, but to actually just give the full $250 to $250000 to either organization or a hybrid approach to giving them each a seed money and then let them come back in six months with whoever has helped the most people to have the rest of the funding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I really am passionate about keeping the money local and I think these two organizations have both demonstrated their success in the community, and I would be supportive of giving either of them the funding tonight. But I'm open to hearing from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brice.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So the vote tonight is is about the RFP. Is that am I correct? Mr.. Mr.. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No, the action tonight would be to authorize the city manager to execute an agreement with Vera Institute of Justice, which would then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Through that agreement, Vera would initiate the RFP.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Okay. I got it. So I. First of all, I want to thank the organizations that came out and spoke. I was very impressed with the Long Beach Bar Association's mention of the work that they're doing with Expungements.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I've always felt that we shouldn't use public funds for individual claims or legal battles, but that if we do, we should have a broader category and that expungements should be included to allow our residents to be able to become employed and get jobs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm grateful that they do offer that service. Having said that, I know we're not discussing tonight whether or not this money should be allocated for this purpose that's already been decided. I do have I would love to see some limitations on who becomes the beneficiary of this assistance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that if a person is facing deportation, there are different categories of folks who are facing deportation. And I see them every day and my day job and certainly we work very closely with those who are facing criminal penalties and are maybe having their DOCA application in.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the penalty that they're facing or the crime that they're facing doesn't really tell the story of who they are. And so there's an opportunity to really work with them on the charges so that they don't face deportation based on the charges.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But once an individual is convicted of a certain category of crimes and their deportation is initiated based on that conviction, I don't think we should be using tax dollars to help defend deportations for individuals who have been convicted of a crime that is determined to be a deportable offense, which not all crimes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Are there specific categories of crimes that are such that a person would get deported? So I would like to ask the makers of this motion if we could include that as a condition that in terms of where this money is spent, if an individual is facing deportation because they were convicted of a qualifying criminal offense, which again'",
        "'speaker_11': 'is very limited and outlined in the federal regulations, that the the taxpayer dollars would not be used to assist that individual.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, this is a universal fund. So can we walk through that, what the Universal Fund means? Because from my understanding, we are able to use that on these on people that may have had criminal backgrounds from some time ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So perhaps there's a discussion with what Councilman Price is saying. But if we can first talk about the Universal Fund aspect and then we can go back to her.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, let's see. What I want to do is I know that. I know Councilman Price has the floor. So did you want to finish? We want to get that question answered first or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sure, I'm happy to. And I can be a little bit clearer. Maybe I wasn't clear. People who are facing deportation specifically as a qualifying criminal conviction. So their deportation has been initiated because they were convicted of a qualifying criminal offense.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay? Sure. Murder, robbery. Assault with a weapon. Gang related shootings. Crimes of moral turpitude. There's a whole list and category of them in terms of what's considered a significant misdemeanor and what's considered a qualifying felony.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we want to, Mr. Jackson, do you want to go to that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilwoman Price and Gosar and members of the council first elected to state simply that universal representation is basically the. The eligibility criterion is income. That said, we do have the Vera Institute of Justice here in the audience tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think it would be more appropriate for them to help us get a better understanding about universal representation, if they could. Ms.. Tanya Salazar. I think it would be helpful for them to do that for a state.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To address your question. Yes, it would be a universal representation model, which means that there would be no looking at the merits of the case. So in addition, there would be no criminal carve outs. So that does include people that would be deportable because of crimes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of course, that also does mean that those are legal permanent residents, veterans. That's the reason why they get into deportation proceedings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in that that would.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Include of aggravated felonies or any any type of crime, it would be a merits blind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Approach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So just just to add, I understand what you just said, but just to clarify it from my end city. Public moneys would be used to help individuals who are convicted of qualifying criminal offenses and as a result, deportation proceedings have started.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We would be using public money to keep those individuals in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It would include everyone so that, as it was mentioned, it would only be based on income requirements. But I will point and I can provide those studies that in our other programs, a number what usually happens is that they are able to do what's called post-conviction relief and go reopen the case.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If there was a constitutional violation or if someone pled guilty to a crime where they didn't understand the consequences or there was a legal defense. So they're usually the that the defense that's available for people in those situations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are actually.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Proving that the conviction should have never happened.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So this money that the city would be giving to Vera would also be used to appeal the convictions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not appeal, but post-conviction relief.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Even though the post-conviction release has nothing to do with deportation or immigration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As you pointed, it actually is directly involved. That's the reason why they are in remote proceedings. So the underlying criminal conviction is actually the basis for the removal proceedings. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So let's just take a hypothetical here. We have an individual who's convicted of murder, okay? They're there. They're convicted. They've convicted by a jury, let's say. And as a result of that, deportation proceedings are started. You get money from the city of Long Beach to help them with their deportation, even though defending their deportation, even though they'",
        "'speaker_11': 'were convicted by a jury of a qualifying criminal offense.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First, let me clarify that although Vera would be receiving the funds, we would.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Providing the attorneys. We would partner with the City of Long Beach to do an RFP to select whatever organizations. The organizations I spoke today would be perfectly fine that want to provide the representation. And Vera would not actually keep any any any money would provide in-kind services free of charge.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I appreciate that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Secondly, yes, but as probably I mean, speaking of hypotheticals, a person that was convicted by a jury trial for murder probably is not going to be able to get their case reopened because it was a jury trial, wasn't a plea, and therefore is probably an aggregate of felony or it is an aggravated felony and they wouldn't have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'any legal relief. So the representation would be a consultation and explanation that they don't have any relief and being in court with them as they accept the removal order.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What do you mean they don't have aggregate felony felony?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Aggravated felony is what would a charge of murder, a conviction of murder would be under immigration law, either Immigration and Nationality Act, and that would disqualify them from the majority of forms of legal defenses for removal proceedings. So as an attorney, you would look at the murder conviction, realize that it went to trial, that it probably everything'",
        "'speaker_5': 'was an up and up and that there's nothing you can do to look behind that case. And it would just be an explanation of your client that there's nothing that they can do, that they should probably accept the removal defense at their next hearing instead of asking for time and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So maybe that was a bad hypothetical. Let's say it's an aggravated. But first of all, let me just say I disagree with you. I think there's a lot of post-conviction work that goes on with jury results. But I just because a jury has come back with a verdict doesn't necessarily mean there's no post-conviction relief to be'",
        "'speaker_11': 'had. So I just want to know, would the city dollars be used for post-conviction criminal relief?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If it's. I'd like to get Kent Councilwoman Price. Can I. Can I just like to make a clarification really, really quick before Tanya responds, and then she can continue if necessary. But I just I just want to point out, you know, the the basis the basis of the representation is to provide access to due process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There is evidence that in some. Some cases that people people are, you know, inappropriately charged or incorrectly charged. But the whole point of the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm sorry, there's some evidence that people are in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With criminal offenses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, I understand. But how does.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't want to mix the two. I just I just want to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Make I just want to understand what we're using public money to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So and I would I would affirmatively say that the basis of it is is to provide access to to due process and fair legal representation. Thank you. And that's it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For criminal justice or for immigration?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'For for immigration.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So for immigration. So the purpose of this fund is to help people due for have due process for immigration. So how is it that this fund is going to be used for post-conviction relief of a criminal case?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And are we augmenting the budget of the public defender by allowing another layer of post-conviction review through city dollars?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So let me give you a hypothetical, Mr. Jackson. Since since since you have taken over the answering of these questions, let's say someone has an aggravated. Misdemeanor. Let's take sexual battery. Okay, whatever I pick. Is there a aggravated misdemeanor that you'd like us to use is the hypothetical.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Anyone. Okay, let's. Is sexual battery okay? Let's. Let's use sexual battery. Let's say they plead guilty to the aggravated misdemeanor. Their deportation proceedings are initiated as a result of their guilty plea. How would City of Long Beach moneys be used for that individual?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But for their conviction, they would not be being deported.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, excuse me if I could. As Tanya said, if somebody is facing that situation, their case is going to be handled by the criminal court.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And when they enter deportation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Proceedings, the lawyer who's providing those immigration services will do a consultation, determined that there's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mechanism by which this person can be protected from removal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and provide.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Them with what resources they have available.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But at that point, their hands.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Would be fairly limited in the services they could provide just based on federal immigration.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Law. Okay. So what the representative from Vera said is that they would help with post-conviction proceedings. Is that accurate or is that not accurate? I just want to know what city dollars are used for. And frankly, I'm concerned that someone from the city manager's office in the conversation regarding where money for immigration purposes is going to be'",
        "'speaker_11': 'used, is talking about people being improperly charged in the criminal justice system. I don't know what that has to do with this immigration fund. We're just talking about these dollars.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think I think the conversation has somehow gotten focused on post-conviction representation when the actual representation is representation for immigration assistance, period.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. Jackson, how do you think the conversation got focused on post-conviction representation? How do you think we went there tonight? Is it because the representative from Viera said that they would look at post-conviction as part of the services?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is correct. I mean, that that obviously is a factor in the analysis. Councilmember Price, the point that I'm simply trying to make is, is that all the services are focused solely on immigration assistance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I have nothing further.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilor Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, it's hard to follow a conversation like that. I fully support these funds. I fully support it going to zero. I think we have already had these conversations behind the status around the the desire of the majority of this council to put these funds aside to make sure we can assist people in immigration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Unfortunately, their immigration status or situations that they get in, not all of them are because there's a criminal situation besides their immigration status. We have to remember that. And I think that those are the majority of cases that I've heard of in my district and in my surrounding districts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, honestly, the amount of money that we're putting out there is not not nearly as much as I personally believe we should have. And so I want to support Vera in this. I understand that they are going to be working directly with the the nonprofits that are based in our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So these funds are going to be based with Long Beach residents, with Long Beach organizations. They have the data, they have the experience of working with this population as their priority, not as just an addition to. And so I think that is one of the reasons why why not the Bar Association or Vera is because this is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'all they do. This is what they focus on. And I think it's the wisest way for us to spend our city tax dollars. So I would urge my colleagues to support this as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Before I go, I want to I know that Councilman Austin has queued up and think we're going back to the folks that have that gone already. So let me go to Councilman Austin first and I'll go back to the regular.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A schedule. Katherine Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, thank you. I just wanted to weigh in briefly and thank particularly the public commenters. Understand, staff has worked many months to put this policy or this this act together. And I want to thank my colleagues of excellent points this evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I am I'm in support of this in concept. I that I am intrigued with the and encouraged that so many community organizations are out in support of this. I think that makes our city at the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I read up on Vera. I am very impressed that with the work, the work that they're doing at the national level. But I think it's important also to all of our local stakeholders as well that that helps buy in for for the city of Long Beach and for for the people who who make up our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are some realities that we have to just, I think, understand, and that is that the bottom line here is our city our city council has committed to supporting families in our city and keep their families together. A reality is that we do have undocumented immigrants who live in our city and contribute to our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is a complicated issue. And in listening to the debate, I will just say that I understand the concerns over how resources will be used. But I think that the vast majority of those who will be served by this this fund will be those who won't be facing the offenses that are deportable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're going to be everyday citizens who are not necessarily citizens, obviously, but are going to be everyday residents who who support. I'm encouraged with the D e f the actual bonds. And I would just discourage anybody from thinking that or feeling that this this entire effort is about the money.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because I know that many of the organizations that are involved and have expressed support for this already and and many are not getting paid for it. So. So with that, I put the motion on. I'm I'm I'm happy to continue and hear the commentary from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some excellent points have been raised. But I would encourage that if there's an opportunity and a possibility to include the Lobbies Bar Association, we know that these are local stakeholders and folks who often live in our community as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They may be familiar, have some some some input, some more intimate familiarity. And it sounds like there's an opportunity for for everyone to work together. I hope we can land there. So those are my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. So Vice Mayor Andrews was was on the list and he nationally deleted it. So I'm going to put him back on there where he was and then Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. Thank you very much. I'm here. I was waiting to see how. Listen to all of our, you know, individuals in the diocese here, which I feel very strongly about this. They are just as fine because I when I first started by saying I'm supportive of the justice fund because despite of, you know, all the conversations as'",
        "'speaker_13': 'we sit here, we should embrace the diversity that we have. That is the and as a tribute to the immigration, you know, population living in our communities. You know, it's a large population of my district and it reside in the fear of reaching out because of their immigration status.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I'm always assuring them that we do not look at their status when providing services. And I want to thank Mrs. Jessica Quinten has been doing such a wonderful job with that situation there. And I stand by the immigration community and have a lot of respect for the stories behind each and every one of those.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I say that to say that I am truly and supported this. I've just as. Fine. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, councilman. Councilman. Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. You mentioned earlier that the qualifying factor would be income level. What is the income level for a single person that would be necessary to leverage the fund?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got it. We got it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I thought I read it was 200% below.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Poverty is 200% below poverty.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what is that number?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's 2% of the poverty level. We only have the calculation in front of us now for family for.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So is it divided by four, whatever number you have? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we'll let staff come up with that. So let's keep going and we'll get that number.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'd like to make a motion. I'd like to move that. The Justice Fund go directly to support Central Shore and or the Long Beach Bar Association or partnership thereof, all $250,000, and that it would go to help Long Beach residents with immigration services that are not related to a criminal conviction, with an intent to help most'",
        "'speaker_9': 'people, help the most people possible with a limit on any one case at $11,000. And here's a couple of reasons why the bar association has already come forward and willing to work with Central Shore directly at $2,500, a case that would serve a considerable more considerably more individuals.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In meeting with Long Beach attorneys, I met with and have talked to several some that have included interest are already doing this work in Long Beach today. And I kind of talked through with them the immigration court certified attorney work that can be done, illegal entry, illegal working dock, a conversion to work with expired work permit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Married to a U.S. citizen wanting a green card, immediate family member petition for green card, valid visa wanting a green card work, immigration. All of that is stuff that would be done at the 20 $500 rate. There's only one case that the attorneys talked about as a primary need to go up to $10,000 and they would be'",
        "'speaker_9': 'few and far between. They are the waivers of family based immigration and they are $10,000 flat fee. But I'm concerned that if we went with the $10,000 rate, the amount of people you would help is so many less.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if we were to want to help the most people possible, I also feel that 200% below the poverty level is just too low of an income. The individuals in our city who are working middle class and working at minimum wage would not qualify.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that to me is completely against what we're trying to accomplish here. If you are currently in Long Beach and you are working locally in one of our local businesses and living locally, you deserve the help. I don't know that I've heard of the reporting that is available through Viera, but I've heard that Central Shore and the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Long Beach Bar Association would both be willing to do that partnership. And so I would love to give the money directly to those organizations. Some people have said, Oh, well, you'd need an RFP for that. No, you wouldn't.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We can do a sole source directly to the organizations. Viera didn't have an RFP where multiple foundations came and competed to receive our funding, and so I hope that my colleagues will consider supporting directly funding these organizations, and I hope that they will work together and or come up with a flat rate structure that they would work'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on. I know that hope both of you know and many Shama have already stepped forward from the Bar Association, along with about a dozen other attorneys that have offered to step up and build to use their capacity exclusively for this over the next 12 months to ensure that every Long Beach resident who needs help can be served'",
        "'speaker_9': '. And so cheers to both Jessica and Paul for stepping up. I think that the work that you guys could do together would be amazing and I would be 100% supportive and I hope that I'll have the support of my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a second motion. So that's the motion on the floor. We saw the first motion as well. Let me go and keep going down the speaker's list, Councilor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to the public who attended this evening to to inform the council of your opinions on this. And thank you to my colleagues for the conversation. So I want to be clear on unequivocally clear on where where I where I stand here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is a reality that our communities face, and that reality is that our criminal justice system is flawed and the deportation system abuse does take place. Deportation is a federal process that does have an impact on local communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Therefore, it is the business of the City Council and our local communities to think about establishing funds or mechanisms to protect the integrity and security of our communities. So it is appropriate. Secondly, I was really impressed by the Viera Institute, particularly the way that they handled themselves tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It really demonstrated they have a cultural sensitivity and they approached this issue with the right lens. Therefore, it appears to me that they are the correct entity to handle this. So that said, I would like to continue with Vera.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to offer a substitute substitute motion that encompasses the original main motion, but also provides implementation, provides an implementation timeline, as well as reporting to the City Council on the establishment of the fund, as well as so we can understand the levels, how this how this fund is going to continue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's that's what I that's my substitute substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Now we have a substitute substitute, which is essentially the staff recommendation, but also an implementation timeline as well. Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I appreciate the substitute substitute. And I think everybody for their comments. I will just say one thing I actually have here, a. I just wanted to make sure I'm hitting this point correctly. Every situation is unique and different.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one situation happened here in Long Beach, Mr. Falso. He was seeking a direct pardon for a second degree robbery offense committed in 1998 when he was 17 years old. He was transferred to adult court and tried as an adult, something that would not happen under today's reformed juvenile laws championed by Governor Brown.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the nearly two decades that have passed since his conviction, Mr. Silk has redeemed himself by pursuing his education, regularly attending church and becoming a beloved community leader. He actually worked with the Youth Justice Coalition in Los Angeles, an organization that collaborated with governors, the governor's team on many important juvenile justice reforms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In July 2015, Mr. Sock became one of the very first few offenders, first youth offenders, to be released pursuant to S.B. 260, exemplifying Governor Brown's commitment to giving people who committed crimes in their youth a true second chance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, I wrote a letter for him, and that was one out of a thousand pardons that Governor Brown succeeded in conducting before he left office and before he will leave office before the year end. So I just want to make sure that every situation is extremely different.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That person was a Long Beach resident, has a second chance now, given the opportunity. And so I hope we can stay on this. Substitute substitute motion. I truly believe in in this work, because this is the majority of our residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is not just something that we as council colleagues think is political. It's the right thing to do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember customary Ringo Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I also was going to provide a bit of a real life example that happened here in Long Beach about two years ago with Mr. Gonzales. Mr. Gonzalez was a law abiding citizen in the city limits for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': '20 years ago, he got convicted of of possession of a drug, got convicted, was served. His time was released and then continued to have a family. His kid, his son was an Army veteran, served in the armed forces, came back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then because of some quirk in our justice system, his car, his vehicle was pulled over while he was picking up his son from Cal State, Long Beach, the Long Beach PD was outside its jurisdiction, stopped them for a busted tail light, basically did a background check on them, let them go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were ready to go. The car stopped again. The PD, the Long Beach Police Department, stopped him again with what's up? They did a more thorough search, found that he had been deported. And what's he doing back? This is a perfect example of where this defense fund would have come in, very useful for for Mr. Gonzales and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would have kept him here. He got deported for the very exact reason that Councilmember Price is saying if you're convicted of something, you're going to be deported, you're going to be deported. He was living an exemplary life after his conviction, paid his dues, raised his family, and now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He's a broken family. He's in Mexico, can't come back. And his family is now broken up and they have to go visit him down in Mexico. I was I was with Congressman Lowenthal. We went down to the border to Liberty Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we walked to the fences. You could barely touch your finger to that fence. And it was the most heartbreaking experience I had ever had ever had in this regard. So this motion that's on the floor now with the amendments I saw, I support the substitute substitute motion on this because it is it is the right thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to do. And let's vote for it now. Mayor Councilors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to clarify that. Thank you, Mr. West. I have the two clarifications here. Councilman Surinam.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'd also like to thank all the speakers here tonight and especially the students from Cal State, Long Beach. Your stories were very compelling and I think we all support you. I don't want to be repetitive because my position hasn't changed here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I support the fund. What I asked for at the last council meeting was that we look for a local alternative. The difference here tonight is I think we just have a very valid, viable local alternative. And so I'm going to support the substitute motion, and it's better than I had hoped for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when the Bar Association stated that they would return the money, they're not going to use. That seemed incredibly efficient to me. If anyone knows anything about my council office, we run on efficiency or at least try to do so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council woman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I appreciate what you mentioned. Council member Super or not, I don't think there would be any leftover. I hope that there wouldn't. I hope that we'd be able to help that many people. And should the motion on the floor fail?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would be open to making it exclusive. All 250,000 to central chair. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So as it stands, I support the sub. I know there's at least one other colleague queued up to talk. I would like this fund to go towards. Immigrants who are fighting deportation not as a result of a current criminal conviction.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if there's any way my colleagues are willing to work with me on that, I'm putting it out there. I think it's very important for us. I'm still unclear based on Mr. Jackson's comments and the comments from the representatives of Vera Institute, whether public moneys are going to be used for post-conviction issues in criminal cases.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If that's the case, I have a major problem with that. We have a public defender's office and state and county taxes that go towards funding criminal defense. And we can argue all day long whether that's sufficient or not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I agree. There's probably a lot more that needs to be done to bolster criminal defense. But I do not think we should be using public money to fund individual lawsuits and certainly not public monies to be funding individual criminal defense.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just don't think that's where we should be spending public money. And although Mr. Jackson believes that people are charged commonly inappropriately as a prosecutor of 20 years, I can say that I know and understand the system very well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And when deportation proceedings are started on an individual, it's because they've committed recently a crime that qualifies as one of the aggravated felonies or misdemeanors. I don't think we should be using public moneys to help those individuals fight their individual legal battles.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think we should be saving that money for Long Beach residents who are facing deportation as a result of no action on their part. No wrongdoing on their part. They've applied for DOCA application, or they're cooperating with the police and with law enforcement as a witness in a case or a victim in a domestic violence case.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they're applying for a U visa. That's where we should be. Spending money if we're going to spend money is helping people who have applied for a U visa, people who are trying to do their part as victims of crime or as witnesses of crime.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's where our focus should be. That at least should be the priority. I don't think we should be spending city dollars to participate in post-conviction work for a criminal setting. I think that's way beyond the scope of how this justice fund was presented by our mayor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't know that that was the intent of it. To be honest, I don't know. I didn't propose it. But I think it far exceeds the scope of trying to help people who are fighting immigration battles stay in the country.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So my my friendly would be that the money not be used for any post-conviction criminal work, but rather to help people fight their immigration cases. Iris Independent of any criminal action that they have suffered that is causing their deportation and I would ask that that friendly be approved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council member I think Kevin. Mr. Jackson, Deputy City Manager Jackson did a good job in articulating and so did the Beer Institute that there's already a process in place and they would simply explain that process as a part of their right to have a consultation about their documentation status.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm actually comfortable with that and I want to I'll have the mic just say what an amazing job that Kevin Jackson and the Office of Equity that Katie have done in putting this together. So I don't want that to go unnoticed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I appreciate that and I look forward to continuing great work like this with the both of you. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So just one last comment. I appreciate that. Even within the talks that I had with Maneesh and the others at the Bar Association, one of the things that they warned us against and I think it's important to state if we went with the substitute substitute motion, certain legal defenses that include a criminal defendant are upwards of $15,000'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and that's on the low end. And at $15,000, we're only going to get to help 16 Long Beach residents, one 616 and for $250,000. I just hope that we would put it in a way that would help the most people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Paving a street in the district at $250,000 helps 200 people plus their children who need safety on their community. And and I'm not saying that one is more important than the other tonight. We're only talking about one. But I think that one of our responsibilities as councilmember supervisor said, is efficiency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I would like to support the justice fund. I'd like to support central charge. I'd like to support the Bar Association. I'd like to support the money going locally. But I can't support the substitute substitute because I just don't think that $250,000 for 15 residents is is the equitable and efficient way to spend the funding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'll be supporting the substitute motion, not the sub something you were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I did want to add and I forgot last time that I fully support the money going to our local organizations to administer as they see fit and keeping the money within the city of Long Beach because nobody knows the Long Beach community better than the organizations that are working in it every day.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I would support the money going either to Central Shore or the Long Beach Bar Association or a hybrid, as Councilwoman Mongo mentioned. So I would be supporting the sub and not the sub sub. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Two clarifications. I want to make sure that for the record, before we go to a vote, the first is that the sub sub includes Councilman Gonzalez's original motion, which was the staff recommendation and her amendment. And and also, of course, the the additions that Councilmember Richardson said and then that the fund would also, as per'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the staff report, I believe it's its Long Beach residents and those that work within Long Beach. Just to clarify that as well, that's I believe in the staff report as well. So there is a motion and a second on on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Members, please go and cast your votes. Oh, I'm sorry. We had.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To substitute.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Associates who are represented by Jen Daughtery as well as Henry Ponte Morelli. I want to just acknowledge that this was a really a challenging task and it was really important that we took the time to get it right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And a part of that was making sure that we listened to the community, that we listened well to all sides of the issue. And I think what you'll find is that the ultimate recommendation that staff will be presenting tonight reflects not only that we heard all sides of the issue, but that we also considered a number of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'other factors, such as city housing policy. We considered best practices in the industry and what was legally permissible and what made sense in terms of an implementation perspective. So with that, what I'd like to do is to have our consultant, Jane Daughtery, she'll be presenting an overview of the work that the consultant was engaged in.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'd just like to highlight that it includes a wealth of data. So whether it's tonight at some later time, if you could certainly defer to the report because it does contain a wealth of data about the topic of stars that we won't be covering tonight in detail.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But it is a very good resource for you to keep in mind. And also after the consultants presentation, they will be turning it back over to staff so that we can summarize the staff recommendation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Ms.. Tatum Mayor, council members, thank you very much. This presentation, I will go through some high level background information that includes the process, data and community input. Then I'll describe the three short term rental ordinance options in front of you before handing it back to Ms..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Tatum. Our approach for this process was organized into three phases, the first being research and analysis, where we conducted two public workshops. An online survey was completed and we conducted case study research. The second phase, that's the phase we're in today is looking at alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In that phase, we developed preliminary options. We presented them at a public workshop and we prepared a draft analysis included in your packet tonight. The third phase is looking at code amendments and public hearings, and us moving forward with that phase is going to be dependent on the direction we receive from counsel tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To understand what's happening with Long Beach short term rentals, we collected publicly available data from short term rental hosting websites, and the data was collected in March of this year. This data found that there are 1532 active listings in the city, and of those, 1328 are actual individual units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While that looks like a lot of dots on the map, that comprises just under 1% of the city's total housing stock. These stars are not distributed evenly across the city. They're primarily concentrated along the coast and in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the colors represent different websites as TR websites. And the dominant website operating in is Airbnb with about 80% of the listings that's followed by the Expedia owned platforms, HomeAway and VRBO at about 12%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About half of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The listings are single family and about half multifamily. 52% multifamily. 48% single family. Two thirds of those are listings for entire homes and about a third for partial homes. Partial homes meaning that it's a listing for a bedroom or a portion of a home versus the entire unit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About half.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'About half of those listings are listed at a nightly rate of no more than $100 per night. And about half of those are estimated. Half of the overall listings are estimated to generate no more than $10,000 of revenue per year to the host.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Based on the average long term apartment rate in the city, a short term rent and assuming a short term rental average nightly rate of $100 per night, that star would need to be rented an occupancy of about 44% or rented about 13 nights per month to generate more revenue than an average long term rental apartment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In looking at the number of nights per year stars are rented. About half or 654 units are estimated estimated to be rented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'More than 90 nights per year. The orange dashed line is showing that threshold of the 90 nights per year and on the on the green bars that's identifying of those rentals, which are entire home units. So, for example, on the right hand side, those units that are rented for 180 nights or more are 380.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And 140 of those are entire home rentals. Now the majority of hosts, almost 83%, have only one star listed. Just over 10% have two. It's about 93% of all listings are two or fewer short term rentals. Now, this may be overstated as professional operators have begun to list individual host IDs so it isn't appearing as though they'",
        "'speaker_7': 'have multiple units. Community input has been a substantial part of our process and some consistent themes have emerged through this, through the various outreach efforts and activities we've had. Those themes include positive ones, such as the reliance and supplemental income that staffers provide to hosts and property owners, and that that income is allowing property owners to maintain'",
        "'speaker_7': 'their property to make improvements to their property that they wouldn't otherwise be able to. And also that guess of short term rental units are supporting local businesses. We also heard negative themes complaints about noise, parties, parking primarily, or especially in coastal areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also heard concern about overall lack of enforcement and concerns of staffers impact on the availability and affordability of housing. Considering the community input we received, we began to prepare some preliminary options for for short term rental regulations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also considered, in addition to that community input the city's current code. We looked at zoning and other provisions of the code, existing conditions in Long Beach and case study research. Now our research look at looks in-depth at four specific jurisdictions, but we looked at dozens of of case studies in California and nationwide to supplement our efforts'",
        "'speaker_7': 'here. We also also evaluated the California Coastal Commission's position on short term rentals and assessed potential city costs and potential city revenues from regulating short term rentals. The three options that were developed consist of the first being a baseline level regulation as the lowest level of regulation out of the three options.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The second is a limited starters option. This adds additional regulation on top of those baseline restrictions. Lastly, an option, the third option and geographic to opt out is proposed that has additional level of restriction on top of one and two.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are the three regular or three options were presented at the last public workshop we had in October, and we provided some additional information to help explain the three options. The first baseline regulations includes registering short term rentals with the city, including the city's registration number in every listing for that TR.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Providing a local 24 hour contact. Providing the rules for the str noise where to park and trash recycling egress routes ahead of the guest stays as well as posting those rules within the unit. Property liability insurance of at least a minimum of at least $1 million would be required.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And some platforms offer this and that provision of insurance would satisfy this requirement. The payment of transient occupancy tax or TOTTY at the city's established rate of 12%. This is a tax that is paid by the guest, collected by the host or operator and remitted to the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also the business license tax, which currently for residential rentals, is about $80 a parcel and about $35 per each unit. And that's on an annual basis. As teachers would be prohibited in deed, restricted affordable housing units and dormitories.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this option also includes a 24 hour hotline. That would be a method to report and address nonemergency complaints. And the city would also offer a prohibited buildings list where staffers or short term rental activity is not allowed by homeowners associations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And C hours could apply a request to the city to include their development, their properties on the permitted buildings list. And the city would not issue STR registrations for those units. And finally, STR registration would be revoked under this option if three violations occurred within a 12 month period.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, those aren't complaints. Those are violations. So if violations of these established regulations occur three in 12 months, your registration would be revoked and couldn't be renewed for one year. Option two builds upon and further restricts the regulations in option one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Limited staffers would limit staffers to residents of Long Beach. That would be verified through vehicle registration, IDs, utility bills, and it would allow for one primary primary residence. As Esther, now a resident, must occupy the primary residence for at least 275 nights per year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's about nine months for that to be qualified as a resident. In addition to the primary residence str a resident would be allowed to have two non primary residence staffers, so those non primary staffers would have no restriction on the number of nights hosted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For parcels that have two or more units, such as a single family home with an adu or a duplex. Only one of those units would be required to be occupied for 275 nights per year, with the other unit having no restrictions on the nights rented.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the city is still the city is coordinating with legal counsel on this resident requirement. And if if it is something continuing to evaluate it, if if it is something that must be removed from these options, the primary residence requirement could be revised to be at the parcel level.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now an additional restriction is included for under the limited staffers options for multifamily developments. And as previously mentioned, you must be a resident in Long Beach under this option to be able to operate in a STR and you could only have up to two non primary residence stars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So to limit the concentration of these non primary staffers in multifamily developments, those staffers are capped at 25% or no more than six in multifamily developments. So for example, this is particularly relevant when there's multiple owners or hosts in one building, but also in the case of, say, a single apartment building owner, that owner would have to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be a resident of Long Beach and would be limited to up to two non primary residence staffers. If the apartment building is an eight unit building or larger, those two non primary residence staffers could be located in that building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The limited upstairs option also includes quiet hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., during which outdoor pools and hot tubs could not be used. It limits occupants to two people per bedroom plus two with a maximum of ten people per TR.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Large scale events would be prohibited, as would exterior signage. The last option, the geographic opt out adds an additional restriction where Unhosted stars could be prohibited within designated air areas through a petition process and vote of the residents within that area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, Unhosted means that the resident would be would not be present during the guest's stay, and this option evolved out of the continuing feedback from certain neighborhoods about the disturbance stars were having in those areas. Now many cities have begun to regulate stars, and we've looked at a number of them and some range from very simple and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'strict. Like Santa monica, where stars are only allowed if they're hosted, if the host is on on the premise during the rental activity to more lenient but cumbersome like Sacramento where they have different permit requirements for non primary residence stars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is no standard model for STR regulations that applies universally across all cities. But the options we have presented include elements that have been instituted in different cities. And I think at that point, I'll hand it back to Miss Tatum.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, John. I would like to now just summarize the staff's recommendation. John talked a lot about in detail about option two. That is the option that staff is recommending. We think that it appropriately balances all of the the market that we have here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But in particular, it also addresses specifically issues of community character. Our recommendation was guided by the fact that we clearly want to be able to benefit residents, local residents with the proposal. But we also want to be sure that we're addressing community concerns and mitigating those concerns through appropriate regulation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're also concerned with making sure that the program includes a cost recovery component. So with that, staff is recommending option to the other direction that we're asking for. The city council is to direct us to enter into agreements with the the hosting platforms and that would enable the city to collect the transit occupancy task tax.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we'd also be asking Council's direction for to direct staff to continue to study the appropriate fee to address the affordable housing issue. We feel that it's important that that is a consideration in this item, but we will need to go back and do studies to determine to determine the appropriate share of the fees that are collected'",
        "'speaker_11': ', how much of those fees should go to affordable housing? Because we've also we also need to address cost recovery efforts to cover the costs of implementation of the program. And I would like to highlight a couple of points that we have very intentionally included in the regulations for option two that do address housing and affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To note that as cars are currently, they are prohibited in any of the city's deed restricted affordable housing units. We also very specifically limited and thought really carefully about the limit that we are proposing in terms of limiting the number of short term rentals per each host.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are also considering the impact to the affordable housing stock when we also very specifically limit the number of units within each multifamily housing project. And again, we are very supportive of including a component of the fees for this effort to go towards affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we will be taking a look at what that appropriate share should be, because, again, we have anticipated a share of the cities of these fees going into the current city budget, and we're hoping to hit those targets.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And again, with some additional study we will be bringing back to the City Council once if you direct us to prepare the ordinance, we would be bringing back an appropriate analysis of what that affordable housing share should be.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So with that, that concludes staff's presentation. And the staff here at this table, as well as our consultant, will be available to answer your specific questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I know there's been a lot of work that's gone into this and a lot of community input. There is a motion on the floor which I know there's going to be some conversation about that that will likely change some.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we're going to take public comment for the makers of the motion so far. 1/2. I am. Before before everyone jumps up, everyone will get a chance to speak. This gentleman in the front is going to be controlling the public comment so we can't have bunching up like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Guys, we're going to call. So it's one line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Close to the start over on this side.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I didn't bring up that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyone will get a chance to speak. So please take direction right now and we will get ready for public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm. Yeah. Well, you can go ahead of me. Thank you. Okay. You can't be doing this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're okay. Just be a minute. We have a lot of people that make sure we get them in line for public comment. So. Guys, just just just to be very clear, we have two lines going on here. I can't have two lines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I need one line of speakers. And if that's not if people aren't going to fit, they need to take a seat and we will get to you. I need one line. I have multiple lines of people coming up and down this row.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I need about the last third of this in this line. It needs to grab it, take a seat or go to the other section. He's got it, please. And then if I can have you guys just kind of straighten out a little bit, that'd be great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Share of the tension, please. Okay. We're going to go ahead and start.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just America to be recognized. Sure. I counted just in this about 50 people just on this side, and I didn't realize the rest of that was also speaker's line. So there were 50 here and there's probably another 50 there, maybe 30 at 3 minutes each.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's that's exactly 5 hours of public comment. So respect. Respectfully, there has been significant input and community meetings. So, Mr. Mayor, I would move that. We go to we go to 90 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, dear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're second on that. I'll just say consensus on that if there's consensus. Unless there's any objection. Okay. We will go to we will go to 90 seconds. You can set that clerk at 90 seconds. Okay. Okay. We will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please, everyone, quiet down. Shush. I want to make sure that everyone that speaks has a chance to be heard. Please begin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, Mayor and City Council. My name is Barbara Schweiger. I live in the eighth district. My family and I have enjoyed several short term rentals, but we also live on a block that has two very large homes which are rented out for short terms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The problem is not with people when the host is in the in the house.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The problem is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When the entire house is rented out with no owner to supervise. Generally speaking, the visitors are quiet and act like good neighbors. However, there have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Been a number of instances.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where very large part large parties have occurred, where trucks appear with professional caterers, extensive bars, elaborate decorations, loud bands, deejays or other entertainment which disrupt homes and families well beyond the boundaries of the property. And parking can be impacted for several blocks around.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have had big parties. We invite our neighbors and we don't disturb the neighbor beyond our home. We stayed at an Airbnb in Philadelphia, where my husband and I had the largest room on the third floor. However, there was one small.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Window and it was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Painted shut and there were no smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors in the home. We went out and bought a hammer and chisel to crack the window in case of fire. On another occasion there was a serious leak, which the owner asked us to fix in their dark and scary basement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Based on this, I urge you to license and tax short term rentals. Mandate periodic. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's quick. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Really need inspection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm bringing it to court and I live on Locust Avenue. There's an Airbnb right next door to me that's basically a commercial venue. They have weddings, they have deejays, they have live bands. They make the windows rattle in my home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My guide dog shakes at times that she can't even sleep and I can't leave. I'm stuck. Because it's where I live and I can't afford to just move. When I bought the home for retirement. There's another Airbnb that's across the street and down on the same block that I live on, and they do the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've corresponded with both of them with no results. We call the phone number. That's the non-emergency phone number, and we get no results for hours and hours at a time. I sat on the phone one day for over an hour with no response to the non-emergency number that were supposed to call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then when we do call him, there's times I can't even leave my home because if I go left, the driveways are blocked with cars that are parked over hanging over him. When I go the other direction, it's the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm stuck in all kinds of positions that no one's helping me get out of. I adore Airbnb. I adore Furbo when they're done right. But when they don't care about people with disabilities to give us workouts out and they don't, they keep us trapped for 8 to 10 hours at a time with loud music DJs and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'live bands and catered events. Help us out. Thank you.'",

I've been through this process in our other home. Six years ago in Jackson, Wyoming, and we had a successful solution to it.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'All six varied interests from the tourists to the resort operators to the neighborhood, it is operating successfully. So with that reason, I participated in this process. I've solicited the entire peninsula and received responses from virtually everybody. And option whatever option can gain five council votes would be our preference that it would include and respect the right of'",
        "'speaker_15': 'self-determination like we have enjoyed with some of the other code processors, and that would include the designated area that has the right of that self-determination to include whether we should have hosted in UN hosted homes.

        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, my name is Martha Briscoe and I live in the area that the first two speakers spoke of. So I have experienced the large scale events. So I'm wondering how you all will define large scale events. Because my neighbor, who has turned a what had been formerly a residential home next to my retirement home, decided that it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was a really great idea to start having weddings, all kinds of parties, all kinds of events, very, very commercial, the parking and all of that sort of thing. So even if even when there have been people there that have only been like 20 people, they can make a lot of noise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as the former speaker just said, it's really difficult just having code enforcement. We've got to have measures to support neighbors who are being offended and stressed out on a weekly basis with no real hope that there's going to be some kind of disciplinary action that is going to result in real change when so much money is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'being made hand over fist by these folks that have their have their rental at the expense of the quiet neighbors who don't. So please define large scale events.

I rent out two of my bedrooms depending upon how many I have 11 grandchildren, so lots of time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's other people there. My one comment is I'm very happy that we would be paying room tax. I love the city of Long Beach. I want it to have what it needs. I was very sad when the 2008 crisis sent us to our knees and it's just never really recovered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I would like to talk about that 12%, 6% of the hotel money for their taxes being used to advertise for the hotels. That will not be done for Airbnb or other short terms, which is fine with me, but I don't think an additional amount of money besides that 6% needs to be taken from us.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'And I know that if you're going to play ball, it's going to be wasting our time. But, you know, we come from the United States of America where there's liberty. And I'd like to push back on some government regulation now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the because I think we're highly, highly overregulated right now. Also, what is the big fervor about stars? I'd just like to think out of the box.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've had some long term renters. Where I live.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Beside that have been worse partiers than I'd heard on some of these stories here that I've heard of the nightmare stories of short term rentals. Thirdly, when my wife and I took over our property in Belmont Shore, we had two drug pushers that were growing pots in our in the house that we purchased and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Selling it on the street. And we finally.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Kicked them out. After $10,000 of attorney fees, our neighbors thanked us for turning our house around. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wow. How do I follow that? Okay. Good evening. Good evening, Mayor and Council. My name is Linda. I'm a resident taxpayer of Second District. Many years ago, I was working as a traveling sales representative. And at that time, my company was giving me a stipend of $60 a night for overnight travel for a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you can imagine the type of hotels I might be able to afford. That was when I discovered Airbnb. I was able to find shelter in a safe, secure, affordable, clean home with awesome hosts. That was over eight years ago, and I've been part of the home sharing community ever since.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My decision to become an Airbnb host started when my husband was laid off on my birthday, no less. And I a week later, the fear of losing our home in the city we've come to love was overwhelming. The Airbnb platform helped us through some very difficult times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please don't lose that in this conversation that people are really using this as a forum to survive. Okay. And please remember that the sharing community cards, Lyft, Uber, Airbnb, all of that started because of a need, a need to find affordable ways to get around and an affordable way to travel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We met amazing people, a couple in their son from Kazakhstan who won the visa lottery and a couple from New York who needed who needed to find a home. And they now live here in Long Beach on First Street and our loyal customers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I really prefer no regulations, but if I could just number one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi, I'm Diana Wynne and I live downtown Long Beach. What got me into hosting was that I. I love to travel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I traveled all over abroad.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I didn't know what Airbnb was. And and so when I did, I started looking into it and it gave me options to giving up my family options of of where we can stay. And once when I got into it, I'm like, oh, my gosh, this is so much better than a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I got myself into hosting here at my kind of Long Beach, and the experience I have has been phenomenal. You know, they I have so far zero complaints. And the platform.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Allows you to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Actually rate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Each other, not just rate me, but rate them. And so if you're able to look at them and say, hey.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, they have bad reviews, whatever, but I hadn't had one that had a bad review.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I've allowed each one to stay in my home. I'm also, in a way, board member. And to me, the complaints that I have is actually for the more of the long term renters. And to say that it's it's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just the short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's making noise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that's unfair because, you know, we were surrounded by great universities, colleges, and we've all been.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There, right. We partied.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so just to say that it's just for the short term, it's not right to say so it could be any of those factors, not just, you know, people that are trying to, you know, give options, working.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Options, but if we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have Airbnb.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Josh Butler, executive director of Housing Long Beach, a resident of the third district. And I am a super renter. There are so many unintended consequences with this. It feels like this policy at this point is half baked and there's more work to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One for sure is, is what is the fare going to be and where is the money going to go? It doesn't make sense to me to come back and circle around and have that conversation. That should be included as part of this conversation right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that money should go to affordable housing. And I think that the hosts are lucky that it's only a minimum of 12%. We're in a housing crisis. We do not have enough affordable housing as is we do not have places for our current renters to be right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's very discouraging that so many host have come up here and decided, rather than to speak about the positives of being a host, have chosen to disparage longtime Long Beach renters in the process of this. There are a lot of rules and regulations out there right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm wondering how it's going to be monitored. Is it going to be done by current staff? Do we have the funding to do that? How many calls for service to the police department will go out? And is any of the funding going to support the police department?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's a lot of questions that still remain to be answered. All these hosts have come up here. It sounds like they're struggling to. Many of them have suggested that without the ability to rent out their second home, that they would be underwater.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think that we may have a larger problem if so many of our homeowner population are struggling to make ends meet. We might want to look a little bit deeper at that. So we encourage you to look at an individual option, which was the Santa monica option.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Passed over, which requires the owner to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Llanos with Airbnb.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much for allowing us to be here today and for really a thoughtful process that has undergone over a year of community feedback. I think you've heard better from our hosts today the stories of how.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Airbnb.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is impacting everyday Long Beach residents and really allowing them to stay in their homes, cover important housing costs, medical costs, supplement retirement medical bills in many situations. These are also ambassadors of Long Beach who really take pride in being able to welcome thousands of guests into this community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, in 2017, this resulted in about $42 million of new spending in local businesses right here in Long Beach, supporting jobs, helping folks be able to stay and live in Long Beach. We appreciate all of the work that's gone into putting together this policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A couple of suggestions that that we want to urge you to consider. I think, one, you did call for a community feedback process. Your community asked you for option one, consider that. Hear their their voices. They were engaged.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you want to look deeper, I think we really would consider you to look at eliminating caps for the nights that people can share the homes they live in. These folks are going to take care of their community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're going to take care of their homes. You're going to solve for a lot of these neighborhood character and safety concerns. I think vacation rentals have existed historically in Long Beach. I think there should be a way to legitimize them through this process, but create the rules that actually solve for the noise and concerns that frankly, can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'happen in long term stays as well as short term stays. We want to be your partner in this process very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Actually you're providing a hotel, you're not doing it because you like to have people come. Different people come every week and stay with you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You're doing it for the money. As such, you're operating in a for profit business, just like any business like the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That the city. You should be able you should pay a yearly license because again, I think it's important that the city knows how.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Many hotels are operating inside the city. Not only should they have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That information, but they should share it with the police and the fire department so the fire they can respond better. That's why I think it's important. Yet when it comes to the overall, I think my biggest issue is with buildings, five units and above.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are not home sharing. These are commercial operations. And the city is at a minimum, I would hope that they would support the, you know, the 25%. But if they do that, I would hope that the landlords would be required to notify their long term.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Applicants that they're they're also hosting short term.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rentals in that building. But in my opinion, I think it's best that these buildings were not built to be hotels. Again, it's going to be hard to implement this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'When inspectors going to go and be inspected as a hotel or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An apartment building. Again, there's a lot of confusion, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Very best that unless.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, the only way to have short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In apartment buildings is if they're converted, if they're zoned and permitted to operate as a hotel, because basically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know any landlords that are living in there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My gosh, that number thing is really intimidating. My name is Natalie Barnes. I'm the proud owner of a home in Long Beach, and my home is a duplex and it resides in District three. I have been hosting vacation rentals and more recently Airbnb Rentals for the last eight years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to present a little bit more positive glimpse of what a host goes through. While many of the visitors may come from outside of our community, they come here for the community. The guests that I've had have been visiting nurses that take care of our community in our hospitals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They have been project managers that have built things for our community, and they have even been people that have come here because they want to eventually transition and live here and become a part of our community as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's another part of that which are. The people within our community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That are looking for places to stay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope that you'll consider all of this when you consider what you're voting for. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Marianne Gleason and I'm in District three. I'm on the peninsula. I've lived there for 16 years and I have a duplex. I've started short term rentals because of my elderly parents come out from the East Coast for about three months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're snowbirds and they come up for the winter. So the balance of the months, I thought, Oh, it'd be nice to rent out, since it's hard for me to rent out full term lease, a full year lease. Anyways, I take pride in I'm on a very visible area on the peninsula, I'm on the boardwalk and pretty much'",
        "'speaker_2': 'everyone knows what I'm doing because I see people there, new people and and they really like to see the new people and the new wherever they're from, the countries. And I really I've had no zero problems. I have parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm I'm upstairs. I'm very village vigilant about parties and, you know, no weddings. No, there's no that it's very, very restrictive. I know that some of the people that came up here this evening. On Peninsula are obviously against it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One person there's one person I think is the only person that is having a problem. There's there's one short term rental. So I would like to probably maybe help with that person to oversee. And I'll do my best to, you know, help whatever I can do to make sure that there's not a problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I approve of option two. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long night, huh? My name is Zach Kaczynski. I'm a resident of the fifth District and also an on income property in the third. I've emailed all of you my word. So I'm going to just stick to my main objection here and my proposed solution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Short term rentals are to be held to the same standards for noise ordinance rules as long term rentals. However, all three options proposed hold STR landlords directly liable for tenant violations based solely on the length of tenancy beyond the costly logistical hurdles involved with enforcement, the shoulders of the landlord with culpability for violations they themselves did not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'commit. And this is wrong. Landlords should not be required to maintain an asinine 24 hour complaint complaint hotline. We already have a hotline in place and that's in the form of the Long Beach Police Department. Transient occupancy tax revenue should be prioritized to ensure that the PD is adequately staffed with patrol cars, operators and dispatchers to handle'",
        "'speaker_3': 'any influx in disturbance calls with a focus on patrolling areas with higher densities of rentals. This is fair, it makes sense, and it's funded directly by the STR tenants themselves through tort revenue without creating a bloated, unnecessary licensing, registration and enforcement system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Next.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'The time is now for Long Beach and other cities to adopt an ordinance that is a true reflection of what the region needs as we face the biggest housing crisis of our lives. Other cities, such as Santa monica, consider the grave impacts short term rentals have on their housing, stock and hotel industries and incorporated this understanding into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'their ordinance. The City Council of Long Beach has the responsibility to do the same. I urge you to take a strong action to protect the future of the families in the area. You have the opportunity to be a leader in the nation and you should take it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello. My name is Pedro alone. Thank you for allowing me to speak today. I have been living in Long Beach for around almost three years. I live in many places in the United States. I currently will be able to leave behind my corporate job to begin managing property here in the Philippines.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And one thing that I would like to mention to properly address one of the recent comments of the diff. Limiting the number for rental in the long term industry will definitely affect the rental market, but in a negative way because a lot of millennials like me will not be buying property if in a place where they are'",
        "'speaker_8': 'limited. I myself have been thinking about buying a full plate and if that is limited in number for rent of that, I can have, I will look for what else I will buy, for what I will now buy here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And a lot of people will do the same thing. But I love Long Beach and I think that you guys would probably look at this in a very fair way for everybody that will work in a way that everybody would be happy at the end.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I, I forgive the probably the best option would be number one, even though I think the total is a little too high because we are not hotels and. One of the things that I wanted to mention is that the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That we do not support the platform liability. And I think the option it too is way too confusing for a lot of people and does not address all the issues that you want to address. Thank you. Good evening, counsel.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Michael O'Toole and I represent Naples Islanders there. Homeowner's Association President. I think these are some amazing stories. First of all, I've never been in a room like this with this many.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Owners of or.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Workers with the BMB. It's beautiful, the nice stories, but what I think we're getting caught up in a little bit is forgetting it's not just hosts. They're also renting out complete houses. And I think that's a little bit more of a concern.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Down in Naples Island, it's a community. It was it was built in 1905. It's a bedroom community. It's got a school right in the middle of it. It's got family houses, single family houses throughout. And by entering into the VRBO world, renting out entire house, it really changes the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It changes the makeup of it, it changes the traffic pattern, it changes the parking. It's a little bit different. If a host is there, they can control what's going on in the House. They can control what their neighborhood is like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They control what the how all the neighborhoods get along and how they park and where they park and how they go about their business in that neighborhood. When you start adding homes that don't have any of that control, it gets a little bit tougher.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think the Airbnb concept is beautiful and you've heard a thousand stories tonight that make that that make a good argument for that. But let's not forget, and you seem to be forgetting this VR part, where they rent out an entire house and a bedroom community changes that community tremendously.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So along with the beautiful stories, let's think about the big houses, too. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Johanna Cunningham and I'm founder and CEO for the National Short Term Rental in India. This industry is certainly growing, as we've heard, and we want to make sure that we were that we're exploring all of the different options.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have three issues that I'd like to speak to tonight. Number one is the transient occupancy tax. Short term rentals don't even come close to offering what hotels offer. Businesses and families use short term rentals as a way to be able to come to cities that they would be unable to afford in any other way spas, restaurants'",
        "'speaker_2': ', workout rooms, events, sites, pools, parking. None of those are usually offered in short term rentals, but they are in hotels. The families are able to afford the opportunity to travel without the high prices that hotels charge. It is a different experience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, short term rentals provide the city of Long Beach more tourist dollars. They're able to to experience and attend stores. They're able to go to restaurants, and they're supporting the viability of the job market so small and mid-sized business owners are able to thrive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second is the annual business license requirement. Owners are already paying property tax as it is a private residence. Owners are trying to do what they can to supplement their income, and we don't want to cross over into private property rights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The last is a multifamily. Thank you. And we want to make sure that thank you at least do in part something to support this industry. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'John Dilatory, resident of the eighth where I have my home sharing within my house, and then also a property in the second and third district. Honorable Mayor and Council Members, Thank you for the opportunity to share with you an exciting opportunity that has been what an exciting opportunity has been to host people in my home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have had people from every corner of the world and have taken every chance to share our passion for Long Beach. Many foreigner foreign guests do the usual. They go to the West Coast vacation of San Francisco, L.A., Anaheim, Las Vegas and maybe San Diego.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of them have no idea what to do in Long Beach, and we take that opportunity to offer them and steer them to all parts of Long Beach, Pine Avenue and ST Sinners in the first Retro Row and the Socialists in the second, second street and open sesame in the third.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most goes on and on through each of the districts that we know and we share with these people and send them to the two main concerns found by the Wise Consultant Group where housing stock and noise parties. They also found that only 0.75% of the housing stock are stars, and many are like me with a room in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'their home that would not be available as housing stock if things were to change. So housing stock should not be a concern. As for noise parties, we have a noise ordinance in place that is taken care of by our police department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I feel a modified combination of option one or two, which I shared via email to each of you would be the best compromise for on page three. Table one Summary in Overview and Requirements.'",

I'd like to thank the staff for their work on the short term rental ordinance and to support their recommendation for option two with specific modifications for Long Beach. We've heard a lot this evening about community character specifically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A couple speakers ago, Maples Island. There's a perverse incentive if you don't have for all these folks who want to make ends meet and rent out their homes to have. Owners not on site and multiple properties and often entire multi-family residential buildings rented out as a workaround to just renting them out as hotels or other short term'",
        "'speaker_3': 'rental options that actually do pay the transit oriented tax. Transit the total. Limiting the rentals to the primary residence, as well as including platform accountability, the ability to actually get the data from Airbnb over who's abusing the system and putting the onus on them to provide enforcement rather than the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having to chase stories or chase police reports is probably a much more effective option. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You folks. My name is Nathan Gordon with the local 11. Quick story. A few years ago, I was able to rent an apartment in this building on Broadway in Linden. It's called the Old Broadland Hotel, built in 1902.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was converted to apartments. Back then, the rent was $700. A few years later, when I returned to the country in 2015, it was 1400 dollars. Now this same building is list all pretty much all the units on Airbnb for 99 tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's almost 2000 dollars for each unit you could make. What motivation does he have to rent it out to locals when he can just make all his money on Airbnb? Anyway. My point is that the Council should direct staff to draft an ordinance which includes platform accountability and primary residency posting.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name's Danielle Wilson. I'm here with the Unite Here Local 11. I've seen short term rentals decimate the housing stock in L.A. and other California cities where we are in a housing crisis. I've seen entire apartment buildings and multifamily buildings, like the gentleman said earlier, turned into de facto hotels in Los Angeles, Venice, Santa monica and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'here in Long Beach. Most notably about this phenomenon is the fact that it is already illegal. So I say that to say that the proliferation of stars in this way is largely a problem of enforcement, for one, and an inaccurate portrayal of the majority of our host to address enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city of Santa monica, where over 60% of illegal units have been taken off the market, has recognized how challenging it is for cities to ensure that short term rentals are regulated in a way that actually protects our housing and our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is known as platform accountability, where the burden of enforcement is on the platforms, not on staff who are already inundated with complaints and other code enforcement issues. For every listing found on the platform's website that is not registered with the city, the platforms should be required to pay a fine for one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The platform should also be required to share data with the city because, like Santa monica and other cities have found, it is very difficult to get the platforms to comply when the city is trying to investigate, investigate a complaint.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as the majority of stars in the city of Long Beach are on hosted, this is the case all over the place. If you want to run out your bedroom, we're fine with that. But if you want to take a valuable housing unit off the market, that is irresponsible and the city should not come forward tonight if'",

        "'speaker_2': 'different people and there didn't seem to be any control over having late parties. After 10:00 at night, the night the noise was still going on, there'd be young women and men together out in front. And it was a constant noise and worry because when you get home, you didn't know where you could park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My husband and I are both handicapped and we need to be able to park close to getting into our house. And you couldn't do that. I really hope that you would think about option three, that that would have more restrictions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that we were told that an area could be actually cut out and left without having that rental. So please think about that for us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you very much. Next.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, hello. My name is Al Farmer. I'm here with my union Unite Here, Local 11. I'd just like to echo what that last speaker said in terms of having carve out areas. Maybe instead, the city should consider exempting everywhere and letting communities opt in to having short term rentals in their in their neighborhoods before actually allowing these'",
        "'speaker_12': 'party houses and commercial businesses to take over whole apartment buildings. So obviously, owners who who make money on Airbnb do not want to be regulated. They they live in a current state where they they are not being heavily regulated by the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They don't want any regulation. Airbnb obviously does not want any regulation because it is a corporate middleman. It is not here to benefit the community of Long Beach. It is not here to benefit the people who clean those places or the people who stay in them.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the benefit it gives to the people who rent them out isn't actually Airbnb's intention. Their intention is to make profit off of those folks, and to some extent they're being taken advantage of because they're harming their city by reducing the housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That is why we need platform accountability to keep track of what is going on on places like Airbnb and VRBO. And it is why this council needs to include those things in in this short term rental rental regulation legislation, or it needs to hold this vote until these issues can be more properly studied.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If you have 1% of half, half or 1% on Airbnb and you only have a 3% vacancy rate, that's, you know, 40% of your available housing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm Jonah Breslau. I'm also here at Unite here Local 11. And, you know, one of the things that's really stuck out to me is that a lot of the folks speaking are homeowners. And that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wonderful. But this is a city of renters.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I myself am a renter. And I think that as the last speaker mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the things that's really important is the housing market. There is a housing crisis going on.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And when you have a 3% vacancy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rate, it is very serious to have more than a thousand units off the market. So again, I just want to say that we need a legislation that we can actually enforce to make sure that there's affordable housing. We need primary residence requirements to make sure that people are actually using this as home sharing and not to run'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hotels out of their homes. And we need platform accountability so that it's possible to actually enforce this ordinance. I mean, I'm just listening to this 25% rule. How would someone even file a complaint about whether or not more than 25% of the units in their building are being used for Airbnb?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That seems very complicated to determine if that's being violated. But the primary residence requirement is simple. It's clear it's enforceable, especially if you have the platform accountability provision. So if those can't be put into this, I think that the, you know, city council should thank you, sign and hear from more renters and neighbors of these Airbnb properties'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Thank you. Good evening, counsel. My name is Jordan. I'm with you. Not here. Local 11. One of the great things about Long Beach has always been its affordability and accessibility to all residents. However, with the housing crisis that it hit all of Southern California, it's vital that we pass a real short.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Term rental regulation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Given the shortage of housing, in particular affordable housing. We don't need short term rentals taking long term housing off the market, housing that can go to long term residents. In my opinion, long term residents are not long term problems, as was said earlier by one of the speakers there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long there are Long Beach residents that create long term community hosts should be limited to one unit so that we don't take more units off the market and we need platform accountabilities that this law can actually be enforced.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you're not ready to include these sensible solutions, I believe you should postpones that. You have time to really look more into these issues with care. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Christine Miller. I'm a former.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Hotel worker and organizer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With Local.'",
        "'speaker_11': '11. I urge the council to pass an ordinance that holds short term rentals accountable to the city, regulates their usage, and requires sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Community benefits through proper oversight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Of the crucial TOT. The City of Long Beach has the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To create strong and thorough legislation that protects.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our quality of life while creating a much needed and potentially robust source of revenue for the city. I believe this legislation should include a host be limited to one unit that is their primary residence so that we don't see the proliferation of unregulated hotels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is also crucial.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To include platform accountability. If you are not prepared to include these items tonight, we strongly encourage you to postpone the vote because we believe you really need enough time to look into these matters thoroughly and with care. I urge you to take this responsibility seriously.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I am I live in the fifth District. And I just one of the things is, is that, um, what if basically everybody's covered all these points that I wanted to make and I do host Airbnb and I just wanted to remind that that we do bring money in because like you said, that that $10,000 that comes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in, that money is, is been is, is very spent back into the community. So that we do have that. Sorry. But we do have the ability to invest in our community and we also invest in our houses we invest in and we spend the money to do other things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the other thing I wanted to just to reiterate was that, you know, the people who come to stay at my house, they're doing things locally. They go to Cal State, Long Beach for conferences or they have to do things around around my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So and those people need to have the housing so that they can have something that's affordable to them, because most of the time they're not working for corporations who are sending them on a business trip. They're doing it for themselves and they need to find ways to save money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you. Good evening, Hawkeye Rivero with Libra. I'm just struck by sort of like what we're actually.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Talking about and then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just just keeping in mind that the city is currently trying to tackle the homelessness crisis, which has to do with housing availability, and yet we're here considering actually taking units off the market. Does it make any sense to me how is the city going to tackle homelessness and still allow for non hosted units to be taken off'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the market? It almost seems like a contradiction, so I don't know how we're going to deal with that. And with the housing crisis as it is low vacancy rates and we don't have any tenant protections, we don't have any money for affordable housing development or any significant affordable housing development projects.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How are we replacing the units that we're currently taking off the market? By allowing these stores that are non hosted when we're not, we don't have any plan in place to replace them. And yet we're in a housing crisis and we're we we're willing for these units to actually be taken away from long term renters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And do we not care about stability of our communities? Because studies have shown time after time that community stability is is integral in a healthy community, in a safer community, in a more economically viable community. And yet we have hosts here coming up saying that long term renters are no good, that they prefer short term renters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So basically saying we like unstable communities and that's what we're going to line our pockets with. And I think that that's something that you all need to consider. We need sensible regulations that keep the regulations to host it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And people's primary residence. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, councilmembers and Mayor. My name is Catherine Chappell. I'm an Airbnb super host in District six. I am in support of Option one as a best serves the range of hosts that are in this community and is the least restrictive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I ran one room in an owner occupied home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Currently, the money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I make from Airbnb is split between home improvement and funding a college education. Being an Airbnb host has increased the value of my home through these improvements. In addition, local businesses gain from customers through the recommendations that I make to guests far into the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I like to imagine the potential for income that I could earn as an Airbnb host when I retire.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that actually might be the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Most important part for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Me is income that I could earn when I'm no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Longer getting a routine paycheck. I experience as a host a loud neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With barking dogs, fighting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Couples, dirty alleyways tied with graffiti. I'm doing my part to make my place as beautiful as I can and in it, and an inviting space that is a safe feeling as possible. I like having a short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've had a bad experience with long term rental. I'm talking teased on the front lawn and cops called twice, so I will never rent to somebody again. I like having a short term rental for that purpose, and I also like having a space available for a guest room ready for them to come into.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Family comes to visit me all the time.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Kevin Yeager. I'm a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and a resident of District two. I'm here to urge the City Council to restrict staffers to only primary residences, no unhosted units. In previous city council meetings, when we've come here to ask for rent control or tenant protections, we've always had the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'conversation redirected towards housing supply. We don't need limits on rent increases or unjust evictions. We just need to build more housing. And while increasing our housing supply is not enough to address this current crisis, it's absolutely a start.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's why we can't allow Unhosted Airbnb units to remove rental units from our already strained market. These Unhosted units would otherwise be rental units. Instead, they're operating as effectively illegal hotels. And there's really a discrepancy we're seeing where developers come in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They might build 500 units in downtown Long Beach with 3% in the affordable range. And then meanwhile, on the back end, we're allowing multi-unit buildings to give up to 25% of their rental stock to tourism. So this is just not a sustainable model for our rental supply.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to resist this commodification of our community and put regulations in place to protect what little rental stock we have. Thank you. My name is Gerald Anderson and I am a resident of Naples. We have each have a copy of the petition that a group of us circulated in Naples.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in circulating it, we, we talked to the people who live next door to and in this disease as these stars and the people who are nearby, those at least in Naples, really feel strongly against against this this practice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we we were able to get over a thousand signatures so far, and we were still getting more from. And that represents about 800 over 850 residences at different addresses in Naples. So we I urge you to accept, accept, pass.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Option three and also option R petition did not designate and hosted. Reynolds Only it was was just general that we want the practice of stars stopped in Naples. So I think you should cover those and you should also consider covering other things by petition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's a very good practice. So I urge you to accept our petition and.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'To thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sir. Option three. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Holly and Anderson seven reveal also Canal Naples. We respectfully urge you to support the Naples position petition are only over 1000 signatures. To prohibit short term rentals in Naples. We are zoned in R.A. one for a reason. We are exactly three feet away from each other in that small community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have no backyards, we have postage stamp front yards, and trust me, our houses back up to each other. If we have our kitchen doors open together, the neighbor and us have our living room doors open. You can hear everything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our bedroom, our master bedroom looks right down on their deck. So our concern for a stranger is going in and out 8 to 10 strangers every two or three days because of safety and security concerns. There is also a liability for the city from from the water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our homes are actually 12 to 15 feet from the water and the seawalls. There are a mere 18 inches for small children to climb up on the seawall and to go over into the water. Renters would be more careless with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We bought our houses to live in many years ago as a family community. And most people we think if there were thank you, thank you must not buy a house next to a commercial enterprise like the many hotels.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Thank you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Leaving councilmembers. Mr. Mayor, Victor Sanchez of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and a Healthy Community. We really want to kind of try and bring this home. This is this is about the housing crisis. And we're talking about short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They play a part in the housing crisis. And so what we're trying to advocate for is none of the options. Actually, it's an alternative option, one that focuses on platform accountability and primary residence as a requirement. The on the accountability piece, look, they will cut you a check for Toyota.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You will get them needed revenue to fund vital city services and to continue right in that respect. But on the enforcement mechanism, you can create a registry, but without the necessary provisions in an ordinance to mandate that the platforms themselves share the data and the information so that you can cross-reference and actually hold the platforms accountable for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the unregistered or unlicensed bookings that are potentially on there. You're going to be spending a lot of money on the back end as a city to try and recoup that later down the road. On the primary residence situation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Look, there's a fine line between speculation and supplemental income. And what we're trying to avoid here is for folks who own multiple homes to take away long term resident units that would otherwise go to long term resident families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we can go and say that, oh, it's a small part of the housing stock. It's less than 1%. But in the housing crisis where you have such a low vacancy rate, right, every unit matters. And so we're imploring you to really pay attention to those two things as you decide and continue having this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Just 1/2 and we're going to close the speakers list if there's a last person speaking. Anyone else? Okay. We're closing right there. The young man with the loudspeaker. Thank you. You can come up, sir.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi. Good evening. My name is a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Shy and I am a super host with Airbnb. I live in District six. I have a little bit of stage fright, so bear with me. I own two units in District six. I do whole home rentals. I don't do a shared bedroom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't do any of that stuff. And that's because among Airbnb hosts, we're all different.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, everybody has different needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I could go out and say, Hey, I want some income property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And let's buy some long term rentals. Well, the thing is, you have bad long term rentals, just as you have bad short term rentals. But the problem here is that I think a lot of people are coming up to date that have had bad experiences with short term rentals, and they're trying to make that the norm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's not my experience. I have adequate parking for all my guests. I've been a host for three years. I don't have any noise complaints. I manage my property very well. Now I'm an option. I'm in favor of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Option one just because people should be allowed to do what they want. I feel to the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Major degree, with a hard home when I travel, I have a need for short term rentals. If I move with my family of seven for a one week stay in some city, I can go to a hotel for that, you know, drinks of time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Neither can I do a long term rental. A short term rental. That's what I need this it need for that and we just need to regulate it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's good evening. My name is Tamara Swagger. I'm a resident of District seven. My husband and I moved to Long Beach from SEAL Beach four years ago. We bought a seven bedroom, seven bath fixer upper that had been bank owned for about 11 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we've spent the last four years remodeling it. Two of the rooms in our home are operated as Airbnb units are both Airbnb plus we are in our home full time. My husband has a full time job, as do I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also have two long term rentals that we will keep long term rentals. We have no intention of converting them to short term. We have found it to be a really positive experience for both my husband, myself and my son, who is ten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And since we moved to Long Beach, we have a daughter who's two. Some of our guests, you've heard a lot of people tonight talk about they have had traveling nurses, people who are tourists. We had the opportunity to host two people who were negotiating their leases to become tenants at Steele Craft, which is a development in Bixby'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Knolls. And and since then, both have purchased homes in the Long Beach area. I am a strong supporter of the sharing economy. I do think that it self regulates, whether it's Airbnb or Turo or Lyft or Uber, and I think that regulation is good and something that should be considered and enforced because it legitimizes the platform in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my opinion. I think that the study that was done was thorough and I would urge you to move forward with the recommendation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. My name is Sam Grippo from Belmont Shores. First, I like to say that thank you for doing the workshops. It was much appreciated and I support Option one and the only thing I don't believe in is the putting in the liability platform there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second is, I believe in short term rentals and long term rentals. And as far as long term rentals, I live where I live and I have some long term, Reynolds said, that are pretty much partying all the time and there's nothing I can do about it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't even have a 24 hour calling number for long term rentals, and I think that should be an issue to who. If you're going to do it to short term rentals, you should provide it for long term rentals to now and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The thing I have is that I am I believe in the economy. I believe in free market. Now, what would be great if we can just make sure that everything is fair and that we make sure that people understand that people own their properties, they have the right to do what they can do with it, but not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to make it so terrible that you have to use option three where people are just not able to do anything. And this is great for the economy. This is great for Long Beach sales tax. t0t it just brings a great economic situation for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks so much, Councilwoman Mango. Actually, now I'm sorry. Please come forward. It's a. No, I have two more speakers. I'm sorry about that. Please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, well, good evening. There's more speakers. My name is Nerida, and I am a super worker and a super resident. Uh oh. Oh, sorry. It's been a long night. I've been at work here. Anyways, as a worker and as a resident of this city, I strongly encourage Long Beach City Council to do the right thing in order'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to ensure for us to work and live in Long Beach. We need a we need to continue with an ordinance for short term rental that will not threaten our ability to do so. It is your job as elected officials to protect our jobs by continuing to encourage the economic development of Long Beach Union Hotels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Allowing short term rental platforms to enter our city without any regulations would seriously harm our jobs and our industry. Thus, Long Beach City Council must follow the footsteps of Santa monica and approve that ordinance that hold short term rental platforms accountable in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our community is not burdened. Some longshoreman long term rentals are not burdened. Some residents are not burdened. Some we are Long Beach. We are community this. We are what makes Long Beach great. And if we don't have that, where where are we to live?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I just strongly encourage Long Beach City Council to do the right thing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. My name is Mauricio, and this is my daughter, Aubrey. I'm a minimum wage worker. I take her to school in the morning. I go to work and I get out of work. I pick her up and then we go to my second job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I work all day from eight in the morning till 11 at night. So she's there with me at work and work. And I just barely make the the train, which is 1500 here in downtown Long Beach. And just two weeks ago, two weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The businesses that I work with worked for, they shut down so I don't have a job anymore. And Airbnb has helped me pay the rent and now I can spend time with her. She's improving reading at her school.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I read to her every day her ABCs, her numbers and everything. Airbnb has gave me a second chance to pay my bills, the rent, and spend more time with her. So all we ask from you is help. And we're good citizens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We pay taxes. And her name is Aubrey, and I'm a single parent. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And thank you for coming to. Let me go ahead and sorry. It's not Councilwoman Mongeau. There is a motion in a second on the floor. So let me and I know there's going to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just hope people also can just bear with us here. There's questions and there's I know the staff has got I know a lot of information as well. So want to make sure I've got the chance to to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before we begin comes when Councilor Pierce, I got a note from staff that you wanted to clarify something in the staff report just to make it clear.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. First of all, that was a lot of great input, and I'm sure that'll be a part of the discussion at the council dais. But two things that I did want to point out for the audience that was not quite clear in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The first is option one versus option two is there are some differences and we went through those. But if you're a host who is living in your unit, there is no difference between option one and option two. So if you if the council wants to ask more questions about that, we can certainly get into that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I did want to point that out. We heard a lot of people who live in their homes who are renting it out. There is no difference between option one and option to for them. The second is we heard a lot of input about the TOTY, about what the level of the TOTTY should be, whether we should'",
        "'speaker_12': 'exempt short term rentals when it should be higher or lower. I just wanted to point out that the city council, this body does not have the ability to exempt anyone from the TOTY. They can't increase the vote, they can't lower the totty that's set by the voters at 12%, and it would apply to short term rentals and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'could only be changed by the voters. And so with that, we're prepared to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me turn this over to Councilor Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Well, thank you. All of you. Plus, I think public comments that we had and I know that our staff has done a great job of listening and taking an input for the last year. And so I just want to thank everybody for going along this process with us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I wanna remind us at the beginning of this process actually was not in the housing report. It was when this item was agenda was by the council. And the item is agenda is by the council to really try to tackle two things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One is to understand the impact of units on our housing stock, given that we are about 4% housing vacancy and to create a revenue stream to support protecting affordable housing. Two was to regulate home share short term rentals in a way that enriches the lives, invites alternative modes of tourism or regulating the quality of life, and providing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for a revenue stream to monitor as towers, which we currently do not have. And so I want to recognize those that open up their homes are adding to the fabric of this community. I want to recognize those that are struggling to pay their rent are also adding to the fabric of this community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so this item, listening to the public comments and I. There are so many people that said option one, two and three. And there are things that I agree with all of them. And so I really have spent the last couple of weeks since we've had the staff report out really trying to dissect, not just looking at'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the staff report as one, two and three, but as a policymaker. I spent a, you know, a decade at a nonprofit that did policy work, really trying to take it seriously and craft a policy that that will be good for Long Beach overall.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, no, no, that going into this that this is a very complex policy and it's not done willy nilly. And so with that comment, you know, there are a lot of questions that we have about the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are several opportunities where we do not have a lot of information yet. And so I think it's important that today that our council give some direction as to what we'd like to see in the short term rental world, but also give us some opportunities to hear back from staff and in some of these situations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm going to go through all of them, but I just wanted to kind of put the context that I don't expect us to, by the end of today, have an ordinance that we are all 100% on board with, that the city attorneys on board with that staff is on board with because this is a really complex'",
        "'speaker_6': 'issue. And it is the first time that we as a council have heard this issue as a body. So typically we might have a study session ahead of time and then give some direction to staff to come back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so bear with us with the process knowing that that hasn't quite happened yet. And this is our first time as a body talking about this in over a year. So with that, I wanted to make a couple comments from the data that was shared.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Things that stuck out for me were that 84% of the sharing or people sharing an entire listing, that the average age is 44 people, you know, in their careers, maybe career changing, trying to supplement the majority. Almost 60% of them are women who are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we know, women are often paid less and are still struggling to equal that same amount going down. See, I have several notes I'm trying to be mindful of. I'm going to start at the beginning. And if you look at the staff report, they have divided it up into several sections.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'm going to ask some questions of staff and then hear from my council colleagues and go from there with the. House parties. I know that there is a muni code chapter out there. Can staff just clarify for us what's happening in the city versus what we're trying to say in this staff report around short term'",
        "'speaker_6': 'rentals and where we might rectify that in the future?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Currently.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Any residential use or any other use that creates a noise that is in excess of what the noise ordinance allows. It can be investigated, incited if they are found to be in violation. I think what we were looking for here is based upon the feedback that we heard through our community outreach efforts, is that short term rentals'",
        "'speaker_11': 'in particular sometimes created noise impacts that may necessarily be over and above what you might experience in a regular residential neighborhood setting. So we wanted to put into place some protections that put a little bit more regulation around the short term rentals, because we did have the concern about making sure we protect the character of the residential'",
        "'speaker_11': 'area and minimize any potential impacts. And so the noise issue that we laid in place was in addition to making sure that the renters or the guests would be made aware of all of the regulations around the rental of the unit, including the noise issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the other consideration regarding noise was just the number of persons that were in the unit. So in addition to restricting the number of occupants in the unit, the intent was to just make sure that activities were not occurring during the rental of the property that might result in excessive noise.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's that's the gist of how we came up with the regulations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then the limiting to ten people per household was a number that we based off of just wanting to lower the amount of people for noise or is there specific reason.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was noise was one of the factors there. But the other factor is generally the fact that you we wanted to make sure that the size of the unit was or the number of bedrooms in the space in the unit was commensurate with the number of people that were residing in them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's a I would say broadly, it's just kind of a safety issue that you don't want to have an overcrowded unit that we think contributes to deterioration of the unit and other negative impacts to the unit as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. It's Mike.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Parking. And I know that we talked about parking earlier and the parking is not something that we feel we can regulate because of the land use. Correct. So that is not something that that staff is recommending. I'm trying to get the the light easy things out of the way before we talk about the big thing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So bear with me so I can do this slowly. For house parties, what I would like to see if council is open to is having staff come back where we address the existing policy and look at something simple, like having the number of special permits for big events.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that we're not saying you're not allowed to host anything. So like I'm staying in a short term rental over Christmas, I'm having a Christmas party. I need to go get a permit for that instead of banning it completely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that we can talk as a council about what we think is a reasonable number for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just to go back up to the top. So on option two. So if I based off of option two, I support option two. And I know that there's some things that are that are challenging with it. And so one of the the things that stuck out to me was the number of units being up to six stars'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or 25% of a total unit. And so walk us through what that looks like for, I mean, my district, the majority of the units say their ten unit buildings. And then I have on down in downtown, I have a 400 building unit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one of the options we discussed was making it 10% across the board for any unit and not having a specific number like six. That's something that we can do that staff would recommend moving forward with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. We would actually like to recommend a sliding scale.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That under 50 it would be 25%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With a max of six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Units, a development with 51 to 115% or a max of eight and then plus 10%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With a max of ten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I want to hear what my council colleagues have to say just on that. I talked to staff, I talked to the city attorney. I talked to Tom a little bit today. And so I think what is more comfortable for me versus this kind of piecemeal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Up to two stars or three if this in 25 year six there is that we would get to a place where we would say 1% of our housing stock across the board and that if we had 10% of every unit that way, we're not having units that have six or only have two whenever they actually might have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a bigger capacity. So one of my challenges is my downtown residence. There is a very large percent of my downtown residents that live here half the time and live in Florida half the time. And so I don't want to limit the number in those areas where they have a bigger capacity for them versus a lower income building'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that I might have closer to the Alamitos Beach area. And so this, folks, is why this is challenging today, because we are literally this is a massive policy. And so I want to not ask for you guys to vote for those things today, but give us some direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If those are our requests, come back with how we would implement those. Because I know that this is going to be too much for council colleagues to really dissect each little piece. So does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I think we might be able to dissect. Okay, but let's try it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm getting some very eyebrows. So I just wanted to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I just want to make sure. I just want to make sure. Just to clarify, I mean, maybe we can do that. You wanted the clarification at the end.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Clarify.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the 1% issue makes sense to most folks. I think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That of the sliding or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Changing a sliding scale to a percentage, which does not have very much. Practical, immediate effect. I don't think what we currently have is Mr. Motor.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So as we understand, those are two related but a little bit different issues. So as we understand there's a concept of saying we would put an ultimate limit on the number of stores in the city at 1% of the housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That would be to prevent owed, you know, too many conversions over time that this becomes kind of a runaway ordinance and you start going to two to 3 to 4%. So that's one issue. Staff would be very supportive of that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We can bring that back as part of the of the ordinance. The other is the issue of and I think it was appropriately brought up that there are some small buildings, but then there's also some very large buildings.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so we could do a sliding scale, as was mentioned by by Lisa, to try to to equitably distribute among those larger buildings that, you know, a larger building could have a little bit more without having as much impact.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It could be 10% across the board. That really is a policy issue from the council. We recommended the 25% or six, whichever is lower. It could be 25 or six, whichever is higher, it could be 10% or a sliding scale.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we're looking for some direction on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you could bring those options back also. But I, I, I understand what the councilman saying there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We could ideally what we would like to do is get some direction tonight on some basic framework for the street and come back with an ordinance. We can also you can also ask us to maybe pick one, come back in the ordinance, and then we could also come back with options, you know, you know, just to talk'",
        "'speaker_12': 'about it. But rather than we're trying to avoid bringing back three or four different ordinances, we'd want to bring back one ordinance. But if you want us to research aspects, we can do that too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, there's just so many options here that I want to make sure that we as a council, all of us, I know that I've been paying close attention to this, but that we all are understanding the impacts of it when we see.'",
        "'speaker_6': '10%, 1% safety and liability. 10%. So on enforcement. One of the conversations that I've had both with the platform Airbnb and note, that's the only platform that's reached out or engaged with us at all. And that I've had with some other folks is the idea of a third party verification.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I know when we talked about how we would verify and what that process looks like, there's still a lot of questions that staff has. So this again, is another piece of this that I feel like is not fleshed out and ready for primetime, per se.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would like to ask that staff take the next hundred and 20 days or sooner if they can get it done sooner to meet with at least three platforms. And a third party like Vertu fi group. There's other groups out there to talk about how we can make sure that the is getting the information that we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'need. Not too much information. Not information that's going to result with a lawsuit, but basic information that's going to allow us to regulate this industry and collect the right amount of top end and fees that are required. So that was one piece out of this that I didn't feel really comfortable with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I don't necessarily think that we have to go down the same path that other cities have gone. If we have an opportunity now to go with one of these newer routes. On the fines. I know that that staff had made some recommendation on fines.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the things that was brought up, I think, if we're talking about a lot of these hosts are people that live in their buildings. The outreach for this, you know, I'm not really clear on how how thorough that's going to be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one of the options I wanted to propose to my council colleagues was that the first instance actually be a warning instead of a $500 fine and that they have 30 days to register and apply for a business license, that the second violation be $1,000, the next violation would be 15, and the third violation would be 2000'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and the registration would be revoked. Following with the the remaining recommendations that staff has on that process. But really, the main thing is that that first one is not a fine, but it's a fix, that warning.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So just for clarification, it would go from a three fine to a four fine. You get one warning, then it would go to 1000 for the first warnings that your first fine. Second fine would be 1500 third fine would be 2000.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On the ACR registration, I know that one of the biggest challenges is making sure that it is a simple process and that hosts are actually going on and registering. So I know that staff has not made some recommendations that costs would be that that is our cost recovery fee and I wanted to go on record was saying'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it should be as low as a fee as possible so we can make sure we get more people registering on the platform than not and that that process be a simplified process. Someone just go on record with that and hope that when this item comes back that you guys have fleshed out what those numbers look'",
        "'speaker_6': 'like and what we can actually do. I know, tier two we address. That's one of the things we talked about with Toti and it was brought up in the audience today is that hotels get a benefit whenever they pay into Toti, they get advertising.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I know staff will work closely with Steve Goodling and with our tourism, our CVB board to say that on the same website that says here we have, you know, the Hyatt and the Westin, that there's a platform link that says here's an Airbnb or whatever other links there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the hosts feel like they're getting something for their investment.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I do want to point out that the Convention Visitors Bureau is really seeing a change in the convention business in the last couple of years. So there is conventions that really their members want to do short term rentals instead of stay in hotels.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So, you know, the convention center is is embracing that. There are people who like hotels, there's people who like stars. And so they're really embracing that whoever wants to stay because they're all coming to Long Beach to spend money.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So they would certainly embrace that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, and that's you know, I think that that is the hard part of the discussion today. And so I just want to address that because I haven't addressed it yet. I know that, you know, the hotel workers are seeing this as a as a challenge and that there's one is affordability.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One is the challenge with the hotels. And I mean, I'm somebody that travels a lot. There's many times I want to stay in a hotel and there are times I want to stay in a short term rental. You know, they offer different things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So hosting a Christmas dinner, that's my short term rental, not doing that at a hotel. And I know that our hotel and tourism market is strong. I feel comfortable that it is going to continue to thrive. We've got, you know, six projects in the works right now looking at downtown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'm really, really trying to be mindful about creating a positive policy that is not going to overburden us with excess of staffers, but is going to be mindful of those homeowners that are already doing this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I want to be mindful of that. And just to to reference that. So to be clear, for next steps, I think, as I mentioned, that this isn't fully fleshed out, that that there's a lot of information that we do not have as a council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so when you do come back, just making sure that we come back with the enforcement piece, that we have a staff report and recommendations from you guys on the registration fees and the business licenses. And so that was one other thing with the business licenses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I wanted to ask if there was a way for us to not require a business license for hosts that rent less than 30 days. And I think that our city attorney might have had some challenges with that. So if you could elaborate on that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Councilwoman Pierce. That's one of the things that we're looking at right now. Currently, the way the business license taxes is structured for these types of short term rentals, there's actually an exemption built in the tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Fewer than four units. So we would have to look to see if we could even impose a business license tax for 1 to 3 units at this point because those taxes were adopted by a vote of the people.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's one of the things we're looking at. It doesn't mean you couldn't charge fees necessarily, but it wouldn't be part of the business license tax.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So that that goes back to my point of making sure that when this item comes back, the only way that I'm able to support having up to 1% short term rentals is that we're creating some fees and some funding that has a nexus tied to affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if this comes back and the staff report comes back and says, we can't do fees, we can't do these registration, then I'm going to I'm going to be in a challenging spot. So I just wanted to make sure that that was really clear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I hope that we can find some avenue to support our affordable housing. So in the report, you guys talk about inclusionary housing. And I know right now we've just brought on our our consultant. They're out doing community engagement around inclusionary housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you talk about one more time what the the nexus in between regulating our short term rentals and affordable housing might be?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We know that there is some limited nexus and that's the purpose of doing the study so that we can more fully establish that relationship. We feel that the short term that there is some opportunity to create a a some level of funding for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we really will rely on a study to determine what that level should be. And that, of course, would be in conjunction with looking at the cost recovery to put in place the the staff efforts in the implementation of the program overall.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it would really be balancing the amount that is going to cost recovery. The amount that would be left over would be something that we could consider for affordable housing. We just need to have a study to determine what those amounts are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And when you do that study and look at those amounts, I know that we looked at inclusionary housing. I also would like to ask staff to maybe explore if there's some nexus with period to maintain existing housing so it doesn't get taken off the market.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just to make sure we're looking at any options in case the funding isn't a big enough number to have a real impact on on developing new housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think I mentioned earlier that it's pretty clearly spelled out in the options that were laid out for you that no currently dedicated and covenanted affordable housing would be eligible for a short term rental. So none of those would be taken off the out of the interest.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I understand. So with that for the vote today, if we vote and we make some of these changes or give a little bit better direction to staff, and we haven't figured out that enforcement mechanism yet. What happens next?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So just walk us through. We vote today. Everything that city staff will do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, essentially what we would start with is taking the items that come out of the council's motion and we would tackle them one by one. We do the fee assessment to determine what the registration fee for short term rentals, what an appropriate fee would be.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I literally your request about special events. We would work with the city attorney's office to determine what mechanism makes that practical or feasible. We did ask specifically that you give us direction. You said you're not sure what the number would be, but what we would do is just look at the feasibility of implementing something and you'",
        "'speaker_11': 'could later on determine what the number of days that would be appropriate. And again, we would literally go down your list of items or the items that come out of the council motion, and we would address them one by one.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It may be that we don't come back directly with an ordinance. Maybe we provide a24 from or something that could elaborate and give some of the preliminary responses that we found and get further direction. So all of those are possible ways that we could address it and bring you back something that is really responsive to the council'",
        "'speaker_11': 'direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's great. So we wouldn't start collecting any totty or anything until this council gives a direction with an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to clarify that for for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, actually, that's a little bit different than what the staff recommendation currently is. So we are asking for authorization to enter into the contract to start collecting those based on what is there today. So we had held off on that for a long time while we went through this policy process over a year and a half.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We did put a small amount of money into the FOIA 19 budget, and so the staff recommendation tonight is to start collecting that total. We can certainly wait, but then that would have some financial impact. So I want to make that clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me let me clarify one thing also, because I think it's important. So the council voted as a body to include revenues from Airbnb as we balanced the budget in this last cycle. And so I just want to make sure that one that we're aware that that is something that is being expected through the general fund at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the same time. There I think there is there's interest, which I support, which I support. And having a discussion about how as the ordinance comes back, how and if we should be dedicating some of those funds and how those are dedicated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think that's a conversation we should have and and I support. But mindful of the fact that we already made the decision to include some of those funds that are going to be coming in for other general fund purposes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Fire engines can't spend the money. We don't have it yet. So I think that, you know, in the very beginning, I wanted to make sure that we weren't collecting money before we regulated. And I had that very honest conversation with the platforms as well from the very beginning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't want to get us into not wanting to regulate too much because we've got some money already. I'm going to stop there. I think I've said a lot and I want to hear where the council colleagues are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But, you know, I think a fine balance in between protecting our rental market and ensuring that we are able to have a tie to that market is going to be key. So what's going to be important for me again, is really understanding the nexus with the affordable housing, where those funds could go and how we're going to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'use those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Notes on Pearce before we move forward. I know you didn't phrase that necessarily in the form of a motion, although it's on the monitor. Was that meant to be a motion basically for staff to begin preparing an ordinance that we will bring back, that incorporate the items that you talked about and possibly more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With friendly amendments?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would honestly, because the way that this has been presented, it's been a little bit difficult to have a full conversation, I think. So I like the Linda Tatum's, you know, put an end to from for let us make sure that we have that data and then come back with an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be be the process I would prefer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to I just want to caution us that let's I think actually, Councilwoman, that we are on our way pretty I think your comments were fine. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They should they should a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Draft an ordinance. But I think we need to see some information before that ordinance comes back to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's you know, that certainly can be expected. I just want to make sure that we are coming out of here with some direction about where we need to go. Yes. So, yes, I think so. I think then that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That helps out. So we read all the things you just said as your motion. So to adopt kind of the staff recommendations option to with the following changes that we talked about. And if I need to read them, I can read them for the for the body later.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we have those written down. So we would understand that to be a motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, let's keep going to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Prepare a draft ordinance and bring information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Back. And there's still might be conversations about the ordinance itself. Let's let's keep let's keep going. So we have a we have a base. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. May. And thank you to staff for your excellent presentation and the great work that you've put into this over the last over one year. I really appreciate the engagement. I appreciate the inclusion from every council district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I want to thank my residents who have come out to community meetings, ones that I've hosted in ones that the city have hosted, who have provided petitions, who have provided us with comments and been very engaged in this topic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm very appreciative of that input. Personally, I do want to hear from my colleagues, but personally I'd like to move forward with an ordinance motion tonight, certainly something that we can tweak when it comes back for first reading.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I think that asking my I mean, I have residents here who've been here all night. It's late and expecting them to come back for a another meeting to, you know, talk about these issues a lot, again, is just really a lot to ask.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'd like us to at least have some direction on where we're headed tonight. And I know Councilwoman Pierce has put a lot of work into this, and I appreciate her collaboration as well on this. I agree with all of her recommendations as to option two.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And one of the things that she and I talked about and I know she didn't mention really tonight, but I want to highlight is I know I appreciate that that staff put them into different options for us because it was for the ease of discussion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I think as you'll find, there will be things that we liked about one or the other that we want to mix around. So I don't I want to understand that the option to is not going to look much like your option.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Once we're done with it tonight, probably. So one of the things so I have a couple of questions before I share some of my thoughts on this. In regards to the option three, which is really option two with the additional provision that it would allow communities, small sex sections or communities, however they're geographically defined, to be able'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to petition similar like we do with parking preferred preferential parking districts with two thirds vote to be able to limit the short term rentals in those communities. So my understanding is we cannot those communities, even with two thirds vote, could not prohibit hosted testers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that correct? That is correct. They would be prohibiting any unhosted short term rentals. Okay. And that's because we have access priorities with the coastal areas and things of that nature. That is correct. Okay. I will say I've heard from so many residents, both hosts, as well as residents who are neighbors to skiers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't I have not yet once seen an issue with a hosted short term rental where the resident, the owner is in the house and they're doing more of a home sharing type concept. That doesn't seem to be the issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The issue in terms of quality of life impacts tends to be when the entire house or property is rented. Unhosted. And so that's the the issue that I think neighborhoods would want to try to mitigate if they could.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The other question that I had is I want to hear staff's thoughts on the idea of requiring a business license if it's a hosted ACR and the homeowner or occupant is at the home during the rentals. Why would it be necessary for them to get a business license?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think what you heard us earlier just with the city attorney's response, is that we recognize that there is a something of a conflict now between our initial recommendation and realizing that currently long term rentals only require a business license if it's four or more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we think that it's an appropriate fix to go back and just make them equal. So if it's anything less than three units, then I think we would certainly be exploring not having a business license as a requirement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think maybe something else to think about when you come back with that is I think there's a real difference between Unhosted and hosted in terms of the business license. So so what I'm saying is that if it's a hosted and the person's in the home and renting out a room in the home, why would they'",
        "'speaker_11': 'need to get a business license if they're using it as a vacation rental and, you know, exclusively renting it out, then it is more of a business operation than just sharing their home.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So, Councilwoman Price, one reason that you might want to have them get a business license is for tracking purposes. Mm hmm. So that you can make sure that you're collecting the total for each of those. So the idea would be that they may get a business.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We may require them to get a business license, but not charge the business license tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For tracking purposes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I see. I see. So if there was a way to maybe call it a STR registration or something like that, as opposed to a business license that might be more appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think that's what some other cities have done. We could look at that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Um, you know, so one of the things that I would like, I'm going to make a friendly to the motion and I've talked with Councilman Pearce about it. I would like neighborhoods to have the option to limit or ban Unhosted stickers if they get sufficient signatures.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I would like the staff recommendation when it comes back. So that would be option three to some degree, even though we're now modifying option two. So it's kind of a blank slate at this point, but it would be whatever we agree on with option two, but allowing neighborhoods to opt out.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I think we need further clarification on what that geographic boundary would look like in terms of the neighborhoods. Certainly, we don't want to be we don't want to make the neighborhood so big that it's impossible to obtain two thirds of a vote.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we also don't want to make it too small. So that block by block, we have different regulations because that's very difficult. So I would like that to be included as an option of for staff to come back with a recommendation on what a reasonable geographic limitation would look like.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And again, it's only for Unhosted. So I don't know if that's a friendly that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You accept? Well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to hear from the city attorney, and then that's included as part of our back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, it's going to be an ordinance back, I think.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it would be helpful to get direction tonight if we don't get direction tonight specifically on that issue, we would definitely assuming that the friendly is accepted. We would bring back as part of the ordinance some form of geographic boundary with the justification for why we chose that particular geographic boundary and council after first reading, if the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'boundary we drew was too big or too small, you could certainly give us direction to go back. This is such a complex area. I mean, it would be great if we could get it passed on first reading. I'm not really anticipating that, so I'm sure we'll be making a couple of other tweaks and this could be one'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of them, but we'll bring back some boundary.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I address the friendly just quickly?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So I think I want to make sure that we are not taking a whole section of our city off the market, thus creating a pressure on, say, my district. So. So that's why I like to see what you guys come up with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would, you know, if it's a very small pocket versus a census tract, which tends to be a little bit larger. And I'd like to hear from my council colleagues. I also think there might be some comments down the road around 80 years and stuff like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd like to hear everybody's comments on what units they feel like are appropriate before we kind of say like, put this in stone in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so, as I understood Councilwoman prices friendly, it wouldn't take anything off the completely off the map. It would simply limit it to allow it to to be were it have to be a hosted facility. So they would in all areas of the city, there would be something or there possibility for something, but in some areas it'",
        "'speaker_12': 'might have to be hosted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this would be would you be talking about non primary or primary?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Primaries would always be allowed. It is the be unhosted that would not be allowed if we got the approval, the geographic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Approval to opt out. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I add this one thing? I know that we have a Councilwoman Pierce, so I think there is an opportunity because I view this this component of the ordinance important because I understand what you're saying. I do think there is probably a way of crafting that piece that Councilman Price is talking about in a way that could'",
        "'speaker_0': 'work. I mean, at the end of the day, we are this council is not going to be banning these stars in these neighborhoods because legally it's not an option. So I think the next question then becomes how how are you able to create a policy where you can have some neighborhood input on what happens?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but yet recognizing that we don't want it to be a situation where if a community is all homeowners and they can, you know, all us dealers can get banned, but then how do other communities do the same thing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think we can I think staff can find a some creative ideas or solutions and on getting us there because I think it's a concern that we had heard before was a complete ban. And I think what's what's being discussed now is not a ban.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's really trying to target the non hosted sites right that were there aren't local Long Beach homeowners but as we know, these are oftentimes some are local folks, but oftentimes they are purchased from other folks that are just renting out or Airbnb being their house from from afar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is there a way, Mike, as I'm actually interested in this component as well, is there a way of of coming up with some best practices on how we would do this option that Councilman Price and Pearce are talking about?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mayor, I think where we would start with best practices, we take a look in those coastal cities that have dealt with this issue already and see what the Coastal Commission has actually permitted those cities to do. And from the coastal cities that I've looked at so far that have gotten approval from the Coastal Commission, it seems to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'be a situation where they do allow cities to limit it to hosted only, and that seems to be best practice. Maybe council member Urunga has more information than that, but I think that would be one of the best practices that we would have a legal ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So look, start there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I think that I'm glad you brought up the Coastal Commission. I think the coastal question because this would have to go to Coastal four four for that approval. That's right. So I think I'd be interested in that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think if if if this is happening in other coastal cities, it is. And I don't think that's an unreasonable opportunity for homeowners. Sure. Give me 1/2, councilor. So so I do I would like more information if we're able to come up with a way of doing it, I think I don't I don't see the harm in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that. So just this was just my $0.02. Councilmember Pearce. I just think that that's something we can explore. So let me go. Councilmember Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to make a quick.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Interjection since it was brought up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my name was mentioned as part of the Coastal Commission. I forwarded a a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Best practice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ordinance that was adopted by Pismo Beach a while back, which was recognized by the Coastal Commission as an exemplary type of ordinance that was that fit all the criteria that we're talking about here tonight in terms of stars in a coastal zone area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that that's something that you might want to look at in terms of a of a best practice example along the coast. And of course, because of how we're set here, we're not we're a coastal city, but we have, you know, our coastline, our coastal zone, the coast.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What about a mile, mile and a half, two miles. And, you know, other areas are a lot bigger than that because it's completely a beach city. So, I mean, I think that would be an excellent starting point for looking at how we can address the coastal zone part of of this ordinance, because it's going to be obviously'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bifurcated to a great extent because of the inner inland areas where we have these issues as well as the coast. So it just that I'll put it in there and maybe something that you can look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me go back to Councilmember Pearce and Price. I know that there was a a friendly on on that issue. And so I think we're going to have staff bring that back as part of what's coming back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Well, if you accept that, that's okay. Because of what price for you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And mayor, just to clarify that, is that just to look at the one best practice. Is that says limiting on hosted or is it also for us to look at different ways to achieve that same you know, to to do that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean there might be other ways such as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I think it's both. I mean, I think you want to give us tell us how we open.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To other ways to just make sure that we we're addressing it. Okay. Understood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. And just on that note, I appreciate Councilman Aranguiz comments on this, because one of the things for coastal zones that's very unique is many of them have high density and parking impacts. And so when we have an hosted, then there is a potential there to have additional cars taking available spots on the street or even in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the beach, lots and other noise and other types of impacts that that really are detrimental. Again, I think getting a petition by two thirds vote is much harder than a lot of people think. I mean, we see that with preferential parking districts or even when residents want to do like a one way street.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Everyone always thinks everyone in their neighborhood thinks like them. But when it comes to them signing a petition, that's not always the case. But I think neighborhoods having that option to be able to have a meaningful voice and what impacts they might have is good.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a good option. And so I'd be interested to see what the best practices are. And my support of an ACR ordinance would most certainly include an option that allows residents to have a voice through a petition process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I like the sliding scale idea. I'm just sharing with my colleagues that I heard it for the first time tonight and I like it. I think it makes a lot of sense in terms of the number of units.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I also like the 1% limitation. I mean. It's much more lucrative to have a short term rental than it is to have a long term rental. And what that does is it really limits the supply of long term rentals we have available, especially in the coastal zone, because there's so much money to be made per night for'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a short term rental in the coastal zone than to have a house that's, you know, workforce rates or affordable rates in the coastal zone. And so I think being mindful of the fact that we do want to have options for our residents to have housing that they can actually afford.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They cannot compete with short term rental rates on a monthly basis. So I think having a 1% cap citywide is a good one. The the biggest problem that I see with any ordinance that we establish is enforcement. You know, I don't want us to be in the position where right now we have a ban on SDR, someone'",
        "'speaker_11': ', a resident, calls us and has a complaint. The burden is totally on them to go and investigate, you know, find the listing, take pictures, you know, be the be very, you know, slick and identifying and grabbing evidence. It puts our residents in a very difficult situation where they're in a.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Conflict situation with people who might be staying in the house next door to them. I don't want to do that. So whatever we do and I'm I've talked with Councilwoman Pierce about that, Councilmember Pierce about this. I like the idea of coming back and talking about the enforcement piece in a more detailed and robust way, because I'",
        "'speaker_11': 'think it's generally touched upon. But but I'd really like to understand how are we going to enforce this? And I'd like the taxes that are collected to go right back into enforcement, at least a part of them. I anticipate the taxes that would be collected would.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would exceed the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Costs that would we would need for one or two people to help enforce. And where that money goes in up above the enforcement mechanism, I'd love to hear my colleagues thoughts, but at the very least, we should be putting that tax money into enforcement mechanisms.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And really, I do. I fully expect that whatever option council comes back with will include the platform to work with the city. I know there's pending lawsuits going on. I'll be watching those very closely. But the platforms have to be part of this process and engaged with the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It can't just be completely our burden if we don't have full access to data. So I'm open to seeing how, how what that looks like and and whether there's third party vendors, which I'm hearing is an opportunity for us to be able to work with maybe a third party vendor to help us collect some of the data'",
        "'speaker_11': '. I'm open to all of that, but to me, a partnership between the platforms and the city should be something more concrete. What is that going to look like? And so I, I fully support Councilmember Pierce's recommendation that staff meet with the platforms more than just the main platform that's come forward and engaged with us, which I'm grateful'",
        "'speaker_11': 'for, but with all of them, because it's also not fair to put all the burden on the largest platform. That's not fair to that platform either. There are a lot of different platforms, and everybody should be sharing in this in this process of setting forth policies and procedures.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think we do need to come back with a more robust and specific enforcement plan. So those are my thoughts, and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whatever we do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm hoping that this council is supportive of us coming back in about a year or so and really using this as a pilot period so that we can figure out what's working and what's not working. Have there been impacts in neighborhoods as a result of this ordinance that we need to address?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I look forward again to hearing your thoughts on that as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I want to start by addressing a comment from the audience regarding a survey that says I put online. I actually went out into the audience and saw the survey. It was not conducted by my office. But I do appreciate that neighborhood associations have taken the time to put surveys out there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It would also be helpful, though, when they do put those surveys out there that they communicate the results to our offices because we actually didn't have access to that private survey. So it was very interesting information and I appreciate the dialog and thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to kind of just start with an overarching discussion on. Buying a home is your one of your largest, most likely your largest financial investment of your life? And the number one thing that I have learned as a council member is the most important decision you make in buying a house is not how many bedrooms, it's'",
        "'speaker_9': 'not how many bathrooms. It's not any of that. It's who are your neighbors? The number one complaint that I get is I bought a house across the street from a park, but I didn't realize there would be cars and people in the park all summer or I bought a house across the street from a school in the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'summer and I didn't realize that when school started there'd be pick up and drop off and my driveway would be blocked or these things. And when I bought a house next door, I didn't realize I lived next to the the grumpy person in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And now I know why they're divorced three times. These are actual comments our office gets. And part of that goes to it's about who your neighbor is. And so we currently have a short term rental in our neighborhood that used to be a long term rental that had a horrible tenant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the neighborhood is like jumping for joy that it's a short term rental. Now, however, there are other circumstances where there were wonderful neighbors that live there and they were not renewed on their lease. And now it is a short term rental in that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that street particularly is very upset because they don't want a short term rental. So it's all about what you had before and what you have now in that comparison and knowing and understanding and whether you live next door to people who own their home, people who rent a home, whether they're visitors through a platform, whether you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'live near a park or a school, every single thing brings different pluses and different minuses. And so I think it's a good starting point. I would love for the ordinance to be as simple as possible. I agree with some of my colleagues who have stated if it's overly complicated, it's hard to monitor, it's hard to enforce, and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it's hard for us to really get our arms around to explain to people who may want to get into this market, people who may need this money. I mean, I'm fortunate that my mom was here with me tonight and she was in the back and we were watching the meeting together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I was kind of talking through her with her what what it would look like if she turned her rental property into an Airbnb and why people do it and what the platforms look like. And we were kind of doing that in context with the comments on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We really appreciate all the comments tonight, so many well-informed neighbors, but there are a lot of people in that age group who could benefit that don't understand it because our ordinance could potentially be too complicated. So I'm all in favor of simplifying if the sliding scale is used or the 1% is used, all of those are great'",
        "'speaker_9': '. I have a short statement that I want to read that I compiled after reading through the emails and talking to the neighbors that I was able to get to, many of you know, I didn't get to everyone. It's a heavy night on agenda items, so I had a lot of people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Short term rentals can have a big impact on neighborhoods and cities, both positive and not so positive. And as we've seen in the public comment tonight and in the news, we need to be aware of both sides of the issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So because of that, I'd like to make a friendly amendment. I'd like to direct staff to track the implementation of whichever ordinance we pass and the impacts of the stars, including the number of registrations, the number of complaints, resolutions to the complaints, total tax received, and other relevant data that can be reviewed at a council meeting in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'October of 2019. So we'll have the data from last summer included in that and then we can see the full impact over several months. And then at that time we can say we love it the way it is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We'd like to make the following tweaks, we'd like to get rid of it altogether and all of those. So now that we would all at least be on the same page, that whatever we pass, let's be invested in making it the best we can, and let's continue to learn through that process so that a year from now'",
        "'speaker_9': ', or a little less than a year from now, we can sit down and have a talk about where we've made the mistakes and what improvements we can make, but that we're all on the same page to know that another set of changes could come and what that timeline is, so that we can all be in a position'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to plan our future, because this type of ordinance impacts people's finances, and that's a really important concept. So I would hope that the maker of the motion would be open to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, definitely open to that. I have a couple of questions that you mentioned from last October.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'From now to next October?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From now until next October. Okay. And I think whenever we talked about that third party verification group, I think staff will really find that there's a plethora of ways to track data daily that on on any day you could pull up the dashboard and see where we're at on that day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I wholeheartedly support that for sure.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think if I can add just two points to that, we can we can certainly do some of that. When an ordinance is in place, it's going to be easier for us to get that data. So right now, we don't really get a lot of the complaints that we get some, but we don't really hear about everything'",
        "'speaker_12': '. We also don't have much of a way to track them without paying a consultant, which we did as part of this effort. And they, you know, it was it was a pretty intensive effort over three weeks. So the more this occurs, once the ordinance goes into effect, the easier it is on staff.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But we can do our best to bring you back what we can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if we could say a year from the day that the ordinance was implemented, that we have 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the reason that I was hoping to do October of 2019 is because one budget and two, we also would get through the summer months, which for short term rentals are really the bulk here. I mean, if it was Palm Springs, our bulk of months would be the January through March.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But in Long Beach, coastal city, it's really summer. So I was hoping that summer would have passed. They would have had a short amount of time to gather that and bring it back to us so that we would be able to make some strong decisions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm fine with bringing it back in October for the budget. I think as we move forward to having that year evaluation, at least for the first three years, where every year we're looking at it and assessing it, our housing market's going to change drastically in the next several years or so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in future years I'm open for it to come back as a two from four like that. It wouldn't have to be a full council meeting, but I think in this first review period to have that additional open comment from the community and engagement is just really crucial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we will bring back by October 2019 what we what we know, what we have based on the information we have, knowing that it may not be as robust as we'd like. And then once the ordinance goes into effect, we would do an annual review with the information that was requested.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So my next comment kind of goes to one of the first items I brought to the City Council. When elected in 2014, I brought a refund of your business license to the table because one of the things I feel strongly about is, one, getting all the businesses above board where they all have the licenses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then also if you're going to open a new opportunity in our city that we would not want to burden you with those cost in their first two years. So we did that business license. We tried to do a waiver, but the city attorney advised us we could do a refund of those fees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we we instituted a policy where we would refund your fees. But I do believe that registration is key. Not everyone uses the same platforms, whether you're using a far below or Airbnb or whatever. Some people register their homes on multiple sites for multiple types of renters that are looking in different sites.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so for that, I feel that the registration process is really important so that we can track better. I'm supportive of a reduced fee or zero out fee on some of them. It's interesting to talk about 1% of our housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We don't even know what the housing stock of Long Beach is. If you call the county assessor and ask how many units are in Long Beach, they cannot tell you because it's so complicated. So the registration process would at least get us to a point to kind of know, but we need it to be as simple as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'possible. And so I'm really supportive of a registration. I'm also really supportive of a warning and then a very severe penalty if you don't register, because otherwise there's no incentive to get on board. And we've seen this in Manhattan Beach and some of the coastal cities that people are hiding their addresses and moving things around and and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'really trying to hide under underneath the radar. We need to be above the radar. I would also say that if the platform is not willing to work with us, they shouldn't be able to book locally. There's so many opportunities with local platform or with these platforms that they could collect the tax for us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They theoretically could even do the registration for us. But it gets more complicated when people are registered on multiple sites. You don't want people to have to pay multiple registration. So with that, I'd also like to warn the Council Against and I know we talk about this and Mr. GROSS or as he called himself earlier, Mr. Sunshine'",
        "'speaker_9': 'is not here right now. I am completely supportive of bringing back a component of adding staffing once revenues hit certain targets. But I would be careful about directing staffing. I'm sorry, directing revenues, as we've heard about with the directed revenues we were doing for marijuana, they haven't come in as planned.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's all sorts of different fluctuations. So if we think a staff member is needed, just pass a staff member from the general fund and just call it what it is. And in the future, then you still have that flexibility to add or subtract as you go.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I would just generally as chair of budget oversight and having heard Mr. GROSS say it, probably at every meeting we've ever had with him, I'm just going to say it for him so that he doesn't have to do it next time that he warns against that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I support that warning. Lastly, about the option three, add on from Councilman Price. I appreciate that. In our neighborhoods, we have some problem neighbors and whether there are short term rental or whatever the case may be of what causes them to be a problem.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What I wouldn't want to do, though, is I have a street. Let's just say we went with a 20 foot radius. So you take a house within 2000 feet. That's where you'd have to do the petition. What I wouldn't want to do is say like a housing track.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if this housing tract votes no, all houses in the track are banned. What I would like to do is if you have a bad player to be able to collect the signatures to get them to go away.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Kind of like the dog barking. And the reason I say that is if you have a home housing track that has three good Airbnbs or FRB, far or whatever, short term rentals, and then you have one bad actor and that petition circulates.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It takes the income away from three people who might be snowbirds or other things. And so I just want to. I want to hit a nail on the head. I don't want a pepper spray a problem, if that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, this is the problem. Whac-A-Mole. Move on to the next problem. If I could do that with some of the other neighborhood issues we have, it would be so much easier. But I would also like it to be an easier process than our current barking dog complaint process because that people are not fulfilled and not able'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to resolve their issues. So I want to just make sure that we kind of look at that and how it's directed to the one person. So that would be my feedback and appreciate the discussion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you very much, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. So a couple of things. So, number one, the turnout in the public testimony clearly shows that this you know, this is an issue that people care about pocketbook issues. So we'll take it with the utmost seriousness.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I acknowledge all of you for coming out. I also acknowledge Airbnb for coming to the table because I understand there are multiple platforms that engage here. So that needs to be acknowledged. And given that it's a pocketbook issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to just frame and say that, you know, the narratives that I hear about are the narratives of abuse. You know, take an entire, you know, entire buildings and turn them into pseudo motels. I think this ordinance, what it puts forward, prevents those apartment motels apart tales of different different ways of referring to these things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that's good. It addresses abuse. The other thing I hear about is the speculation someone who was not a Long Beach resident, you know, owning, you know, five, six, seven properties in other cities and are simply speculating.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, the problem with that for me is that those revenues generated. They're not you know, there have been if anyone in Long Beach, they're not staying in Long Beach. And that's that's you know, I don't think that we should be in that business and we should be keeping our properties as our housing market as stable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as possible. So anything we can do to limit that speculation, I clearly support. But also say that there's value in having Long Beach residents and working with Long Beach residents if it's unhosted. You know, this policy is going to change over time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you want to build up some. You want to give them a shot to see what they can do in terms of maintaining a standard of quality, quality of life and responding to their neighbors when there's a complaint and in following and monitoring this ordinance and not necessarily attempting to game the system so that I think there's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'value in that. I also think, you know, when I saw that map, the great majority of these properties, they're down in districts two in District three. And I think the two council members are doing a pretty good job understanding each one of those issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that's great. And so I just want to make sure that, you know, you know, the few just north of them that I think those are families that are just, you know, trying to make ends meet or have an extra room or going from, you know, their first home to their second home.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we should make sure that as new technologies emerge, as these disruptive technologies emerge, we we make sure that it's accessible to working families as well and that they can benefit from this these economic opportunities. So I do want to want to lift that up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Speaking of local, in meeting with them and meeting with individuals, some of the hosts that came in, you know, I heard stories about how they're you know, they're proud to highlight different attributes about their neighborhood and proud to highlight, you know, where to get your groceries or where to get local food.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I see a big opportunity here for the city to partner with these hosts and with Airbnb to create. And well, I shouldn't say the idea yet, but the idea here is that let's create some some real local partnership to support local businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and, you know, we can think about partnering with Kiva businesses. It's the businesses we're supporting through crowdfunding. That's when the community comes together to support and deploy resources, these small businesses. There are other things we can do, like leverage new technology to also support these small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think in this too, from in this report back, I'd like for staff to do some thinking about leveraging this power that was just created through this platform to really amplify the local business, the local impact for those local, local businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, Councilwoman Pearce, I know we chatted a little bit about that. Is that something you'd like to think you would include in your motion?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. I love it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. Great. Thank you. Just the policy points that I'll call out that sound that sound good to me. The concept of the registry, you know, we've got a lot of experience in registries in our city. You know, we were involved in creating the foreclosure registry, the vacant lot monitoring registry, you know, the vacant building registry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's experience there. And I think this makes sense in this particular case and in the foreclosure registry case, you have almost full compliance from the banks on the foreclosure registry because they threatened of a fine and they've never had to actually levy the fine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was $1,000 a day fine to banks who leave these foreclosures in your neighborhood, you know, with, you know, vagrancy and weeds and all these things, they've never had to find a bank because the banks responded by just by the threat of a of a fine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that makes sense. Having a registry makes sense. I think the 1.1% cap on the house or the housing market, that that does acknowledge the housing stocks on the search situation with the housing crisis. So that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think what Councilwoman Pierce said about taking a good look at evaluating whatever the verification process is makes sense. I look forward to hearing what comes back there. One question about the shift from 25% to 10%, just from a practical standpoint, when I think 25% of 25% can be rented out, I think in a four unit, that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'means one unit. I think 10%. I think of a bigger building. So how would a 10%, you know, we should think about how does 10% happen when it's less than ten units?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one of my concerns outside of a duplex is that those units that are 8 to 10 are typically what somebody like me would run versus somebody that owns a condo on Ocean Boulevard that is a bigger unit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Therefore, those condos are probably higher cost. And you're not removing a lower cost housing?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I get that. What I'm talking about is 10% of a eight unit is not a full unit. So what happens if. Right. What happens if it's a fraction? Right. The 25% means at least I get a Lexus.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At least one unit. Mm hmm. Right. So I think maybe up to ten, you got to say 25%, and then it turns into ten after that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think they get to there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they're sliding scale point. So they're going to present to us the sliding scale. I think it'll fix that time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That makes sense when I'm when I'm saying to get two.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Whole units and round up. But definitely look at different ways of that that we are we do think about that a 10% of a four simply before doesn't even get you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we do want to look at that in the slide. And we're going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To rule out when I Airbnb out the bathroom. Great. Well, look, it seems like this conversation is headed in the right direction. I know that there's a lot of interest. I know that the majority are in two districts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But let's be frank. All of you have lobbied all nine of us. And so there are expectations that we become familiar with this policy. We understand it because this won't be the first time that we see it. And I know that there will be changes, but it seems like things are heading in the right direction and I'm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'supportive of the direction we're heading. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. It's been a long night that thanks, everybody, for hanging in there. Everybody did such a great job and I think my council colleagues, Pearce and Price for their comments on this issue. So I'm certainly of the mindset as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, obviously this is a huge disruptor in the market and with a disrupter, we often sometimes turn to regulation and we don't often have to do that. But I think I'm sort of in this middle space. I come from downtown, everybody loves R&B, Airbnbs and downtown, but we have to do so mindfully and with respect to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the community. And we absolutely hear that tonight. First and foremost, I want to say the housing and business opportunities to individuals and the city of Long Beach, you know, looks good with this. The 12% total, obviously, is is something that was mandated by voters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would just like to reiterate the points of of ensuring that what the information we get back I do want to support affordable housing in any way we can, whether it's through the linkage fee or the 6% that we if we can create that or add that to an existing housing trust fund, that would be ideal, in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'my sense, to to do that. I think this is the whole gist of of what everybody is talking about on both sides. That's the first and foremost thing. Second thing related to affordable housing that I just had a question on and I wasn't clear in the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'ADDUCE Does that include new ADU use or is it existing? Adus Because I have an issue with just the state's loosening of reforms on adus.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looking forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was proposed to include any idea whether it's existing or new. They would both be treated as an idea, new or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Proposed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So on the ad use, Councilwoman Gonzalez, we currently, as you know, banned them in the ADA ordinance for short term rental purposes. So if we bring something back that where you want to include ADOS as part of the, you know, acceptable uses for short term rental, we'd have to bring back to edu ordinance and amend that as'",
        "'speaker_12': 'well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to make sure we banned it from my memory that we did banned it. We didn't do ordinance when it came out. Okay. Just making sure of that because it was unclear in the presentation. It just included adus for primary residents and I thought that was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So is that existing then? ADOS. I'm just making sure. I'm just trying to clarify it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So our current.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Ordinance, we require everybody that gets an approved EDU to sign a document that certifies that they will not use it for short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So then I just want to because the presentation says, the staff report says a bit differently. So that's why I want to make sure we're on the same page to ensure that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that is the case. So current law right now, if you have an EDU, you're not allowed to have a short term rental. And it just is you actually are not allowed to have a short term rental anywhere in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So when you did the ADU ordinance, we banded so that you would have the ability to make a decision in the future going forward. We are recommending in the options that an edu be an allowable use so that it would be allowed to be a short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We would consider that a hosted model so that you're actually because you're on site and that's in your backyard or or however it's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Attached at this point that we're suggesting.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, we're suggesting that it be considered part of the hosting now. So that would be something the council would vote on and decide to include or not include.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So I would just. I would just like us to think about. The existing, you know, grandfathering those in and then any additional because I just feel a little awkward in creating additional ADOS that we've loosened reforms on that were intended for affordable housing that we're now putting on the market for short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's where I feel a little. A little off with, you know, what we've made in past policy decisions so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Council when it wasn't clear is your proposal that any new ADOS not be allowed as hosted ACR? Is that what you're saying?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, here's what I'm yes, I'm I'm going in that direction. But I'd like to get some numbers on what how many of the ideas that we have got permits that we've received so far, and we can make that determination at that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I just I feel a little shaky on that, just given the fact that we had that policy specifically for affordable housing. Thank you. Okay. And then the next is, I believe in the consistency with noise and events.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think noise and events should be consistent all around. Whether you're a homeowner, that doesn't the long term, short term doesn't matter. Absolutely. That needs to be consistent whether no matter what. And on the parking situation, I was actually looking into the city of Palm Springs and I was unclear as we talked about parking and not being'",
        "'speaker_5': 'able to regulate parking the city of Palm Springs. I believe if you have a short term rental and or want to host an event which we don't have here, but especially for just in general short term rentals, they have a plan where you are allowed one car per room.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if you have four rooms. You're allowed four cars. That's it. I think that to me seems like a reasonable suggestion, but I don't know what that looks like on the enforcement side. I know that they're given a parking permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know you had mentioned something about. Zoning.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that's something we can go back and take a hard look at, particularly we'll look at the Palm Springs ordinance. I think I just want to acknowledge that might be problematic because once a unit is is approved and it's already up, it essentially has its land use approvals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I don't know that we could ask for additional parking spaces just by virtue of it becoming a short term rental unit. But we can certainly look at that and we'll bring you back some suggestions based upon what I think is the direction you're going.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just think that would be, I think, alleviate a lot of the neighborhood issues, especially in parking impacted neighborhoods. I think everything else we've covered the highway outreach. I'm just personally interested in that. A lot of houses have kind of back and forth said that they do want stars.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm just interested in knowing whether this information will live on our website like fake news, how that will look outwardly. I know a lot of other cities just have that available and I think that it needs to live somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just for clarity, once we get this all figured out. And then lastly, a lot more platform accountability, data access. I'm also just very curious as to what the lawsuits will provide. I also think we just got to be, you know, just tread a little lightly here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have bad actors in every industry, even in this. You know, I've advocated for many years the apartment association knows the slumlords that exist in my my district. I want us to be as proactive on them as we are on the bad actors here in Airbnb, which I know are very few.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, I just want to say that and ensure that we're consistent in all respects. So thank you so much, everybody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I still have a long list of things to go through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First, I want to. Make some clarifying points. Can you speak about the Mello Act and how that might impact short term rentals in the coastal zone? I know not everybody up here is a mellow eyed fan, but you are aficionado.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is currently on our work program and we have the. In looking at the the 29 housing policies and that's something we are just starting to to scratch the surface. So we will be looking at that really carefully.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think the first step is to probably do a24 from and just bring you back to current status of where we are on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. And just including how stars might be affected in the memo as well. To the point of the eighth use, I just want to say I like I like the idea of grandfathering in those that exist now and limiting those in the future, because that was done as a as an attempt to get more affordable housing and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to increase our housing supply. I also wanted to clarify. I know that we have some different language and how we're talking about hosted and hosted versus primary resident and not primary resident. And so making sure that when we talk about excluding areas of non unhosted that we're talking about non primary residence of people that don't live in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'those buildings. Going to Councilmember Price's point. That's how staff understands it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then also the 1% I know when I spoke with staff earlier and I wanted to make sure it was clarified that the 1% is for non primary residents. That would make up two to that point that you guys had that as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Oh, so that wasn't clear. So 1% is only on non primary residents, so you could go above the 1% if you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Live in your home and you're.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Understood you can write that in there. Yeah, that's clear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the part that I'm totally left off, even though I did have it in my notes as I wanted and I've talked to many groups about this was also including in the enforcement, the private right of action, an administrative subpoena.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think that those are the things that we're comfortable with now. And knowing that when you guys come back, we'll talk about the data and we'll talk about the the fines and penalties. As it relates to two platforms, if that is the case.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with that, I'm very excited, guys. I hope that we can. I look forward to getting lots of data and reevaluating this a year. And I want to say how much I appreciate staff, particularly with working with me today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know I was very busy in meetings and committees and trying to to process some of this. So again, thank you guys very much for coming and meeting with us and working with us. And I really do think that this is going to be something that protects housing, that gives the city, you know, a path forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Just briefly, I do want to clarify the the petition the neighborhood petition option that that I'm envisioning is different than petitioning to get a bad actor removed because the bad actor would come as a result of the fines and penalties where the final penalty is that you can't operate an SDR for a period of time'",
        "'speaker_11': ', like a year or something. What I would hate for us to do is have neighbors petitioning against a particular home owner. I just think that's a really could be a confrontational situation. The petition concept that I'm talking about is the option three.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I just want to understood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Well, we we do have a motion in a second. And I want to just add that I think this conversation is actually going in a really good direction. I think there's a lot of information that we're getting back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's clear that that both those that are those that are hosting want to be regulated and want to follow the rules and want to be a part of of the process. And it's also clear that regulations are needed so that we are following what all other cities are doing around Airbnb.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we also know from those of us that use Airbnb, that the services that's being provided by many folks is, is really great service. And people many people are choosing not to stay in a traditional hotel experience because they want to be in a neighborhood or they want a different experience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I appreciate that that interest people appreciate that there is so much interest in Long Beach. And at the same time, I want to thank those I've talked to a lot of Airbnb hosts that are also understand the issues around housing and understand the issues that that we have around availability of housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the conversations around funding and how we get to bringing some some additional revenue to address those issues, I think are also important. So just think, everybody, we do have a master motion on the floor. I think you have written it down as we as we went along, which I appreciate that, Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please cast your votes and actually we'll do a roll call vote. I'm not sure if Councilman Austin is there, still is comfortable and he's got someone else. And so there you are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, let's start. Let's start with Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'type uses. So that's essentially why we're here tonight. It is based upon a complaint that the city received from the Department of Justice regarding our current zoning code. And the observation that they made is that our code has not been updated since probably 20 years to specifically address religious uses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this was essentially a clean up. It gave us the opportunity to go back and update our code to treat assembly uses for religious institutions in the same way that we treat other assembly uses, such as a movie theater, a banquet hall and other types of uses where you have an assembly type characteristic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So fundamentally what this code does is it updates the definitions it goes through.

We've eliminated the use of calling it churches and we now refer to them as religious institutions.'",
