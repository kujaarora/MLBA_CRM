This item before you is an appeal by the applicant of specific conditions of approval imposed on a conditional use permit for the sale of alcohol at a grocery outlet grocery store'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Council is being requested to uphold the Planning Commission decision on this matter on September 16th of this year. The Planning Commission conditionally approved a conditional use permit to allow the off site sale of beer, wine and distilled spirits in conjunction with a 6000 square foot expansion of an existing approximately 14,000 square foot grocery store.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The grocery store in question is located at 13/47 Street on the south side of Seventh Street between Almond and Nebraska Avenues in the central area of the city. The grocery store is a tenant in the existing shopping center and will comprise that will comprise just over 20,000 square feet with the expansion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The project site is predominately surrounded by residential uses, but properties in the vicinity have a variety of zoning designations, including commercial mixed use and residential zoning, as shown on the map. On this slide, the grocery store currently has a conditional use permit to allow the offsite sale of beer and wine, which was approved by the Planning Commission'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in 2008. The subject conditional use permit is required because of the expansion of the liquor license to include the offsite sale of distilled spirits and also due to the expanded footprint of the grocery store and those operations. The Planning Commission based its approval on the fact that positive findings could be made in support of the request, particularly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as it relates to limitations related to overconcentration of alcohol sales and allowing alcohol sales in high crime areas. You can see here the Planning Commission did find that the approval would not contribute to an overconcentration of alcohol licenses in the area at this location, as this location already has an alcohol license and that the site is not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'located in a high crime area and thus determined that the required conditions are met and positive findings could be found. The subject of appeal was filed by the applicant, who has concerns specifically related to two conditions conditions number 14 and 20.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'This approval already does allow the sale of craft beers in that container size. As previously stated, council is requested to uphold the Planning Commission decision. However, if council wishes to consider alternatives, there are some alternative modification or modifications to the conditions that could be considered.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The condition number 20 and option of the Council is to update the condition to allow the applicant to be relieved of the requirement after a 12 month period with a zoning administrator review for condition number 14, that condition could be modified to grant an exception in container size for microbrews and specialty malts, so sold under certain designations'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Good evening. My name is Steve Rawlings. I'm a business consultant to grocery outlet. Joining me this evening is Pat Barber, who is the vice president of real estate for grocery outlets, as well as Dave O'Connell, who is the property manager for the shopping center that this site is located'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in. First of all, we greatly appreciate the Planning Commission for approving us to move forward with a 6000 square foot expansion, as well as be able to add some distilled spirits. The only reason we're here is we were just hoping for some consideration on a little bit of modification on the particular conditions of approval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One was as as Patricia, so well articulated. Just just don't allow us to be able to sell craft beer in in kind of the 22 and 24 ounce containers. And what was presented to you as draft modification language is is acceptable to us, and that would allow us to accomplish what we're trying to do there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second was was the security guard. There was a time that was placed between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., which we didn't we didn't quite understand where that was coming from. But that was ultimately the condition that was adopted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Subsequent to that, we hear Patterson, who is the store operator, a Long Beach resident. We met with her as well as Lieutenant Gonzales out at the site. And Barbara, myself, to kind of talk about, you know, security issues and what we could do to, you know, make sure that we're helping out with the situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He informed everybody that she already employs a person whose sole job is, you know, security and or loss prevention from the hours of 4 p.m. to closing Monday, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. She's been on the property now for about four years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She's the hardest working person you'll ever meet. She's at that store 60, 70 hours each and every week. She understands what it takes to run a clean and safe operation. And she is determined that that those are the best hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, our request was, you know, hey, if we could be relieved of that condition because we're already proactively trying to take care of any issues out there, and we haven't been a great source of issues with our operations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But alternatively, if the Council would like to see a specific condition in there, we would just ask that it be aligned a little bit more with what we're already doing, because I think that that has proven to be effective and that, you know, that security plan be open for review either by the zoning administrator.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I proposed the Long Beach Police Department and it doesn't make a difference to us either way. So in essence, that is the request. Grocery outlet already operates three stores in Long Beach. They did sign a lease for a to open another store on Long Beach Boulevard and Willow.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're hoping to get that open relatively soon. They have been embraced by the neighborhoods that they they serve. They're very happy that they've been making investments in your community and are looking forward to possibly continuing to make more investments there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for your time and consideration. I think Pat just had one or two other quick comments. Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We still have about a minute and a half. So for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Little.'",

I've seen thousands of shopping centers and grocery stores. It is exceedingly rare. In my observance, it is true for a city to require that a security person be stationed at certain hours in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a store. This existing store, which has been operated by IKEA for four years plus without getting into details about how a grocery outlet does business has not had a problem. She's there all the time. She sees what the issues are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She deals with them. We have had no complaints filed by any of the people that received the notice of this meeting. I just say we really don't think that it's at all necessary for you to make a specific requirement with regard to a security person for the store, given that the operator of this store herself, who's black'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and who's a woman and who's very involved in the community and has received awards within the community for her involvement with the community should be overruled by you folks. You know a lot of things, but she knows a lot about operating this store.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And I believe that's how it's been been done. That is correct. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to follow the rules that are in place for the hearing, for and for the council. So there's a motion and there's no public comment about Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I might. My job is to follow the rules established by the City Council on hearings. So unless I get direction differently from the city attorney because it's a legal procedure, I have to follow exactly the rules that are set by the body and the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So unless I'm told differently by the attorney, that's the rules I have to follow. So let me. Sir. Sir, I need to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Allen. All right. First of all, I want to say thank you to city staff director R.C. and Development Services. Detective Gonzalez, Avon Police Department, for your frequent communication with my office. I also enjoyed seeing Payton, Steve and the folks here from a grocery outlet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel that with regards to city staff that you engage both the community and the applicant to work and find solutions for for all the parties. And I know that it can be really hard some time sometimes to balance all the issues on on different sites.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That being said, the Planning Commission unanimously voted on these conditions, and I have carefully reviewed the circumstances and staff's updated recommendations. So the two items of the appeal are separate. I do support the modification to condition 14, allowing the sale of a 22 ounce to 24 ounce beer and malt beverages.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think these are common sizes these days for local and small breweries and they reduce the bottling cost. Now, with regard to Condition 20, the security guard condition, if we were able to update the condition to allow the applicant to be relieved of the requirement for the onsite security guard by allowing the zoning administrator action after a'",
        "'speaker_0': '12 month period of good operations can only shorten the minimal period of good operations before possibly relieving the operator of this security guard requirement.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That to six months. That's the pleasure of the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I also I received the supplemental letter sent in by grocery outlet regarding that condition, and I've seen the public comments that were also submitted to the Planning Commission as well. And I believe the city staff has created a good balance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I like to make the like to move the following. I like to approve the amendment to condition 14 as outlined by the staff, and also update condition 20 to allow the applicant to be relieved of the requirement for the onsite security guard, by the way, of zoning administrator action after a six month period of good operations'",

Throughout the region, cities have been tackling the public restroom issue differently and starting six or seven years ago, when I was first elected, we had park bathroom issues within our parks, adjacent to our sports fields and other areas where the ability to keep them clean throughout the day was just impossible.'",

Staff that were requested to go out and do those lock ups were often threatened and put in harm's way. We need a better solution.

I think that they need to be extremely clean, extremely safe, because the purpose of having the restrooms in our parks'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I think if there's one minute we're getting the staff. Thank you, members of the city council. We're happy to present tonight on a lot of work that's gone into reviewing Parklets on the second street quarter. And I will turn it over to Eric Lopez and his team to give the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Tom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the San Diego will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Start with some.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What, some initial comments, and then Carlos is going to walk us through a presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He got. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council, thank you for having us here this evening. I'm just going to provide a little context. Before Carl Hickman, our traffic engineer, provides the the formal report on this. And there's a misconception, it appears in the public that the discussion between temporary parklets and permanent parklets and that the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'existing temporary structures could potentially be converted to permanent. And before we get started, I just want to make sure everybody's clear that that is not the case. Permanent parklet structures have very different requirements than temporary parklet structures. I'm here to tell you tonight that none of the temporary structures currently anywhere in the city would qualify as a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'permanent structure. And in each case, those structures would have to be removed and a new structure would be installed, assuming that it meets the requirements of a permanent structure, which are a lot more stringent than the temporary ones.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just to start it off, I wanted to make sure everybody understood that any discussion about making temporary parklets permanent does not mean that the existing structure would be revised to be considered permanent. So that said, I'd like to turn it over to Carl Hickman, our traffic engineer, who's going to give us an update this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. This has been a long road. We've been working on Parklets now for 18 months or so and we've done quite a bit of work in public works to make the parklets of the program happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's get started. There's a little bit of background regarding the parklets. Again, it was a citywide effort to support the economic recovery for businesses amid the social distancing health order. The first temporary parklets were installed in May of 2020.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There was a vast majority that were installed for the 4th of July weekend in 2020. Programs peak citywide there were 124 temporary parklets 136 participating businesses because many businesses share parklets. Currently citywide, there are 96 Parklets installed and 99 participating businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ten Parklets have been removed since September alone because we are in the process of removing Parklets. When we find that business owners no longer need them or they may request us further removals, so we do have an ongoing process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When I'm contacted to remove the park, this whenever possible. Now as a licensed traffic engineer, one of my main concerns with apartments is safety. Here are some of the safety elements that I look at when we consider installing temporary parklets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We want to look to see that we have that object marker on the corner of the park that you see the yellow and black sign. That designates the corner of the parklet. We want to make sure that the remaining traveled way that's the roadway between the edge of the parklet and the centerline is a minimum of 12'",
        "'speaker_6': 'feet. Now we can varied from that occasionally, but it depends on the situation. 12 feet is the typical standard. We do look at the structural elements of the of the parklet to make sure that it is sturdy. We also fill the plastic rails, a minimum of three quarters of the way with water to make sure that they'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are able to withstand the impact from a vehicle. We do look at many stormwater drainage elements to make sure that along a curb line, water can flow like it normally would along the gutter. We also look for safe pedestrian passage on the sidewalks, make sure that there's 88 clearances and we pay close attention to utility complex.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There were some cases where some of the properties were installed over the top of gas lines that we didn't know existed. And then we found out later that we had to make modifications because we couldn't have the gas lines underneath the temporary parklets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I want to reiterate that existing temporary parklets cannot simply convert automatically to a permanent status. These temporary apartments are not designed to be permanent. They are installed with temporary type materials. So any modification to a permanent status would be a major redo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, back in September, we were asked to take a closer look at the Belmont Shore area. Why is Belmont Shore unique? Well, first of all, it's a pretty high dense neighborhood, high density, a lot of businesses, services, amenities in the area, especially between Bayshore and Livingston.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A lot of visitors visit the area. There's a lot of pedestrian activity, as you know. And of course, there's the nearby residential homes on both sides of the street. Second Street is kind of narrow, actually, although it's two lanes in each direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's still a relatively narrow roadway and it provides a direct link to PCH, Pacific Coast Highway. So really, second Street acts almost like an arterial that is really meant to serve a large volume of vehicles. Obviously there are impacts to nearby residents with all of the activity in the area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is an attractor, definitely. And of course, as I mentioned, all the traffic that goes up and down. Second is an important factor. Also the area does impact the coastal zone on the area from Livingston to Clermont is actually in the local coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which means that any kind of discussion with the coastal zone and a decision by the local coastal zone would mean that is not appealable. So current conditions in CD3, in the entire council district, there are 38 total temporary parklets and 38 participating businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On Belmont Shore Loan from Second Street to Bay Shore, there are 25 temporary parklets. 30 participating businesses. Four Parklets are shared by two or more businesses. Three businesses have a pair of temporary parklets. That means one on second and one on a side street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we also removed eight temporary parklets to date again as businesses contact us or we deem them unnecessary. We do the removals as quickly as we can. One of the issues that has come up quite often is the parking impacts in Belmont Shaw.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we did a very good inventory of all the parking spaces and we found that there were 517 total metered spaces on street, there's 351 and the public lots, there was 166 total, again 517 so far to date, as we sit right now, there are 56 stalls converted to temporary parklets, 38 stalls on Second Street and 18'",
        "'speaker_6': 'stalls on the side streets. The total available for parking still is 461 stalls. So really we've converted 11% of the total available metered stalls to parklets temporary parklets. 7% on Second Street and 4% on the side streets. And there's a graphic representation there, you know, with your pie, the slice of the pie that shows the 56 out'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the total available 517. Now, since the beginning of the program, we've had many opportunities to reach out to the public, reach out to businesses. And most recently, we reached out to the folks on Belmont Shore to have a community meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've started public and business surveys. We've had multiple discussions with CD3 and we've had multiple field inspections and business visits where we talk really candidly with the business owners, talk about are they using the the parklets? Are there any problems?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we need to make any adjustments? It's an ongoing thing and it's not going to stop. And we really think that that one on one conversation with the businesses is really a good, healthy conversation because the businesses need to understand how they're impacting not only the area, the residents, the street, but the city as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because, you know, Belmont sure is an important part of the city. So regarding our outreach, we have three parts. The first part of our outreach really was related to the business owners themselves. So we had a total of 584 total responses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And of those 584, there were 12 businesses that responded. Ten businesses are interested in keeping the temporary parklets through June of next year. Ten businesses are interested in applying for a permanent parklet. 83% agree that their temporary parklet helped their business recover amid health order and social distancing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they also admitted that only 2% are staff to at least 95% of pre-COVID levels. One of the business owners said many guests still do not feel comfortable dining indoors but want to support local restaurants, etc.. The next step in our outreach was that we wanted to talk to residents and customers of the 584 responses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can see on the on the pie charts a lot of the percentages. I won't go through all of the data, but you can see that, you know, in the center there, 30% of the customers never really use the parklets.'",
        "'speaker_6': '19% use them once a month, etc.. On the far right, you can see the chart that talks about neighborhood foot traffic, what kind of pedestrian activity is in the area, and 56% supply of the comment that there was really no change in pedestrian activity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll leave that there just for a second. If you want to take a quicker look. A longer look. Part three of the outreach. We again had 584 total responses and there were 572 customer or resident responses out of the 584.'",
        "'speaker_6': '38% support the program. 11% support but with restrictions. 12% are concerned about the parking. 6% traffic sightlines. 14% congestion and parking. And 9% were concerned about accessibility and esthetics. So on the right you'll see that the top concerns were the parking impacts, sidewalk access, esthetics, driver sightlines noise, especially on the side streets and quality of life issues'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Quality of life issues could mean some of the patrons in the restaurants or bars maybe be loitering alongside the businesses or near the residents. Some of those quality of life issues could be excessive noise. There were a variety of other complaints, again, that we call quality of life that may not be directly attributable to the parties themselves'",
        "'speaker_6': '. But nevertheless, the issue is there that needs to be addressed. And there's, again, a variety of positive feedback. Many folks value the outdoor dining option. It improves the walkability and enhances the experience. Character of Belmont Shore. Now, since the beginning of the program, we've always worked to do ongoing adjustments or improvements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We address each issue on a case by case basis. We remove temporary parklets by request. As I mentioned prior, we constantly look to make sure the departments are at the right footprint, in other words, in front of the business.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are many cases where over time the actual footprint or the perimeter of the park, this has been changed. You know, some of the business owners are kind of pushing out a little bit and expanding. So we want to make sure that people have the parklets where they're supposed to be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're checking in and filling barricade water levels and we're making sure that businesses who are nearby are okay with any encroachment into their areas. And we continue inspections by staff regularly. Now after the Open Streets Initiative ends again, existing temporary parks are not approved or designed to be permanent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have an existing permanent parklet guideline shown there on the left. That's the cover of it that's been used by the city since 2008. So it's nothing new. We already have that program in place. And if you're in the downtown area, you'll see many permanent parks already installed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On the right there, you'll see a poster board somebody created. And the first sentence says that the city of Long Beach is considering making outdoor dining parklets permanent. That is not true. We are not pushing to make temporary parklets permanent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now moving forward on Second Street. We do already have guidelines in place for businesses who want to make permanent parklets. Here's a picture of a business the socialist that fought in Saint Louis. You'll see how the sidewalk pushes out or bulbs out away from the business a little bit further.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And their they're of utilizing the hardscape to put their tables and chairs, etc.. So this is a standard that businesses who are near a corner could implement. Obviously, it's going to be for the business to install. They're going to have to pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this is an installation that we are already doing in the city, so it's nothing new. Next slide here. Again, this is what we would call a semi-permanent parklet. Again, this is an existing location, Berlin Bistro Fourth and Linden, where as part of the guideline on the right there, you'll see how we design this type of a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'parklet to be semi-permanent. If that business were to go away, we could technically remove that parklet and it would be a done deal. So ideally I mentioned earlier in the presentation that we had ten businesses who were interested in becoming permanent parklets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And really I think that that was sort of a knee jerk reaction to our last meeting back in September, where many businesses were probably unsure of the program, where it was going. A couple of those businesses who have applied to be permanent, we were already removed their temporary parklets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So but let's look at the worst case scenario. If those ten permanent parklet businesses who want permanent parklets were to actually get them go through the process. We're talking about a loss of approximately 20 stalls. The original total meet total needed spaces is 517.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we would only have to convert 4%, approximately 4% of the stalls to permanent parklets. And I want to point out that businesses need to understand that when it comes time to do a permanent parklet, not only do they have to go through the rigorous process that's already in place, but there will be a cost associated with'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that to design the installation, etc.. And I'm predicting those costs are in the neighborhood of 40 to $50000, depending on the the nature of the exact install. So again, this is not something that's just a slam dunk. There is a rigorous process already in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So to wrap things up, we do have recommendations for Second Street, and I'll go through them slowly here. The first recommendation is to continue improvements, adjustments and inspections of existing temporary parklets. This is what we've been doing for the past 1820 months, making sure that the businesses are operating as they should be per their permits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to coordinate with businesses, businesses to remove temporary parklets whenever possible. Again, I mentioned where it's an ongoing process. We're going to work with businesses not interested in the permanent parklet so that removal of the temporary parklet can take place as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to check and refill all water filled barricades, maintain proper approvals and assurance documentation. Businesses have their insurances last quite frequently, so we have to make sure that we're on top of that. And again, anybody who's going to be interested in a permanent parklet, we're going to direct them to the existing sidewalk dining and park this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'handbook that is already in place since 2018. The next thing is Pakistan. Minor side streets will no longer be allowed in cases where there are multiple documented violations. The key here is multiple documented violations. Next. Businesses interested in a permanent Parklet must communicate in intent to apply for a permanent parklet by January 31st of next year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This will allow businesses to keep their temporary parklet until June 30th or 22 as they work through the process to finish their permanent parklet installations. We're going to organize a single effort to obtain local coastal zone approval for the businesses on Belmont Shore.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to facilitate permanent parklets that meet current construction and safety standards. And our overall goal is to allocate no more than 3 to 7% of stalls to permanent parklet installations. That concludes my presentation. And we are ready to field any questions that you may have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. There are two people queued up for public comment. Please come forward. And Jason Ileus and Brian Cochran. John, excuse me, John. I this is John here. Okay. Is Brian here? Okay, come forward. Brian. What was that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'John? Okay. All right. Make your way to the front. Thank you. Good evening. My name is John Ayers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm a property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Owner in Belmont Shore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As do parklets. Item 47 Parking in the short takes away needed parking as it was addressed and increases the occupancy levels for restaurants without providing adequate parking. Restaurants often have sidewalk dining as well as parklets for those who don't want to eat indoors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Today. Owners. Restaurants can select indoor dining as well as sidewalk dining. Again. I sent a. I had expressed my concerns a couple of months ago. At the at her. Council meeting. And I also sent a text to each council member in the past two months months expressing what I had just mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Brian. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and city council members. I first like to thank Councilwoman Suzy Price and her team for continuing this important dialog on the park issue and for engaging our constituents in a robust, thoughtful manner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's been very helpful. I'd like to urge the Council tonight to stop viewing and stop framing this issue as an either or situation that in order for businesses to survive, all considerations of residents, valid and exhaustive concerns must be secondary or worst ignored entirely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When the Council met on this issue in September. You heard from actual residents detailing both personally and on behalf of their neighbors the deep and detrimental impacts of these markets on their daily quality of life. 13 speakers addressed the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All residents there urged a no vote on continuing the program. The other five speakers were all business owners, managers or employees of those businesses. Is it any surprise they urged continuing the program to their benefit. Similarly, with the Public Works surveys, which seem to gain the questions to get a desired outcome, what kind of a fair survey'",
        "'speaker_2': 'actually points out that a business owner in the district can fill out three surveys? Of course, they and their customers want to keep the parklets running. It benefits them directly. But after the vote of that September meetings concluded, only one one owner stuck around to talk with residents and expressed an interest in their needs as neighbors and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to suggest he'd help with the quality of life issues. Just one owner. Since then, we've only seen abuses of these public spaces continue unabated and worsen. I walked Second Street again repeatedly since then on November 20th alone. I photographed vomit on a sidewalk next to a restaurant so much that a mom of a stroller had to skirt'",
        "'speaker_2': 'delicately around the stench near another restaurant. Piles of sawdust or judgment remains after some sort of food supply fallen in the street and occupied three or colleagues. Since the council turned to a lot of parklets, it's long overdue to enforce existing laws and rules and track every issue in a simple and transparent manner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City agencies and language police must be responsive to noise, traffic, trash and mobility complaints by the residents who encounter these abuses daily. This is not a new issue. It's not an either or. Since these businesses have been granted a lifeline by the city and its residents, it's essential that they act as good neighbors and accept responsibility for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the impact of their moneymaking endeavors that have caused residents so much of their quality of life. Councilmembers Pleas and the Parking Program on Second Street in the Pier Arts Interchange. Please put some teeth into enforcing the abuses created by the program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment. Taking behind the dias, Councilwoman Fries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. So I want to start by thanking our staff for your work on this. I know that beyond just the three gentlemen that are here tonight presenting, there is a team of people whose work who have worked very hard on this issue, and they've been engaged with my office throughout the entire few months'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we've been studying this issue. And you've really taken their concerns to heart, and this report is fantastic. So thank you. I really, really appreciate that. I also want to thank the community members. We had so many community members volunteer to go door to door to pass out the cards for the surveys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that was really important. And I think that's one of the reasons that we had about 584 responses. And and so I want to thank them both. The Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Shore Residents Association and the and the Friends of Belmont Shore were two community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Organizations that worked very closely with me on this issue. It's interesting when you have an issue like this, because depending on who you talk to, they will swear that everyone they have talked to agrees with them on the issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So over the last couple of months, I've gotten emails that say, you know, I have lived in the city in certain number of years and I everyone that I have talked to insert opposes or supports the PARKLETS and I just have gotten a ton of emails like that and there's absolutely no consensus by the residents entirely on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the issue of Parklets on Second Street. And I will say that I suspect and there's probably some data to support that multiple people took that survey. The Baltimore people took the survey multiple times. And I don't know which side of whether they're supporting our opposing, but the survey is meant to be an outreach effort.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not a scientific survey. It's an outreach effort to try to gauge interest. And I want to thank staff for putting it together. I also want to thank a staff for clarifying that. And I'm not sure where this confusion occurred, and I'm disappointed that it did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the permanent PARKLET program is totally different from the Open Streets Initiative. We've had permanent parklet options available in the city forever. All of this in my district, the social list. These are all businesses that have gotten permanent parklets way before the COVID pandemic even hit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to conflate those two is has has mixed up the message quite a bit. And in fact, I myself, when I was reading the presentation earlier, thought Slide 15 was relevant to our current situation and not the hypothetical situation of permanent parklets being issued.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there is a lot of confusion there, and I just want to thank staff for clarifying that. I do want to point out that some eight, I believe, is that current eight parklets were removed. Eight Parklets were removed as a result of our discussions and our efforts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what we did was we went out and Mr. Cochrane talked about the business owners that were here last time. Both the Panama Joes owner, as well as the Georges Greek owner, stayed after the last council meeting, and the Panama Joes owner actually voluntarily removed their parklet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we've had eight parklets removed, which to me is tremendous. If we're talking about parking spots lost, this huge number of parking spots gained. We also were able to remove some parklets. Some businesses had two parklets like fills, and we were able to remove that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to. Okay. So a couple of questions for staff. I think enforcement to me is the biggest key here. And I'm going to approve staff's recommendation. I'm going to ask I'm going to vote in favor of staff's recommendation and I'm going to ask my colleagues to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I do want to make a motion, and I know the city attorney's on the line. I'm going to turn over to him in just a minute for Art Sanchez. I'm not sure if he's in here or on the line, but I do want to talk a little bit about every Parklet permit committee has to follow certain'",
        "'speaker_4': 'guidelines and standards, and there are good neighbor policies that are outlined here that basically say any violations or the permit can be revised, the conditions can be revised if any complaints are received and the permit may be revoked.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there is a nuisance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Situation. So I want to turn it over to the city attorney, Mr. Sanchez, and ask him if you can explain to us what that process is, because I would like to have a report back within 30 days that highlights what that process is and what efforts we've made to outreach to the community, what that processes for a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'permanent revocation of a temporary parklet for a violator of the good neighbor policy. So, Mr. Sanchez, can I ask you to explain that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly. Councilwoman Pryce. So what would happen is we would have to have documentation of whatever the violation is, and it would have to be it would be done by venue task force at this point. And once we receive the documentation of the violation, we would reach out to the business owner, have them make somewhat immediate corrections, and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'if those corrections aren't made, we would move forward with removal of the parklet. Now that's you know, it's kind of in general in terms of the removal, assuming that violations exist and violations aren't corrected in a timely manner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then we would post a notice providing the business with 72 hours to basically remove all items that had been collected at the parklet. They have an opportunity from. I believe, five days after the posting of the notice to request a hearing to appeal the removal of the parklet, the parklet would still be removed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The appeal would occur after the fact, and then we would just have that hearing and make a determination about the removal. And that is generally the process. If you have any questions like I've tried, answer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So my time is up, so I'm going to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Take.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You back up. For it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. So, Mr. Sanchez, is there any way that we can document that process so that residents are aware of it? Because I know that residents have called the police in regards to some parklets and feel like they haven't had much of a process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So is there any way to document that process and then outreach it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Um. Yes, I guess we could have it done through a combination of public works and the venue task force can come up with a written process that outlines that it can post it. I guess it would be on the Public Works website.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, that sounds great. And my office will also help in getting the process out to the community once we have a process. And I think within that write up, there should be some sort of clear identification of what that threshold is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it just a simple complaint is a sustained violation. You know, a lot of times neighbors will call, for example, of a good neighbor policies, talk a lot about noise and loitering. So what happens is when they call that in, oftentimes code enforcement is not in a position to respond at midnight or 11 p.m. or even 9:30'",
        "'speaker_4': 'p.m.. That's just those are not hours that code enforcement is able to respond. So then the resident is really left without recourse. And so I'd like, you know, a call to the police department and a police response to to qualify as one of the documented complaints that was either substantiated or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just nothing. I'm not making a motion as to how you effectuate this this process, but just a suggestion for when you do write it up that it would be good for residents to have some clarity. So with that, I do want to highlight just a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unless, Mr. Sanchez unless there's anything else you want to add.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In response to the talking points that I just raised.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But, yes, so in terms of the violations, there would have to be some investigation that would be conducted. That investigation would include reviewing whatever calls for service that are for that particular location. And so that information would be reviewed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That would be some of the things that we would look into to confirm that the activity or the violation is occurring at that particular business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. And that takes me to slide number six. There's a bullet point that says Parklets on minor side streets will no longer be allowed in cases where there are multiple documented violations.

We had three stakeholder engagement meetings in August and September. These are some of the stakeholder comments from the tenant stakeholder meeting held on August 25th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These are some from August 26. This is the property owners stakeholder comments. Property owners were concerned about a lack of data. And they wanted to see substantial more and more clearly defined. The third meeting included both groups and comments were similar.'",

And this slide provides some of the key ideas and comments from the survey. As with the stakeholder meetings, there were 13 points of view expressed in the survey results.'",

We do show that there's 879 permits that appear eligible for substantial remodels between March 2020 March 2021. And that number is similar to 2018 and 19.

        "'speaker_6': 'And that includes revise the definition to require time to vacate 60 days instead of 30 days. Revise the definition and more clearly define what work is qualified as substantial remodel. Establish a civil fine of up to $15,000, payable by landlords to tenants.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And then we're also asking that you adopt an ordinance amending the Chapter 8.1 or two to extend the prohibition on termination of tenancies due to this provision. That concludes my presentation. Thank you. Thank you. At this point, we'll go to public comment.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'I have participated in every step of this process since early 2021. Tonight, we are discussing remedies for a problem that has yet to be supported by data. The common theme throughout this process is lack of data. This vote will have an effect for years to come on housing investments in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Currently, we pay relocation fee, which we are open to discussing in future based on inflation and other other matters. Substantial years. Why don't we have a box to check when we're doing a permit application? We can track tenant relocations with the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There is a distinct distinction with a difference between an eviction and canceling Alys. The state clearly defines nobody has any ambiguity of what a substantial remodel is, and we know it when we see it. It's ripping out plumbing, redoing electrical, and keeping up with our aging housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Throughout this process, we have not heard one example of a tenant displaced under something that is not covered under current state law. And if it was done outside of state law, there are remedies available to them today and they should be held accountable.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I thank you. Honorable Mayor and City Council. My name is Matthew Buck. I'm with the California Apartment Association. The staff report indicates no complaints have been received by the department on this issue zero. It's not because the city can't collect the data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's easy to field complaints in the existing response base system. It's purely because there are no complaints regarding illegal upgrades. The Tenant Protection Act outlines specific criteria regarding substantial remodels to address an aging housing stock. The provisions in the law are not a loophole, but designed to encourage the maintenance and upkeep of the state's apartment homes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Over 70% of the housing in Long Beach was built before 1970. Your buildings need rehabilitation. Unnecessary regulations will deter needed upgrades and increase the cost to obtain housing. There's no evidence to support additional regulations are needed. We ask that the item be received and filed.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We've had enough in 2021, to be honest. You've also heard from everybody from the landlord side of things. The staff is basically figured out. There's been no there's been no data to substantiate what we've been discussing. None. So we have nothing factually to really fall back on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Number two, as said earlier, the state already has law about what a substantial remodel is. If you want to codify that for local here in the city, an ordinance by all means. But the state already has a law on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As mentioned also, we have a very old housing stock here in Long Beach. What are we going to do to incentivize small property owners to basically come forward and improve their property? How are we going to do that if we're going to continue to hit them with exorbitant cost to make this all happen?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Finally, the thing that bothers me probably the most is the cost of a RFP program. You heard earlier it's roughly two I think I heard 4 million. Eventually, development services, if they found the ability to pay for that, is going to pass that on to property owners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can't pass that on to tenants. That's not a pass through costs. With 1482, you have a 5% raise increase annually plus CPI. You won't be able to pass through those additional costs. Keep that in mind. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next to Zach, then. Greasier than Maggie.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You've had a lot of. You've got your glasses. Yes. Hi. My name is Zack and I'm a landlord. And I just want to tell you my story, which is this pandemic has basically run me into the ground. I'm having to work, too.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I had to go back to school there and work two jobs to keep hold on to what I have. So when you guys add additional cost on us, it's not something that we can just afford. And just as a side note, my tenant is so I'm the government owes me $44,000 in unpaid rent and my tenant wants'",
        "'speaker_9': '$10,000 bribe cash to cooperate with it because you guys put that stipulation that you have to cooperate. So I'm fighting like hell to hang on to what I have and adding more cost to us, more burdens is hard enough.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Fall. I mean, I feel for these guys out here with the no eviction signs, but you guys have let 10,000 low cost units go away. You guys have let a bunch of Section eight go away. You guys, this is not a fault from the landlords.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this, for the most part, impacts only small landlords. And, you know, all you're going to get is a takeover from BlackRock, who's not gonna listen to you guys, all of them. They're gonna come in with their fancy lawyers and there's no chance for anybody then.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm asking you guys to reject this altogether. And lastly, when I can't afford when somebody can't afford to pay somebody to live somewhere else, they're just gonna start ripping out asbestos walls with that with the people still living there.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Officials is data. You know, my question is, why isn't the city collecting the data that is related to the majority of our residents who happen to be renters? 60% of the residents of this city are renters. In neighborhoods where I live and close to where I live.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Renters are 90% of the renters. So there are entire huge areas of our city where the residents are renters. And they are here telling you again and again. That there is suffering. There are loopholes in this ordinance. We're glad that we made the progress we have, but we have shared with you specific changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Modifications.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That are doable. So if you're going to put it on our shoulders as renters to fight for fair housing, then you need to make these changes. So when we go to court, we have a chance to win. That's what we're asking for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You make changes so we can get past expired. Have to go to court.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next, Jordan. When Karen resigned, Karen was Rick Jordan. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Jordan Wynn, resident of District two and member of the Housing Justice Coalition. I am here in support, strong support of adopting option one, removing removing substantial role models, a just cause for eviction, establishing a renovation administrative program administered by the Development Services Department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is what our tenants really need, and it's a common sense policy that other municipalities have already adopted. Liana put it best We need to start collecting the data, but truly, do you want the data? Here we are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Living, breathing data. Here in the audience we are complaining. We are the tenants who have been fighting and continuing the hard work of attending the past sessions, of telling you these stories again and again. Again. How many times you have to hear that tenants need help in the city and it's not without insistence from advocates to collect'",
        "'speaker_3': 'data in our city. As the report said, 879 multi-unit developments filed for substantial rehabilitation, meaning that thousands potentially of individuals and families affected. Let's be honest, this data issue goes beyond tonight's decision. Long Beach needs to act proactively to aid tenants who've been coming here and telling you they need help for years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does the city want to remain blind to the issues of the majority of its population without the support of its city and the law behind them? Tenants are scared to report, often feeling powerless and don't know their rights.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And of course, landlords won't be reporting something that they're doing under the table. Who shows up? Tenants show up because housing is a human right. The cost of this program pales in comparison to the need that we have in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'But we wanted.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'That have had to move out of state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That used to come to the senior center and they're now all gone. So I know at least 40 the people that I ate lunch with had to move out of state because they had.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unreasonable increases in their rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have to collect the data. We know that landlords, not all landlords are bad, but there's a lot that aren't good. So and this causes undue stress on seniors and probably have cost lives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So Harvey's next. And then. And then. Excuse me, Karen was Rick and then Harvey. But before you go, Karen, why you went to make your way? I want to call it the last five speakers Michael Lapointe, Daniel Sherwood, Mary Duong, Winston de Laurier and Vilma.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, so, Karen, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for having me here. I love you. Nice. I was here a couple months ago, and I wanted to, first of all, say a thank you with these ordinance amendments. And I hope most of them get taken.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Four voted for. I have a little difficulty sometimes with my words. And so please excuse excuse me. One of the things I wanted to talk about was, you know, it's what's talked about if major. You know, increasing, they're making them better and so forth and so on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's what our owner wants to do. But they're not doing it to make it nice for us. They're making it more expensive so that other people come in after us. And as much as $1,000 more for the same place I've been living where I live for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And my very nice landlord. Except that she did. She got older and she sold it. So now a company holds it and they do not have the same heart. And they as she did. And she now.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I'll finish your sentence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She occasionally would increase the rent, but not every year. Our new deck per people are there two years and I've had to over $100 each. Thank you. Increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next is Harvey Hope and Christine Schachter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hello. My name's Harvey Holt. I work 56 hours a week. I'm 37. Excuse me. You have to put on an hour. I thought I'd take it off right here. I live with my parents until this march. And I lived them in a one bedroom.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In a bedroom with my wife and my son also that I could save money to buy a property. And I bought a four unit property here in Long Beach. I went to Centennial High in Compton. And what I learned from being a property owner is not always about all you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You increasing things to make money, you're increasing things to improve it, to keep it, to keep up with inflation. So like, for example, the place up by I did a one bedroom for me and my wife and kids are moving into contractors wanting a $40,000 to remodel a one bedroom, 600 square foot apartment like f the F'",

And she only she only pays 900. But I'll replace the windows, I replaced the plumbing, and I didn't have to displace anyone to replace the windows and plumbing'",
        "'speaker_9': '. But if I had to redo that unit, which eventually I will like, I have to recoup that cost. So I think. Don't you think, oh, we want to put people out. No, it's like, yo, I work 56 hours a week.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think you have to let me at least recoup my money.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next is Christine Schachter, then Michael Lapointe, then Daniel Sharwood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And 30 $200.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For 30 $200. Thank you.'",

Representing about 13,000 members here locally in August, our coalition submitted a written request to the.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next is Michael Lapointe, then Daniel Sherwood, the married one. I don't know. Okay. We don't see Michael. Next is Daniel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, City Council. My name is Daniel Sherwood. I've been a resident of Long Beach for 35 years. So what I know about Long Beach is I love the city, and I know that the city has prided itself on diversity and quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I also know that as we have an awful homeless situation, mental illness and violence on our streets. And we have a lack of affordable rents. We too, went through the same thing. A company came in and bought our 27 unit and a 24 unit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We share a pool. The first year, they evicted 90% of the residents in Obispo for substantial remodel. So the rest of us that hung tight. We were on pins and needles. We never knew whether we were going to get to stay or whether we're going to get to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's that's not a great way to live. And so I concur with everybody here tonight. It's an awful place to be in. So what did we get when they revamped these buildings and made them high end apartment buildings?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We went from 1000 to 20 to 50 for a one bedroom. We went from 1250 to 20 to 50 for a two bedroom or 2450 for a two bedroom. Our pool we had the heater was taken out, the security system was removed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the elevators, they're not painted. The maintenance is awful and your time is up. It is deplorable. Thank you. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I myself was impacted by substantial remodel or eviction when I was in graduate school. I remember that my landlord never had a conversation with me regarding compensation for relocation expenses. It was stressful to be in graduate school and to work at the same time, and it was more stressful and more overwhelming, like when you lost your affordable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'housing. And I can imagine families with children going through that right now during this pandemic. I think we need to address that. There is an unequal power relationship between landlords and tenants. Substantial remodel as a just cost makes tenants more vulnerable to eviction at any moment and be at the mercy of their landlords.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this power imbalance creates the conditions for power abuse, as we have heard in many testimonies tonight. So to shift this power imbalance, I believe that option one is the best solution because it will remove substantial remodel as a just cause and also it will provide oversight to landlords so that responsible repairs can be made and also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'affordable housing is ensure for tenants. In my Christian tradition, the prophets teach that God identifies yourself with the vulnerable in society. So I ask that the CD Council we vote on option one to support our tenants as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next is Winston then Vilma.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, folks. My name is Winston Deloria. I'm live in the six councilwoman Sara's district. Just have a few things to say. First of all, I strongly urge the council to adopt option one in the event that option two is selected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would very strongly urge even any any decision is made. I believe the moratorium should remain in place until it can be implemented. I think to do otherwise just is inviting landlords to evict tenants preemptively. Secondly, I believe the 60 day notice well, I actually believe that was increased from 90 day notice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that's a good move. Relocation assistance, I believe, should be increased to match the L.A. County guidelines. And then the the other point I want to make here is just very briefly, we're not just talking about individuals, right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you're talking about individual families. You know, we hear a lot about the free market solution here. The free market solution to this is poor people. Well, the kids get roommates with, you know, four people to a studio apartment and working families moved to Victorville.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think our communities have a right to exist and we're going to fight for that right to exist. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'We want the eviction moratorium to be extended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a serious lawyer, the suspension.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the look on the substantial remodeling is closed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean. Yes, almost.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Canceled the dance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Performances.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Scenes of this were the first they told us they gave us a notice that we had to pay $100 parking. I mean, I've seen parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Almost, but do not say well enough.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or do not no check.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, by.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Threatening us that if we park the car for a few minutes or even overnight, they will take the car away from us. And then what has to happen? Know you can help out another guy. We beg you. Please pay attention to us and do something for us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment. We'll go to Councilwoman Allen and the maker of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I want to first start by thanking Oscar, Christopher Patrick and everyone at DVS for their hard work and insights on this issue. This item today is exactly what we asked for back in July, and I really appreciate all the time and the outreach that was spent on putting this together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to recognize my co-sponsor on the original, original item, Councilwoman Sorrow and the Cosigners Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilwoman Zendejas for their partnership and support. And we definitely wouldn't be here today without all of you. I also want to take a moment to recognize all the tenant and property groups and individuals who reached out to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'my office and participated in the process. With the city and voice their questions and concerns. So thank you for your opinions. Thank you for your experiences. All of this really matters to me. So. Diving into this item. I appreciate the policy options presented today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My staff recommendation, I would like to pursue option one and I do support creation of a rap. But due to the city's fiscal situation, it doesn't seem possible at this time. Creating a way to manage projects was the purpose of the initial policy directive, and we still need to find a way that allows for units to be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'upgraded without displacing residents. But current budget projections will not make this immediately feasible. We need more time and planning to identify and allocate the kind of funding for Iraq. This option also takes a very long time to implement, and it would take at least one year or longer to develop the program and hire staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there are actions that we can take here now that will make a difference similar to the SAS recommendation. I support moving forward with a hybrid solution that contains option three and elements of option two with modifications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are things that we can do today at lower costs to the city and landlords increasing their relocation assistance to 4500, it would be very beneficial. This would provide a lot of relief for residents. And this figure is significantly less than the L.A. County relocation amounts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do support this option, and I'd like this to be 4500 or two months for rent, whichever is greater. Is that something that we can do?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. That's a change we could make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then from option two, I support, including numbers three, four and five and removing numbers one and two. So establishing a fine for landlords who violate our city's just cause ordinance, I think, is a strong deterrent against bad actors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Additionally, providing a 90 day notice to vacate also helps tenants better manage and remodel a better manager remodel process. I'm very excited about point number four, particularly the data collection aspect of it. I think that it's just what we need to better understand the extent of substantial remodel related displacement in our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like to make the motion and move forward with a hybrid solution that contains a modified option. Three. And points three, four and five from option two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next thing I saw, a cup of jersey.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are also a few things that I'd like to request in addition to that. Could we include language and option three that clarifies the relocation benefit disbursement information? Is it a lump sum or will payments be divided and when will the payments be issued?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we can include all of those items. But if you have specific direction as to what your preferences are, you would need to let us know because I don't think we have a specific staff recommendation on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On exactly how the disbursement works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I definitely would like to hear from my colleagues. And then I do have a call. I do have one last question. I know what's going to be lost. But we heard that there's been no data on substantial remodel evictions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know in your report you say while the claims are valid, it is possible that the displacements are concentrated in certain buildings. So you're saying they're likely valid, but but why is there no data on this effort on this?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we believe one of the most important things in front of council is to create a mandatory reporting requirement for a substantial remodel. Today, there is no reporting requirement. So what happens is a landlord within their rights issues a non-judicial, you know, notice to vacate a 60 day notice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if the tenant complies with the notice that's not forwarded to the city, it's not forwarded to the courts. It's it's not shared with any third party. So it's not that there is no data. It's that there is not sufficient data that the city is party to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because we don't currently have any right to that data or a way to access that data. So what we did was look at indirect evidence. We looked at building permits. There was some information about, you know, sheriffs enforced evictions, but that does not those are indirect indicators.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's not the direct information which we don't have today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next is Councilwoman Ciro.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks, Vice Mayor. I also want to reiterate my thanks to staff for their hard work in bringing this item back and as well as to all of our advocates and tenants and property owners and advocates on their comment and feedback on this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I will second councilmember and I want to thank Councilmember Allen for her leadership on this item. And we'll second it. But I have some friendly amendments, some friendly to make on the motion. I like to make a friendly to adding option 2.1.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think revising the definition of the statute remodeled include work that would require a tenant to vacant for at least 60 days as opposed to the 30. Is a strong policy that allows good faith landlord to renovate their property at their discretion and provide some protection for tenants as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'd like to hear from my colleagues on this. And the other is I would like to amend option 2.32 rather saying fine up to 15,000 is to start at 15,000 and to strike out intentionally. And lastly, while I understand that option one at the moment is physically, physically not possible, but I like to ask that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get a report back with a year's worth of data, a substantial remodel related eviction. I think that this will give us a better sense on what the situation is in Long Beach, and that the report also include possible additional resources for funding the wrap in updated cost figures as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that concludes my comment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That was a request for three friendlies. Did you want to respond now? Do you want to wait?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, if I could, I wait and just hear from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to thank everyone who came out tonight on both sides of the issue. I did listen to and really took some notes on some of the things that were said. But when Karen and I don't I don't want to say her last name incorrectly, but caring who came to the dais and really talked about'",
        "'speaker_5': 'how her small landlord sold and a big company bought the building. I think that more and more of that is happening because when I talk to people who have the opportunity to invest and potentially keep an original property and move and buy a property and then rent out their old property or invest and buy a multi-unit, they're'",
        "'speaker_5': 'very discouraged because of the complexities of being a landlord. And with each and every day, it gets more and more complex and there's more and more struggles for them to know and understand. And more things that could put them under and make their investment a just a money pit of frustration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You already have the risks of a tenant not being able to pay rent and or a tenant or a natural disaster like we've had where you would be put in a position to not receive rent for long periods of time where you may still be required to pay that mortgage and go through the processes and paperwork to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'get those requirements. So and while I'm very supportive of a solution that makes sense for all. I think that one of the things that we do need to talk about as a community is that if we want. Individuals who live locally to own the properties that our neighbors are renting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Instead of these big companies and corporations. We need to talk about what we can do to make it easy on them. Because the types of people who don't raise rent are your neighbors. When your neighbors own the property you live in, they're the ones who are the best landlords because they're the ones who live in Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and they care about you. These big companies aren't aren't the way of the way we want to go. And so I think with each policy, I don't know if there's a way to differentiate who the policies apply to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think that the best case scenario for us as a city is that the larger percentage of the housing stock that's owned locally by neighbors, the better position all our renters would be in. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for the discussion and thanks for everyone who came out especially. I want to thank staff for undergoing this huge process. And Patrick, you've done amazing work on it, so I appreciate that. I appreciate the comments from my colleagues and I support I'm going to support this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Councilwoman Allen's motion, I'm not sure about the friendlies that the one that I personally don't want to see in there is 2.1. But again, I want to hear my colleagues thoughts on that. But that wasn't part of the initial motion by Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just I don't believe it's necessary based on the staff presentation that we have received and some of the areas of of. Input that staff has highlighted from the community meetings. But other than that, I'm supportive of the motion and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilmember Surana. Thank you. I have a follow up on Councilwoman Sorrells friendly, and I'm not sure if that's been accepted yet, but I'm all for getting the data as was referenced by everyone here tonight. But my concern is the cost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if staff knows how we would pay for that, I see. I think there's potentially a large concern that either be borne by the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or the landlords through fees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do you have any immediate reaction to that? So that's not our intention. Council Member So we have to work through some security issues, but theoretically this would be a Google form that landlords would have a log in to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They would log in, note the location, address the unit number, the landlord's contact information and upload a copy of the notice and that would fulfill their reporting requirement. So if their cost is not zero, but we would anticipate it not to be a substantial cost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I think I understand that answer, that we could lessen the cost due to technology, but we would still have cost in notifying landlords or through any program like this. There are some costs. But I think I'm hearing you say that is not substantial to what you're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's that's correct. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Arango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Rates there in you know, for purposes of transparency, I have met with people regarding the the issue regarding the this item here. And I looked at it and asked, well, isn't there like a fourth option that could be together?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I guess the fourth option is sort of their presenta right now, as Councilmember Allard has put together in terms of putting items two and three together. Obviously, we had a budget presentation earlier today. Option one would not be feasible at all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, it's just impossible for us to be able to finance any kind of new program through the city if it's, you know, worth $2 million or even more. I do support the friendly that were brought forward recently with the council member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that getting data is very important and I think staff would be able to work it out. And so I am very supportive of the friendlies as well to have, you know, the make of the motion would accept the friendly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perfectly good with that as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I know I was a little torn on this particular item from the very beginning because I didn't feel like the data was there to actually support the need for a policy. But after hearing from public comment, there's obviously a great deal of concern in the community about this this issue, which obviously we all hear behind'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this day. I think our city staff, we have an interest in keeping people housed. Is the morals, the ethical thing to do? One point that came out earlier from staff's report is 80% of our housing stock in the city was is over 30 years old.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's something that that's a fact that we can't be lost on. We know that there as a result, there will be investments. We should be encouraging property owners to invest in their properties because we don't want to be a city that encourages blight or subpar living conditions for our residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That said, I do think that this this item or this information that's on the floor is is a balanced motion. It makes a lot of sense. I do have questions about the friendly in terms of 2.3. And the question is more for the city attorney in terms of does it start at 15,000 or does it max at'",
        "'speaker_2': '15,000 or. Is it is it incumbent upon this body right now to set set that that that that that ceiling or floor for record it is councilmember out and you'd be giving. Future Superior Court judges guidance on what they can and can't do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think, as everyone knows currently as written, the fines for intentional violation could be anywhere between zero and 15,000. The friendly would force a judge to levy a fine of 15,000 and up. And as the friendly, at least I heard there was no maximum limit on on a fine that a judge might impose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's purely within your discretion to do it either way. And can can staff give us some some direction as to how we arrived at that at number two. As a as a floor or as a max. Was that an arbitrary number or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not a legally required number to that. To that extent, it may be somewhat arbitrary, but I'm guessing, and I don't think any of us can quite recall where it came from, we probably lifted it from another ordinance somewhere in the state that imposes a similar penalty for similar conduct, but I can't say for sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, I'm supportive of the motion and I'm I'm a little a little ambivalent on on 2.3 the friendly but I. We'll be open to hear from the maker of the motion and my colleagues on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Zendaya's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Allen and Councilwoman Sorrell, for bringing this very, very important item forward and for your leadership on this. I know it's been a long road to getting here, and I just want to make sure that I let everyone know how important you are to this process from both sides of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'coin. I just want to tell you how much we appreciate you coming out here and voicing your opinions and speaking for your community. So especially on this very, very important item. Myself as a renter, I'm always looking out for for renters to be able to live in a safe and and clean and updated environment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's always going to be important to me as a renter. I absolutely support the item that Councilwoman Allen has brought forward. I think that Councilmember Warren said it right. This is option number four, kind of like. So I think that a combination of that is really good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Another thing that I have heard from a lot of my residents is that the need for maybe asking for friendly in extending the moratorium that we have right now until this ordinance is is complete. And I'm hoping that you might be able to consider that and hoping that this ordinance can come back in 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have to go to you because you're cute, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess my question is for Steph. I understand the idea of like a Google form, but one of the things that I think is really important is how are we going to notify landlords of the requirement to use the Google form?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If no one knows, they need to do it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. So we do have a productive relationship with the various apartment owners associations, whether that's the California Apartment Owners Association, Small Property Owners Association and others. So that would be the starting point, not the ending point, but that would be the starting point for communicating with landlords.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then those that have email addresses associated with their business license. We would also be providing them a notification in that way. So that would be the starting point. But we would find whatever additional ways we could communicate with them, barring substantial cost.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What percentage of those that have business licenses have email addresses associated?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't have that information.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then furthermore, to be a landlord in the city, you don't need to have a business license, if only if it's of a certain number of units or more. Is that accurate? So just so we're clear, a large percentage of landlords might not be notified.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's a concern if we want really good data. So I guess I would request that there's an option for a tenant to put in information that then we would be able to reach the landlord and get additional information so that if a landlord is unaware that a tenant could at least bring it to our attention, just give'",
        "'speaker_5': 'more complete data. But I recognize that that creates another set of challenges. Just some just some food for thought. I'm supportive of the item on the floor as it stands. I don't know that I could be open to the friendlies that have come before.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would love to pass something tonight with the support of the full council. I think Councilman Allen has done a considerable amount of work on this, and I think that the motion that she brought is very thoughtful and I would be supportive of that, and I hope that we get to see that on the floor as a'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I'll add my comment before going back to Councilwoman Allen. We've come a long, long way.

And I just want to remind folks that, you know, it was a couple of years ago, you know, and I've been participating'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in council meetings since 2010, and I remember the downtown planning fight and all of those things. Long Beach is in a significantly different place where there was no relocation assistance. And I think Andrew mentioned going back to home for the holidays made significant progress.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There won't be, based on the comments of the council, what you hear an option one is not feasible from a financial standpoint. The council is not ready to go there. And and I think it's important to note that there are what's been presented in front of us does offer significant advancement in terms of, you know, relocation assistance'",
        "'speaker_6': 'increased in terms of, you know, the the fine you know, we've talked about slumlords in the city. We've talked about it. There's a big distinct difference between big companies or small companies or slumlords or people who are just trying to be good landlords.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And having that fine, I think, is a clear distinction. If you break the law, there is a penalty. And there are you know, there are good things that are here. So while it is not heading toward option number one, I think what Councilwoman Allen is presenting, I think it's balance and will continue the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And those are my thoughts. I see the city attorney is keyed up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Thank you. Vice Mayor, just before it goes back to Councilmember Allen, there's a couple of questions that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She had asked a long time ago now that I want to close the loop on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The first is actually first is something that councilmembers and day has just said. I think it was a friendly to extend the prohibition on evictions until we get some final action on these changes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's always been my intention. And in fact, that I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Brought back this extension on the prohibition, you know, without any specific direction from council to do so. Because I thought in July it was pretty clear that the intention of the council was put a moratorium on evictions until we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Take final action. So for all the members of the audience and behind the dais, there's been a lot of confusion about that. And I apologize for the role I played. February 28th is an arbitrary date. If we can't get something done by February.'",
        "'speaker_2': '28th, it's my full intention to bring back an extension.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But February 28th, I think, gives us plenty of time to get something done. And it looks like consensus is building right now. So I intend to bring something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Back for formal adoption by you all behind the dais well in advance of that date. And at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would bring back something then.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I just thank you, my colleagues, for. For all of your feedback. So that's great to hear that, um, that, that could be extended until we figure all of this out. The moratorium. I'm all about collecting data. And, and then with regards to Council member Austin's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ask about 2.3. I think the $15,000 is I think we should have a have a. A number on that. I don't think that there should be no limit. And so I like to keep that as it is then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it sounds like this is the big question is, is 2.1. So I'm hearing yes and no. And so I guess, councilman. Sorry, my ask would be, do you want to make a substitute motion? And we vote on that outside of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but I think that I'd like to keep my motion the way that it is. And then we can if we want to make a substitute motion outside of that and vote, then I'm okay with that, too.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Yeah, that's exciting. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Counsel, just so we're all clear in terms of the report, that would be it. It would come slightly more than a year later because we would wait until the ordinance actually became effective and then an entire year of data was collected and then some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Amount of time to report back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. When you said a number of friendlies. Except that I only have that there's one or maybe two. So if you don't mind overstated, the motion on the floor is to adopt sub sections three, four and five from option two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To adopt options three or four or $500 for relocation payment or two months rent, whichever is greater. Report back staff is to report back in a little over a year with the first year's worth of data.

If you donate, if you recall, one of the main selling points of A to a city is the potential for cost savings for customers, SDF costs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And last year the reality is that the rate margins for cars has been shrinking over the past few years to the point where now several cars now have rates higher than those charged by the private utility for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The best comparative example is the rates of Clean Power Alliance, which is shown on the screen currently. If Long Beach had joined CPA, a typical Long Beach resident would pay about 6 to 7% higher than they do today as a customer of Southern California Edison.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Importantly, for our most vulnerable low income residents, they would have seen a 2 to 8% increase in their monthly electric bills. Something that's often heard is that customers of some of the company s and do not have a choice for green power and a CCAR would offer that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's not exactly correct. If you look at the screen, a customer of Southern California Edison today has the same three options that they do with a Clean Power Alliance. They have the base option. They have a 50% minimum green power, and then they have 100% renewable.'",

We want to make sure that we point out that it's not necessary for the city to form to realize the city's environmental goals.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Additionally, Long Beach's climate action and Adaptation Plan is heavily reliant upon the success of Edison meeting its own environmental goals. As such, it's both critical and logical for the city to take advantage of the long term relationship and maximize the cleaner benefits that can best be achieved by working closely with Southern California Edison.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At City Council Directions. City staff has worked for the past year with Edison to create a new Clean Pathway Community Partnership. This partnership with Edison was discussed in detail last month in a presentation to City Council, explaining how it is focused on the transition to clean energy, utilizing and promoting technology innovations and expanding the electrification of transportation'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Also, as mentioned earlier, Edison currently provides two options to Long Beach residents who desire greener power. The city is committed to working with Southern California Edison to get that information out to residents to try to increase the number of customers taking advantage of those greener options.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This will help the city in its efforts to reach the CAP goals. I'll turn back over to Bob Del. As staff has mentioned before, there are still major regulatory issues that are currently and will continue to impact the financial competitiveness of cars listed on this slide or three of those issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Exit fees known as PCI charges along with. Except he's known as CIA charges a charge by the CCAR customers every month. Resource adequacy requirements that increase supply reliability, which will significantly impact costs paid by CCAR beginning in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the requirements under SB 350 that we require that 65% of a six energy contracts be terms of ten years or more. This alone would equate to a Long Beach CCAR incurring hundreds of millions or even billions of financial obligations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In any event, the city council still wanted to pursue a CPA. Staff was asked to have a governance study prepared that evaluated the three options. Those three options discussed in detail on the staff report and the actual governance study is attached to the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll just highlight these very quickly. There was a stand alone enterprise that we were asked to evaluate. The city maintains the full flexibility, responsibility for delivering all policies and procedures, and the CCAR would be tailored to the response of the city stakeholders and constituents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And those are the cons. The city assumes all risks, liability and cost, including a significant startup costs of 15 million associated with operating a CPA. And there's no protection for the financial assets of the city under this option.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Creating a joint power authority proves the city shares responsibility with other agencies, protects the assets of the city, and distributes the risks and costs with the participating agencies. Industry in the GTA. Under the Cons with two or more parties, as you would assume the decision making is allocated among the agencies, management independence is diminished and many times'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the objectives of the participating agencies may not be aligned in setting priorities for local generation economic development and programs. Supporting programs. Adjoining a CETA or in this case we evaluated joining the Clean Power Lines. Obviously, a shared responsibility among participating municipalities is one of the pros, protects the financial assets of the cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's quicker to implement all of the cons. We would be just one of 33 participating municipalities with only one vote. Little to no ability to direct any priorities for rate setting as well as local generation, economic development and support programs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that should the city ever decide to exit from that JPA or from CPA, we would likely be responsible for any future power commitments that the CPA purchased on behalf of the city of Long Beach. Our community outreach is critical.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is a critical component in the formation of a CCE. The COVID 19 pandemic restrictions on gatherings have made it problematic to have any meaningful community outreach events. As such, this outreach has been deferred for the time being.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the recommended actions that staff will present this evening is for them. Do not take any action at this time to initiate the creation of a CCE in any form for Long Beach. City staff will continue to monitor the California energy market and regulatory environment as they relate to case.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If any substantive CCR developments occur. Staff will report back to City Council with those developments to reevaluate the creation of a CAA for Long Beach and then the fourth continue the partnership partnership efforts with FCC to increase efforts to better promote green energy options that are currently available for residents and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This concludes our presentation and we're available for any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Come to me, Ringo. If a motion received file.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yesterday when I think it's time for a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thorough report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On this, I think that obviously we are that the jury is still out on the benefits of jury. Okay. So I think that we need more opportunity to study it further. And I move that we receive a part of this report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kathryn Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A second emotion. I think, again, we were asked for a feasibility study. The feasibility study has come back and it's pretty clear to me that at this point it is not prudent or feasible or wise for our city to move forward in this regard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do say that our feasibility study and the work done by our staff, I'm encouraged because we heard a pretty comprehensive report from from Southern California Edison just a few weeks ago that I believe that had we not move forward with this, we may not have seen the type of advancements in clean energy from from from Edison'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in that regard. And so our actions are actually moving the needle. And so I think the council should be applauded for that. And I want to thank staff for their work on this important item. Perhaps it comes back in the future to see as, as as advancements with CCS are worked out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it doesn't look like this would be in the interest of our or our residents as ratepayers. And for me, I'm really concerned about those who are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Always, always.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Concerned about those who are on fixed incomes. I do not want to add to the cost of their their utilities, but by taking a risk at this point. And so I support this item to receive involved. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Awesome. And thank you. I also want to thank staff for their hard work on this. And I also think all of the advocates that have been pushing us to get greener, I love that. And we can clearly see from the last few years that there is a burning desire for faster climate action in our community and local'",
        "'speaker_0': 'control is a motivating factor. But there are concerns as well given the Riverside CCAR bankruptcy and lingering unpaid balances by utility customers statewide. While I do not believe that the city's fiscal position at this time is strong enough to assume the risk of creating SCCA or JPA, this may not be the case and years from now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So staff, please continue to monitor the health of other CCS and the AC territory. The PC, the PUC actions, including any adjustments to the CIA and the green energy ratios and the CS portfolio. That's a lot of acronyms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Additionally, I think that continual monitoring is proper decision tonight and we need s c to come to the table and be, you know, a bolder, more active partner. Long Beach is is definitely important to see. And if we're going to delay considerations of a CC at this time, then we need to come to the table to come'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to the table in a more serious, a serious way. Let's make Long Beach, you know, a model community for electrification and zero emission, industrial, commercial and residential and transportation technologies. I look forward to working with my colleagues and SC and to step up our game in a new year and going forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for city staff and I just have a couple of questions for you. Can you share what the timeline looks like for getting city accounts into 100% green energy?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Excuse me. So you're asking if we took all 20 city accounts? We actually did that back in late nineties. We purchased electricity for all 3000 city accounts on the open market. It was when deregulation first happened in the electric industry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We turned those back on workers, on the companies, and because that failed, not with us, but with the state, and we could look into that again. There's obviously a cost to go green power. It is increase. I know we looked at just for the water treatment plant it was we transferred to 100% green power, I believe it'",
        "'speaker_6': 'was about $300,000 a year increase in costs just for that one account. So it's quite expensive, but we can look into that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And just add on to that question. We have included that in our cap. I believe that was one of our long term goals through our cap, it was a several million dollar budget hit. So if I remember it was in the probably 3 to $5 million range and it was going to be phased in over the next'",
        "'speaker_3': 'several years. We can work to get you an actual date of when those go into the financial projections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then can I kindly request with any future updates? With regards to SB 350, I was recently informed that the Clean Energy Project Revenue bonds in Northern California successfully generated like 1.5 billion and proceeds for three participating CCAS.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can you also look into that and how they work and include that in any future updates as well, please?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then if it's okay with a member of the motion, there's just a couple of things that I like to add. So first, I continue to monitor the landscape of CCS and AC service territory and then report back next year, you know, similar to what you did at tonight's presentation and then bring back as part of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clean Pathways Partnership with Southern California Edison Edison. The following clear goals and I'm happy to work on this, you know, and in committee or I can work at work here in the full diocese. But clear annual signup goals for S's Green Rate Program based on a robust Southern California Edison marketing and Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then to direct identification of our largest and worse to use energy users from Etsy so that we can work with them and SC to reduce the energy usage in line with our cap. Okay. And then three increase generation and use of renewable on city and institutional sites, including Lobby, City College, Long Beach State and Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unified School District. And then last. Any innovative pilot projects for local EV charging at all income levels and grid resiliency solar generation in ways that could help reduce the urban heat island effects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Early and we're already working on quite a few of those with Southern California Edison as we speak. And so we'll be able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And so what to make of the motion except those friendlies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, yeah. Also unclear because we're not really taking any action on this report that they received on file. But I think that you're giving instructions, I think, to staff to do some additional.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Study of this whole thing. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Member Your Honor, you're correct that the friendlies would add.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additional requirement to receive and follow this motion. And I'd like to bring back a report in a year, along with the other items that she'd asked them to look at. So I would. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to comment on a couple of quick things. I am really impressed with the way in which our city staff have really worked hard to ensure that our residents have options within the system that we're in today through Edison that give them the option to use 100% renewable energy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When I read the report, one of the things that's of concern is that as the excitement around cars was growing. The new creation of CCS and the demand for renewable energy completely exceeds the ability to produce the renewable energy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so to give those Long Beach residents the ability to get that renewable energy today is great as we look at supply chain issues and our ability to build out green energy. I think that five years down the road, things might change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But where we are today, to be able to give our residents the option to opt into a green energy plan without the risks associated with the KIA model I think is a great step forward. I think that we as a city can do a better job advertising that rate so that we can encourage residents to move in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that direction. But at the end of the day, with the cost of inflation and gas prices literally at $6 a gallon in some places in Southern California, people are choosing between. Filling their gas tank or feeding their family.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I recognize that this is a very, very difficult time to make the noble choices of green energy. And I think that that's appropriate, that we still give, especially those on fixed incomes, the option to maintain their current rate plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am concerned generally at the cost of utility increases overall that received my notice in the mail about my rate change and my options of what plan to stay on with Edison. And I know that so did my Nana and so did my mom.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And each of them came to me and asked, What does this mean? What are we talking about? And I thought Edison did an excellent job of outlining. If you stay on this plan, your annual cost is a if you go to that plan, your annual cost is B, I think that there's a lot of estimated annual cost'",
        "'speaker_5': ', I should say. There's a lot of opportunity for education. And I appreciate all the work that the staff continue to do to give the community members options. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We have a motion in a second. We also have public comment, I think, with two members of the public. Please come forward. Mr. Shukla. And I believe this is deeply, deeply.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Good evening, Giovanni. Dating. Let's begin strong opposition of this item. I ask. No. I want to plead with you to consider the following factors and not suspend any further CC feasibility efforts as advised by staff. The staff cover letter preceding the MRA report missing informs of the contents of the report.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While sitting city staff failed to conduct community outreach due to the pandemic and health orders. Since this item was answered, city staff were not hindered as various departments conducted outreach regarding a variety of issues. It is foster misinformed further that the MSW report recommends the city not move forward with the city at this time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That statement can't be found anywhere in the report in its entirety. Staff report states maintain competitive ranges of utmost importance to many customers. I ask which customers and to whom does the burden of inaction towards climate action adaptation shift?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I hear sacrifice zones. I hear frontline communities. Are here. Small island developing nations such as ones my family are from threatened by inaction here. In conclusion, I urge you to read the Adobe report and deliberate on a few facts from the report.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some things left out were the ability for us to prepare our own energy and have power over that process as the market changes, as we get left behind. As the market changes. Remaining with us, he would deprive Long Beach of the opportunity, quote, to influence energy procurement or policy to satisfy the needs of its community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now to meet the greatest challenges of our time. Bold action is required. It's not status quo. It's going to be uncomfortable. Relationships we've had for a century might change. They don't have to end. We all have to work together.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When that bill comes due on climate change and it's an action. Is that going to just be paid here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you expect the police? Next week, the police.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Network.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. Both work. But you got it from keeping together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Police giving. Good. So it's really. Uh, rarely in human history. As the fates of so many people in the hands of so few.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can here. Just put up a little louder. Please continue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Jodie Foster I have a great deal of respect for you, but I don't think the city has completed the due diligence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The model that I had proposed that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I wasn't allowed to give. Even information on another working group so called is the most obvious model. You create a JPA with the port and you will do the outreach in Signal Hill Avalon, like with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everything in the Lumby School District. Certain accounts want to leave. I see. He wants to lead. I have done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Research on how the state can reabsorption back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's other ways to do things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But, you know, if you want to optimize around requests, that's that's not hard. Um, but, you know, we we need the data.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need the new.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Data, we need the smart meter data. The state needs a lot of these things that he's not been providing. How much time do I have got? So I'd like to specifically take issue with the idea that it's not necessary to have to meet the cap.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't know that. We don't know what the grand plan for the cap is yet. We have to wait till the review. One thing you should.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Note, council members as a result of this body's decision. In August of last year. Southern California Edison went and picked off every single vulnerable seeker in their service territory in the region. The scare tactics.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'About Western clean energy especially need to be examined very, very closely. Especially with his role in a lot of those activities. This is a receiving file. I think when we have the camp draft, we will see the necessity for this much more.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Prepared to say that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We absolutely need one. But in this city, based on what I know of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Being a Southern.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'California Edison.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ratepayer for 24 years. I don't think you have the time. I think you've made too many bad contracts. And the Asplin was one of them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. There's a motion, the second to receive and file the report from staff members. Please go ahead and cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion is scary.'"

    "Agreement with Los Angeles County to Receive and Expend Measure H Funding for Homeless Initiative Strategies.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Allen. Motion is carried.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Item 41.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Reporter on Health and Human Services recommendation to execute an agreement with Los Angeles County to receive and expend up to 5,236,895 of Measure H funding to implement homeless initiative strategies citywide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Mark I think the Council wanted maybe a short kind of update on this measure measuring rate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can we call it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening on a mayor and council members. So this is an annual measure h funding. And what is reflected here is about 2.7 million of new funding coming through measure H in addition to the rollover of approximately 2.6 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So those two together, this allows for that rollover and to continue to move forward with, uh, with homeless services utilizing the measure h funding. So the measure H funding primarily focuses on homeless prevention, rapid rehousing, outreach, a coordinated entry system as well as case management.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And are interim housing considered under the strategies of Measure H the crisis bridge housing. So as you know, the Measure H is one of the many funding sources that we receive and it is the the primary source from the county in addition to other statewide, such as a half or the federal continuum of care and other services'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And so this is one of the funding sources that allows us to put together our entire program operating out of the MSI and with our partners with that close representation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Please go and have one member of the public. She can be pushing forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They still proud some of the six. With respect to the 32 page equity toolkit that was presented with this agenda item, there's not a single initiative in that 32 pages that is doing anything to end homelessness. You have a language access policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is a homeless encampment on 24 Columbus Boulevard. I take my grandmother there to get her Social Security check. There's not a single person out there. If I brought them to my article. INTERPRETER That will say, at last, I'm ready to no longer be unhoused.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do not know why we are misappropriating county funds to do nothing to end homelessness. The beacon built at Long Beach in Anaheim is 160 affordable housing units at a cost of $530,000 a unit. Operation Homekey, which was utilized by the county to buy the best Western on Atlantic in Anaheim for $21 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': '$21.7 million is at a cost of $20,000 per unit. We are grossly misusing this money and it's not doing anything to end homelessness. You have 32 pages. You have direct install gardens, language access policy, the climate adaption plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are these are the initiatives that are going to end homelessness. They aren't doing anything. This is affecting either the policies or the people that work on them. Great job. But that's not what this funding needs to be used for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I pay property tax. I pay $32,000 in property tax. I pay for my mother's house, my grandmother's house, and my aunt and uncle's house. I don't mind paying taxes. What I do mind is you guys misappropriating what my property taxes are being used for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It should be used not to pay for. They're all gone now. The poverty pimps, but the eggheads with the student loan debts who come in here and they bring poor people in here and they say, hey, to stay a renter forever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're not pushing homeownership. Homeownership is how you get rid of and end homelessness. It's not by perpetual rent ship. Until Blackstone and BlackRock bypass apartment buildings, it's become homeowners. So we need to be using this county money to develop homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't see in the equity toolkit a first time homebuyer program. I don't see anything that is substantial. It's just developing and furthering the bureaucracy. I'm sorry, I didn't I didn't get a liberal arts degree. You know, I work on my hands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I got to go outside and work. And these people, I don't know what they're doing with taxpayers money besides wasting it. We need to see some of this measure h money being used to develop either homeowners or expand in preserving current affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you look at the motels there exist in the city, even in sixth district, you can easily buy up 300 units of affordable housing by buying at the motels a.s.a.p that went through. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'RICHARDSON Thank you. Just so first of all, we're glad that we have our own continuum of care. We continue to get the right funding. And I agree with the last speaker in terms of homeownership, but I do want to highlight that we do have a first time homebuyer program in the works being funded by the recovery plan'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And so my understanding from 2.4, that's one of the first programs to roll out of the recovery. So we look forward to sharing more details very soon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We have a motion in a second. I just want to add, because I think that really spoke to a lot of what I think a lot of us feel some time. And I just want to just reiterate to the team that I do think oftentimes we get stuck in the academics of how to fix stuff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and not just focus on kind of the bread and butter issues of actually getting people in the homes buying motel rooms. So I actually agree with a lot of the public comment that was said. But I do have a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can we get a report when we get back in January on Project On and where we are in the process? I know of multiple times and Ms.. Tatum has done a great job of working on getting us the current three sites we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we have requested to purchase more. We know we have money coming down the state. I feel like all of our focus should be on purchasing motels and getting more folks to folks house. I also think that we should be less worried about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The ongoing. I know. I know. I know. What stops us from purchasing more is oftentimes kind of staff's concern about the ongoing cost after a few years. And I understand that. But I don't want us to lose sight of taking care of the emergency in front of us because we're worried about what can happen four years from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now having to pay for it like that for hopefully mature age kids comes in or the programs from the state. So I just want to put that on the table. I do think, by the way, that staff have done a great job in in the project roomkey project Roomkey space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so this is not a criticism of that because I think we've done a great job with the three projects, what, 250 units, I think total. But we, you know, if we're not purchasing another in the next few months, you know, one or two of the buildings, then I think we're not spending our homelessness dollars the right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'way. And so I think that that's got to be our top priority, is actually purchasing all the motels. And it's also fixes blight issues. The Motel six, let's say, over in Council Councilman Price's district. I mean, there's, like, zero impact to tubes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. Cancer, super nodes, district maps. So six. Thank God. I did great job with that project. But that that that project, for example, and I heard directly from from neighbors and friends that, you know, that live nearby who were really worried and everyone is agreement that there was little to no impact.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other two projects that we've done in the city, the county partnership's incredible investments. So I'm just really grateful for the work you've all done. And I'm hoping also that we stick to the bread and butter and homelessness stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's that's hopefully the the future. Councilwoman, actually, I may have skipped town. We got that. You have. You were the second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor, you said. Oh, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I recently was sent a thread of some communications related to some individuals online, and I read through it. And one of the things that I think is really critical with all of the projects that we're doing is communication.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. Often. A few times we try to throw out my term, my multiple terms on council. We have tried to host homeless forums where community members could come forward and hear from the legal side, the compassion side, the law side, and all the different components and the complexity of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that they're very beneficial. I'm heartbroken that Sarah Green is no longer in the city attorney's office. She was so articulate in communicating to the community how the system works and what processes are in place on both sides to both protect the homeless community and protect the residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the complexities of the prior legal findings and other opinions that have come out. I want to applaud. I believe Councilwoman Allen had a recent homeless forum with similar components to it. But I really believe that that's the city's job as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council offices cannot take on the sole responsibility of that communication. And when I read the threads of what the solutions are that community members are bringing forward and their perception that the council doesn't care because we're not implementing it, I think it goes to our our failure as an elected body and quite frankly, as a city in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'communicating that clearly my council office can continue to do it as long as I'm in office. And the 70 to 150 people that come to it can benefit from it. But we have thousands of community members who want to help solve the problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if they're not informed on the legal standards and requirements that are in place, they're not able to triage with us and support and help us find the solutions in those. So I would just like to say that I'd like to see the city take on that responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know if Councilman Allen has any additional input because I know she's done that. And then finally, I'd like to say that when I talked to the Housing and Housing Services Department, one of the questions that I've asked in the past is how many people that are on housing assistance have gotten off housing assistance?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What programs do we have in place to do that? To create a voucher to be available for someone else who needs it. We are only adding and contributing to helping those that need it. But what are we doing to get the people who are receiving that help up into the next level of economics so that they then'",
        "'speaker_5': 'can be a part of the next level of solution? And so I'd really like to see our transparency on those numbers through our dashboard. I've asked for dashboards in the past, and there was always all these complexities. The pandemic came and dashboards are amazing that we're doing such a great job with them on the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would love to see a dashboard on assistance programs on homelessness. It is a crisis and we need to be transparent. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Ciro. But I thought we spoke already. That is in addition again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bye. Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just, you know, since it came up, I would say I want to make I want to. I like the project calling to the room key. I want to make sure that we go back to prior to that, we looked at hotels, the nuisance motels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Since we've done that, I don't know that we've crossed the two, but if we're in a position to sort of free two birds in one key, I know that there have been challenges in terms of the rules on a state funding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe we look at relaxing those rules, particularly, I know of five nuisance motels from Long Beach Boulevard, North Long Beach that are great potential sites for one of these. And after it serves in that temporary capacity, it could turn into supportive housing or something that's a bit more stable for that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And although that used to be the neighborhood I represent and it's no longer I think it's still a issue of of great importance to the broader north, obviously, I think city wide. So let's use this tool. We've seen that project HOMEKEY works.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we also know that we do have corridors that have nuisance motels and need to be addressed. I thought that needs to be raised. Thank you. I'll second that and happy to carry the mantle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Sarno.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. I really want to reiterate and add to Councilmember Mango's comment about communication, because, you know, I think that when you talk about homelessness funding, you see this big number like it's always in the millions or thousands and it's really hard to grasp where does that money go?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And I think that that is where a lot of my resident ask, because they see the same issues occurring no matter what they've been advised to do, no matter how much activities they try to figure out to do and how much ideas they get.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think that we really need to invest some type type of time, staff, time or energy or expertize that can really communicate the work. Because I know staff is doing amazing work, a lot of work, a lot of ideas, and I just don't know where what is being done even on just it's hard for me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to even grass so that I can communicate this with residents on where the investment is going into and how we're working towards our short term, mid-term and long term solutions. You know, when we talk about housing, that is supposed to be a longer term, but what is it intermediary like?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we know that we provide assistance, but it's really unclear in between and how many staff is needed to do that, all of that. Right. So I think it would be helpful to have some kind of not just dashboard but like some kind of annual report or something that can be, you know, that we can utilize'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so that we don't have to create them individually in our office. And the thing is that often gets to me is I hear from residents, oh, it's happening here in nine, 813, because we are the lower, you know, resource area, lower invested area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think we need to paint a bigger picture that it is not just a city, but a national pandemic. And I think we need to speak to examples that, you know, what are we doing all collectively to locally, right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want more communication materials so that we can point to it as a city and and also within certain parts of how we are really addressing it. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Preston, that I'm going to have to make some comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Soraya and I wasn't planning on queuing up to speak on this, but the public comment, I mean, if I could have. Decently shouted Hallelujah in the middle. I would have. Because, I mean, we just get asked all the time about where the dollars are going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's it's very difficult for us, at least for me. I'll speak for myself to explain because there's just so many nuances in that space that it's hard for residents to understand why we can't just directly fund certain things to solve the problems.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do I do want to recognize, you know, the mayor mentioned the project, Homekey project in my current district and I worked really hard on that project and I want to thank Theresa Chandler and Tracey Colombo or were partners in that with me of course Kelly as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we worked really directly and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Feel like we we manage the whole we proactively message and Tom and Linda were part of that conversation. We knew it was happening and we proactively messaged it in a way that signaled my early support for the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we were able to kind of, you know, address the concerns before it was even really announced. And we worked together really well, I feel like with messaging with our county partners. Then we had a community meeting, it was super positive and the facility actually opened up two weeks before it was supposed to and my staff said'",
        "'speaker_4': ', You want to do an announcement on this? I said, No, let's let it open. And then we can tell people it's been open for two weeks or maybe even a month, and then they'll see that what we were saying about the facility was accurate, that there were no impacts, nobody even knew it had opened.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the key was the kind of operator we had and that was really, really good. So I think the operator I mean, I go by there all the time and drop off cookies and things for the workers there because they do a really good job respecting the space that they're in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you would never know what that that uses there. And so I feel like we should be supporting more and more projects like that. I also think I to Councilwoman Mungo's point, I think we are very inefficient with how we disseminate the information because every council office is independently responding to emails, individual emails every day about the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'legal legal hurdles in the space of homelessness. And one, we probably shouldn't be giving legal summaries because it's it's very it's just so nuanced. And to, you know, even I, I feel like I understand it better than most.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I read the legal opinions and even I have had missteps before where something I said wasn't completely accurate. And I think that's it's really important. So I feel like I wonder if there are some funds available for us to have a communications officer in the area of homelessness, someone who's like, and I hate to say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this, I really do. I can't even believe I'm going to say this out loud. But I am.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next sure to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Come the question 100% of the questions, 99% of the questions are about homelessness. And I have a very good friend who's on the Newport Beach City Council. Same thing. It's not like it's unique to Long Beach. It's the number one concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They get there too. Obviously different scope, but we should have somebody who's accurately paying get paid a lot of money to respond and and to put the actual legal what we can and can't do as a city on these social media sites because it's a put it on the burden.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To put that burden on the council offices is a tremendously inefficient responsibility and a hugely inconsistent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because each of us communicates very.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Differently and the message doesn't come out as clearly as it should. So I don't know exactly how to do that, but I feel like in the social media space, we should be using some resources to educate people. You know, we're I'm I tell everyone all the time, I'm happy to debate with you all day long.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Trust me, I actually enjoy it. But I want to operate from the same fact sheet, right? Like if you're just making stuff up about what the options are for the city and I know those options are illegal, then we're debating.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's an efficient debate, right? We're not debating reality. So I feel like if we had a communicate, if we dedicated some of our homeless money to communication about homelessness and dissemination of that information and engagement, I think it would be a money really well spent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Has the perception of the public is that we have a lot of solutions that for whatever reason we're choosing not to implement. We have a lot of money and we have a lot of solutions. That's just not that's not reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So who communicates that from a collective voice?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I personally agree with everything that's been said so far. I want to add a few things. I think one is I think what you're sensing from the council is the frustration. Also, I think I think the Council on numerous occasions has asked our team to focus on communicating, on bringing in team members, to get information'",
        "'speaker_1': 'out, because we're doing actually really amazing work. And I think what's happened is I know for a fact that if a resident wants to get information about homelessness, their best bet is to call a city council office. It's not the call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The AC or to call the health department and try to find who the right person is. They're getting direct information from members of the Council of Staff. I believe that to be true. I've heard that from numerous members, numerous, numerous residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that also has to shift, because the burden of responding to homelessness has been put on everybody at the status and we spend on the team spend a significant amount of time answering questions that should be answered by the team and Health and Human Services Department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not to say that they're not answering questions because they're answering a lot of questions as well. But there is, I believe, no strategic effort to communicate, one, what we're doing, but to to help people understand how they can actually help us and assist and then what's not actually possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One thing that's always been frustrating is when we came up with the Everyone Home Plan, which I thought is a it's a great, very simple to understand set of of initiatives. We, we stopped communicating it after a while.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't continue to bring it back up and communicate what we're doing. Definitely, we're not actually implementing what's in the plan or doesn't mean that we're not focused on trying to solve those issues, but we certainly aren't communicating it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just want to just kind of reiterate what Councilwoman Pryce said, that I would like to see resources actually spent on serious, proactive community engagement so that people understand what can and can't be done and what actually how they can actually help in a way that's productive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I totally support that. And I also ask these funds, the 5.2, it's going to the CFC. Has this been line item doubt as to where it's going to be spent? Or does the S.O.S. decide how does that work?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm just curious about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is an raised funds. So these funds are line item. There are very specific strategies. So Measure H has I can't remember something like 20 strategies of which we get a set of those strategies and the rest are provided by the county or other providers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So these strategies, the is hunger prevention, rapid rehousing, outreach, coordinated entry and crisis in bridge housing. That is the only thing that we're allowed to use the measure h funding for. And so I did want to, you know, share that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think, you know, we're certainly happy to bring forward more information on sort of the chunks of funding and how they're utilized. You know, when almost all of the work is grant funded, they have very specific outcomes we're allowed to use it for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that is something that I want to share. And we'll I'm happy to bring forward and share more of that measure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'H money not allowed to be used for communication.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is not so. But we have we we have carved out communications funds through one of our other grant sources and we are actually meeting tomorrow to start a communications strategy, meeting around homeless services. So it will be coming back with more information on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were moving forward and then COVID hit and as the health department and all of the things basically take over all other communications, and I do apologize for that. We know it's very important and we are looking forward to bringing forth a strategy back to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I think we're also hearing is we're actually really proud of what you guys are doing. Like everyone loves like the work and knows how hard it is, but I think there's a disconnect. I don't certainly feel that we're communicating that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't think and the public certainly is not receiving the information and the communication needs to be proactive, not passive. And and this is something that we've talked even more broadly about the city, and I know that that's being worked on right now, but I think that we keep coming back to this question, how we're communicating'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with the public, and they have a right to know what we're doing. And that's not an area that I think we are doing very well as a city. So I'm hoping that we can have some more conversations about how this is going to get fixed as our budget moves forward and as we talk specifically about what is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the biggest crisis in the city, certainly post-COVID, and that is when it was before COVID. And that's, you know, our in-house population, how we how we get them housing. Councilman Mongeau.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I've attended some of the major meetings I get around all of my c all the agendas. Not only can you not use it on communication, you also can't use it to move people who are receiving aid out of the need to receive aid, which I think is a weakness of the strategies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the strategies were created with community groups and community organizations. And while I did see some Long Beach staff members attending on our behalf and advocating for certain things, the number of people advocating and the types of things they were advocating for were different three years ago when this passed to where we are today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that that's something else we need to consider and at. Except for I think that right now, at this point in time where we're days away from switching large areas of our city and what councilmember is the main communicator to those individuals?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're at a point where there's going to be a huge shift in gap. Even with the amount of information and meetings that I've been to, both at the county level, the regional level and the local level related to certain areas of my district that have sometimes three and four agencies at play.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the amount of work that my office has singlehandedly done in bringing together and having community meetings where the state senator, the representative of the supervisor of district, a representative from the City of Los Angeles and my self in my office are all in one meeting in a community because there's actual areas that have homeless encampments that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in an area the size of this room, there are four jurisdictions at play for. And that is very frustrating to the residents. And those areas are now the primary contact will become councilmember supervisor. And what I'm concerned about is the six years it took to get to where we are and the communication that it would take.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It has to be a citywide process. We can't be in this position again. And so I go to these meetings and then individuals say, this area has not been cleaned up in three years and my office can state this area was cleaned up on this day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was a rollback on this day it was cleaned up again. On this day it was a rollback on this day. We've offered services 76 times. There are 34 people in the encampment. Of the 34 people in the encampment.'",
        "'speaker_5': '84% of them have received more than ten contacts. We can do that because we have great relationships with homeless services. But that can't be on a council office. It really needs to be on the city staff. And it's also an equitable the number of calls we get across council offices.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just unreasonable for certain offices to receive thousands of calls a year and others to receive hundreds. And we all have the same budget and the same staffing, and that doesn't leave an equitable response rate for constituents. And that's not fair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I will say thank you to my staff who were crazy hours and make sure that everyone gets a response despite the fact that we get 12,000 calls a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just one more thing. One last question also. Did we I know that we've talked about this and it's check chicken, for example, have we funded Mr. Givens and his project that he's been trying to get funded in all the amount of kind of trash and homeless services that provides is that that we were and were able to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do. I know I think many of us have been asking for for him to get support for like a year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe we were able to get him the vehicle that he was looking for. The truth. Can add that I yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we've been working very closely with Mr. Gibbons to get him to apply to the mayor's fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so, as you know, there's a process for application and we've been trying to support him in that process and his board who do the application. So we were able to get him away or the truck so that he can start doing the pickups.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that was a donation from the city, but we're still working on the application process for funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it just seems like there's just a lot of process to get through an application process to just give I mean, the amount of work that he's doing on his own with his volunteers, it should we should be like throwing resources at him and not not going through an elaborate application process that my $0.02.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what I'd like to ask is what's the what's the timing on this money. So if these resources we approved tonight are. They what I want to see in January and I'd like to have this conversation back on the council agenda, if I can ask the the Vice Mayor to amend the motion just to have a discussion'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about resources around homeless services and how we're going to invest in communications. I'd like to see that on the agenda. January, if we're just in, is willing to amend the motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do we have public comment on this item? But it also will prove the money that's on the. That's the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Idea.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's right. That's right. Okay. So we'll have that conversation in January, one of the last week of January. And with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to make a few comments, please, if I may. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So as we carry loud and clear, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Think a lot of you brought up some very good points. In fact, just about a month ago, three weeks ago, we brought together all of our department heads to really talk about what's working, what's not. Where are areas of improvement?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that strategic management retreat really talked about a lot of these same issues, though. We recognize the challenges. We recognize. Communications is probably the top thing that every of our departments talked about. I do want to provide some context.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our health department is grant funded and they've gotten huge amounts of resources through grants and almost none of it paid for. A lot of the things that we wanted to pay for the administrative staff, the the customer service staff, the communication staff, and so over the years, we've actually had to build some of that through some other'",
        "'speaker_3': 'types of methods. For example, they've never had a POW ever for, you know, decades. And about two years ago we found a way to invest in that and with our own money, with SFP and did some really creative things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they can at least have one position that's done that. And that person got rerouted completely to coronavirus this year. So we understand the need for it. I really want to do better with communications. I think we have an amazing story to tell and that is an area that we just are lacking some of the funding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of our funding is incredibly inflexible. When we did the measure H, one of our big requests of the city was don't chop it up into little tiny bits and give us little pieces because we want a direct allocation to us because we know how we can spend it the best.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that was not approved by the county. We spent time in all of those different committees and they wanted their very specific grant funded approaches and then they only gave us little pieces of that. And so you'll see when we had a chance to talk to the management team, where's the money going?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where is it coming from? Where's it going? And you'd be surprised that almost all of it or a vast majority of it is required to go for housing people and only for housing people. And so we'll be able to show you a lot of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it will help you understand some of the challenges, including like when you buy a motel, you have to then operate it and there is no money to operate it. And so that is like for each hotel, it's in that 2 to $3 million range structurally every single year and there's no money coming to operate those'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so we took some risks in the last two years to add those things, even though we didn't have the plans to fund it. And now we're trying to figure that out and then we've got to figure out how to go further.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I do want to I do think it'll be healthy to have a discussion about, you know, what are some of the opportunities we have and then what are some of the challenges. And as Kelly said, Collins is one that we're very much focused on and that those discussions are underway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we'll report back to you in January with hopefully some solutions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That's really great. That's a that's a that was a great update. So thank you very much. There is a there's a motion in a second and will, including a report towards the end of January, please submit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Emotion is scary.'"

    "Emergency Ordinance to Amend School Board Districts.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And our last item on the agenda is item 51. I will ask the clerk to give us a short or whoever, whoever I think has a short presentation on the item or once every ten years. Redistricting happens in this case, it was Long Beach Unified School District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was hoping also that maybe the court can kind of explain what the city's council's role is in this process, because it does happen once every ten years or we adopt both the school districts and the city councils, I'm sorry, and the three year colleges maps.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so if we can, please have that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So once every ten years we go through the redistricting process. This year was unique in that we had the Independent Redistricting Commission who created the Council district boundaries. However, in our charter, the Long Beach Unified School District does fall under us in the election process and we do approve their redistricting boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we did receive the boundary maps from the Long Beach Unified School District, and we will be passing those on to the county on their behalf. So that is this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And does the charter speak to Long Beach City College or is it silent on Miami City College?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The charter does not speak to language City College. They are independent of our charter and our municipal code. So they are sending their maps directly to the county and their board has designated their their areas and is responsible for communicating that to the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, we still do. Take care of the long unified school district in improving their boundaries and communicating that information to the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. I think it's important that we've been asked a couple of questions and a couple of customers asked, like there's three different processes for all three redistricting levels. I know that both the school school district and committee college have been engaged heavily, obviously, in getting the maps forwarded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, in the case of Washington. But of course, I wanted to utilize maps. So thank you for explaining that process. We have a motion in a second. I public comments only do that first and then I'll go to the motion.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Forward. So legitimacy of the school board, approval of the boundaries that the parents and our first school board meeting is questionable, that it was not on their agenda at the time the discussion began. And he appeared on the agenda as discussion continued.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ask the board secretary for an explanation of this rather than explain, she simply denied the fact. Which creates further suspicion of wrongdoing. Brown Act provisions for the agenda. May have been violated. Approve of the boundaries should be postponed until these issues are can be investigated and resolved.'",
