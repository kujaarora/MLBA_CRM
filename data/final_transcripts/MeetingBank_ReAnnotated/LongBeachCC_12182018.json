Read the first time and lead over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading Citywide.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor and member of the Council. The item before you tonight is pursuant to your action back in October of 2017 to comply with SB 415 and move our election dates beginning in 2020. As you know, the election dates are established by the city charter and as described in the council letter before you this evening, the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'amendments to the charter require a vote of the people. However, the California attorney general has opined that 415 prevails over our conflicting charter provisions, rendering the city's current charter provisions relating to the election dates void and allowing you to consider adopting this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This evening, however, there has been a recent development which has called the opinion of the Attorney General into question in a recent case, the Redondo Beach versus the state of California. A trial judge has ruled that SB 415 does not apply to charter cities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This case is now on appeal. The issue is that if the Court of Appeal eventually decides that SB 14 415 does not apply to charter cities, then the Council City Council does not have the authority to change the city election dates by ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this action, if taken tonight, would be void and the elections in 2020 would revert to the dates as provided in the city charter. And any change of future city charter relating to election dates would only be made by a vote of the people at a future election.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are continuing to monitor this case. It is on appeal. The attorney general is confident that they will be successful on appeal. However, we are waiting for a court decision on that. And in that regard, I do have two minor changes to the ordinance to make on the floor this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are on page four and we we put in the wrong date, page four, line four. We need to strike November 2020 and insert 2016 and 2018. And what that section does is it extends the terms for the council members who were elected in 2016 and in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They will be extended by five months to match the dates when we move the election dates to 2020. And that same date would be changed at line 12, we would strike November 2020 and insert 2016 to extend the terms for the school district members who were elected in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that concludes my report. Thank you. Any public comment on this saying no public comment. Councilor Richardson. Councilmember comes from Gonzales. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that it's just prudent to mention I know that a lot of this stemmed from the idea that we had low voter turnout. But if you looked at the voter turnout in June in a primary on the National with a lot of activity going on, District five had almost had over 40% voter turnout.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's without removing many of the individuals. Yet, because L.A. County has not yet been able to reconcile the Department of Public Health's records of death records with L.A. County's voter record. And so that's 40% with the deceased still on the voter rolls.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I appreciate you put it in. I'm sorry I'm putting it into context, as well as talking a little bit about the functionalities of this this wall. And, you know, the irony of this situation that we are talking about building a wall at Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that said, I I'm really curious about the the appropriation from the SJP fund because as a member of the Budget Oversight Committee, I was not aware that we actually had this this this extra reserve or these funds available.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so perhaps Miss Erickson can explain to us how that how we're getting this money.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Austin. I'll put my budget hat back on. Yeah, that's okay. No. Yeah. So we do have if you actually look in the budget book, we do have a description of every fund and the how much funds available is in the fund.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so there was a funds available in the special advertising promotion fund, as I said earlier, because of the restrictions for its use and also the funding source, the transit occupancy tax. We have to make sure we're using it for the proper purposes.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'If their revenue is not there to cover their costs, that would not have been recommended. So it probably didn't come up explicitly in the budget process because there wasn't extra structural revenue per se. But this the surplus was this funds available was shown in the budget book under the this fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So I raised that because it seems like you went through too quite a bit to just secure $25,000 out of the S&P fund for for something that there was a lot of haggling to make that happen. And so had I known there was more money available, I think we would have been a little bit more ambitious'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with funding. You know, one of the the projects that this community lined up, you know, out the door to to support, and that was the the creation of African-American arts and cultural center here in the city. So I'm willing to hear from my colleagues again, this was kind of an unplanned thing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I understand that. You know, it's an element that's going to, you know, make our downtown or city hall look a lot nicer and feel more 21st century. But, you know, the building in itself, I think, accomplishes that without a 60 foot billboard.'",

And so I think that the choice of what was utilized is really great. I think that it's important when we talk about broadcasting the council meetings on the media while we talk about also that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'it would be for visitors, that they would also be able to see and experience our meetings as. When I went to Australia, I had the great opportunity to see councilors from the Australian Government conduct business. And so as long as it continues to align, and I appreciate Mr. Modica reminding us about the discussion, because while we would'",
        "'speaker_8': 'even be able to potentially a lot additional funds, they have to be specific utilizations of those in a meaningful way. The other thing that I would say is, especially since we're so conservative on the Budget Oversight Committee with the public funding, we only try to utilize the funds that are coming in that particular year in the allocation'",
        "'speaker_8': 'process. It is we have not as a budget oversight committee since I've been on BMC, drawn from funds available ever. We've continued to stockpile that for the upcoming Olympics and other things that we've seen to be a major priority and we have not yet had to dip into it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We actually have been so conservative that this year's the first year that we think we probably expended the entire amount available. And I think that part of the questions coming from the community about CEP funds and how they're available for general fund is that first the funds come in, then they're bifurcated in half.'",
        "'speaker_8': '50% of it goes into available for city uses. And then the other 50% is what's restricted. And this is a great use of those kinds of restricted funds. Additionally, through the budget adjustment earlier tonight and through a item that came from Councilman Gonzales, his office earlier in the year when funding of general fund is moved over.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We really appreciate when the Budget Office transforms that money and frees up more general funds. So we think that you guys are doing a great job in that. I mean, I know that's really nerdy accountant talk, but it's what I love to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I just want you to know that I have dug into the numbers and I think that they're doing a great job. And anyone who would like to discuss them at length, I'm happy to grab a cup of coffee and discuss them at any time.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Schubert.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'It hadn't before. So I think we have to make that clear. And also the unique part of this project, as I see it, that that Craig Beck brought up. I can't think of another art project that has a dual purpose of a to an accessory to our council meeting.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I agree. I appreciate the clarification from staff. I have to say I was concerned when I saw the item because we didn't I at least I didn't ask for, nor did I receive a special briefing on this. And when I saw it, I thought, that's a little much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I don't that's just my personal opinion, like media hopeful. It just seems a little not consistent with at least my vision of what we should be doing as public servants and as a city. I just wanted to make sure that it's not flashy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I appreciate hearing from Mr. Beck that we are going to be using this as an extra opportunity for us to show council meetings when we do have overflow. And I have to say, that statement right there completely changed my mind on the whole thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I would have a problem with is if we've got, you know, flashy signs promoting all the great work we're all doing that I would not like. That's just not at all. What I want us to be spending money on is promoting ourselves.'",

Well, we'd like to just add to Councilmember Price's comments in terms of the use of the board in the wall, in terms of imaging and promotion of of of of elected'",
        "'speaker_6': 'leaders and things of that nature. I think that we need to establish some some policies and some some some guidelines in terms of what is what kind of content goes there. Because, I mean, if we don't, you know, it can can can get get out of control.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that said, I will be supporting this item with the with the understanding. I'm looking at a lot of nodding heads that my colleagues agree that that we may have to look at some parameters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. And I and I agree with I think it's been my my interpretation that the wall essentially is like art or you'd have rotating art pieces, creations from the community that it would be kind of a welcoming. Hopefully not advertising.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think nobody wants a bunch of advertising for anything or for events or a bunch of things. But I, I'm assuming that I'm imagining I've seen some of these before. And so I'm thinking that these things are kind of like these permanent art pieces that they can change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They can, you know, they're more it's more of a welcoming thing. And then obviously you can use them, like you said, practically, to ensure that there's information for the public when there is when there's overflow. So I think those are all good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I agree with what everybody said up here. Things are all good. Good comments. And is there a public comment on this? Hi, Mr. Mayor, and congratulations on your upcoming nuptials. And I just want to say I had so many ups and downs in the past few minutes about whether I'm going to get up and speak.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This, I think, jumps off of the, I believe, of $7.3 million that also was needed for, I guess, an anticipated critical technology need infrastructure some months ago. And I just hope that wasn't some sort of over overlooked the fact that you guys needed to have technology needs in that building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But anyway, you talk about the advertising and that brings up the thought, if I'm not mistaken, with the way things are going to work, plenary properties is going to be in some major. They're going to be playing some major role in the management of the City Hall Building as a as a piece of infrastructure, infrastructure in itself'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And so what I'm not hearing I heard concern about whether there would be, for example, advertising or what type of promotion there might be on this wall, but who's going to control that? And it was going to be plenary controlling that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then that's one thing. It's going to be you guys controlling that. Then what is the mechanism for you to control that if plenary is in fact the manager of the building? I think it's a good question. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Hello, Mayor, Vice Mayor Council? Kuzma asked. And there was a great concern that you brought up. $4.3 million. That's a lot of money. We say as far as advertisement is concerned, it kind of seems like it's a contradiction because we have art in the city.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Let's keep stand our ground on that. Like, do we really this a need that we need to spend $4.3 million? That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money to say, hey, we want to highlight the meetings and because another country has done it, oh, this is wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, as a U.S. veteran, I've been overseas in advertising is not one of the things that we're too concerned about. We can see this, like I said, on Mommy's TV. So let's just really table this for a minute.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Go back. And just really consider like I said before, Councilman Austin, I was with you when you said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. You know, and then when you go back and you do an amendment or to change the original submission, that was like, okay, we're going to do this, but let's add this on because'",
