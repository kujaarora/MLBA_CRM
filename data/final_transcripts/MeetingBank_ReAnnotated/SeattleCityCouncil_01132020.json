        "'speaker_2': 'And test it. Thank you. Just moving right into the amendments. I want to start off and we can speak to the merits of the bill after passage of the amendments. I move Amendment one to amend Council Bill 11 9731, Section two, as presented on Amendment one of the agenda and second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This amendment adds the definition of independent expenditure committee to the Definition Definitions section. This necessary definition was previously missing. So any comments? All right. That pass those in favor of voting in support of the amendment vote i. I can oppose not abstaining.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I have a second ticket. Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This amendment changes the title of section seven from limits on expenditures to independent expenditure committees to simply independent expenditures. This what seemed to be a technical amendment is actually a subset of amendment because it would ensure that foreign influence corporations would not be able to simply make political expenditures themselves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The bill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As drafted focuses on limitations to foreign influence corporations, to expenditure to independent expenditure committees. And so this is definitely another loophole that would be useful.'",

We know that out of the 20 largest corporations to PAC in 2019, at least seven of those 20 could have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'met the definition of a foreign influence corporation, federal law and judicial decisions. Interpreting that law make abundantly clear that foreign foreigners are barred from spending money to influence U.S. elections. This is true whether they attempt to influence U.S. elections in their personal capacity or through a corporation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Foreign investors own increasing shares of U.S. corporate stock, going from only 5% in 1982 to approximately 35% in 2017. Foreign interests can easily diverge from U.S. interests. That is true nationally, and it can be certainly true locally in municipal government.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The areas of tax, trade, investment and labor law, there are often divergent interests. Corporate directors and managers view themselves as accountable to their stakeholders, including foreign stakeholders. And a quote from four former CEO of U.S. based ExxonMobil Corp..'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not a U.S. company, and I don't make my decisions based on what's good for the U.S. corporate governance. Governance experts and regulators agree alike that these thresholds, as proposed in this bill, capture the level of ownership. Necessary to influence corporate decisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And even the conservative former chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services and the Business Roundtable concur that 1% is a threshold at which a single shareholder is able to influence significant corporate decisions. One of the most important campaign finance limits that we have is that foreign nationals are absolutely barred from spending directly or indirectly in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'U.S. elections at any political level federal, state or city. Thus, it defies logic to allow groups of foreign nationals or foreign nationals in combination with American citizens to fund political spending through corporations. One cannot have a right collectively that one does not have individually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That concludes my comments on the first of the two bills related to clean campaigns that we're going to hear today. And do I call for the vote? If there are any questions or comments.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'This bill relates specifically to requirements for commercial advertisers and qualified public communications. The current Seattle Municipal Code requires that commercial advertisers that provide political advertising during election maintain the names, addresses, nature and extent of the ad as well as the manner of payment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This bill enhances those requirements and applies them to all qualified public communications and defines a qualified public communication as a paid advertisement that is intended to influence legislation or influence an elected officials position on the legislation. More generally speaking to the need for this legislation, we know that only 5% of the contributions to two PACs made contributions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'over $5,000, though those contributions accounted for almost 85% of the total money PACs collected in 2019. And with that, if there are other thoughts on this bill, I welcome hearing them now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I just want to say special thanks to Council President Gonzales V Nguyen, Brianna Thomas for your work on this. We know that transparency in light win shown on the legislative process and governance is a good thing and brings the accountability to the people of our city and whom we serve.'",

This is the resolution in opposition both to Trump's escalation toward war with Iran and also in response to reports of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Border Patrol agents targeting people of Iranian descent, including U.S. citizens at the border crossing in Blaine, Washington, and also at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Trump's policies towards Iran, including airstrikes and the prominent drone assassination of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, are risking war and it is totally unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq we have seen, have not expanded the freedom, democracy, standard of living or safety of ordinary people in the Middle East have not increased the safety of people in the United States. Instead, they have caused massive loss of human life and ongoing suffering in Afghanistan and Iraq.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for U.S. soldiers, it is ordinary people, especially women, young people and the marginalized who always pay the greatest price for imperialist war. In 2019, working people in Iran, Iraq and Lebanon built inspiring mass movements against poverty, corruption, women's oppression, ethnic oppression and authoritarian rule.'",

Injured of threats of war. We need a mass antiwar movement in the United States and globally in solidarity with the movements in the Middle East.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It was shocking, actually, to find that the resolution that was passed in 23 did not actually oppose the war in any way. And I think we need to set a different kind of precedent, actually, for the Seattle City Council to take a stand against any kind of military aggression.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because I know because we know it will be it will it will not favor the safety and security of our country either. And so we need to make sure that our movement is reflected. The movement that has changed the politics in the city and nationwide and internationally is reflected in the resolution that we passed.'",
