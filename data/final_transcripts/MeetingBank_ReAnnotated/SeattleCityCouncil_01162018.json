        "'speaker_5': 'Required to do as as it relates specifically to cost recovery and protecting the city's liability, that I'm going to support this resolution. But I really hope that we are committed to doing these these these actions that I believe the city is actually supposed to do before we pass a resolution like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so some of those things relate to asking CPD to make an evaluation of what the overtime costs are estimated to be. And if it's if there are overtime costs that are estimated to be more than 3% of its overtime budget, it's considered to be a major a major event.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And those are no secret to the general public in terms of what those issues are and are very well documented in a bunch of sports documentaries that sometimes I spend time watching on the weekend with my husband. But I think that there are real concerns about their business practices, not just their labor practices and human rights practices'",
        "'speaker_5': ', but their business practices as a whole. And I think that the resolution that Councilmember Herbold has referenced in her comments highlight why it's important to have those accountability principles in place and to make sure that they are.'",

And I really appreciate the comments made by our colleagues. And again, we're not going to this blindly, both from a human rights standpoint or from a fiscal standpoint.'",
