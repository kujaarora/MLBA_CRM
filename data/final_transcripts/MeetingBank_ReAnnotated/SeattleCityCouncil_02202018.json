        "'speaker_2': 'And I only point this out because we I don't think the council and elected officials should be nickel and diming these essential services like that. But I think the paramount take home message from what's happening today in terms of this amendment is exactly what one of the speakers in public comment, Emily MacArthur, said, which is that when'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we fight, we win, as Councilmember Herbold mentioned. We are here just eight days after the big town hall that we did on Monday last week, where over 250 people attended. But what was most important was who was at the table.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We didn't have, you know, bureaucrats or department executives at the table. We had service providers themselves and the service users themselves. Queen Bee was at the table, for example, and Nedra Freeman was a table with the table Michelle Martian, who helped John was at the table.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think what we heard was quite eloquently described by council member Herbold. And I thank you for attending the town hall analogy, then, Councilmember O'Brien, for sending a supportive message. That means a lot. I don't want to focus on the amendment itself because of course we are in support of that.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Formerly homeless people who use the share will share animal shelters in the past talked about the community and stability they have found. They're using that, allowing them to transition to permanent housing. So the what's happened is a Human Services Department explained last December that their decision, based on the Pathways Home approach to defund, share and real was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because their funding applications did not show anyone that transition to permanent housing. If that is the case, then it is a problem with the application, not with the reality of the program, because we met individuals on Monday who had transitioned successfully to housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wanted to quote from Michelle Marshawn, who runs real and my office she spoke at. She was at the table and she spoke about this about Pathways Home. And my office transcribed a portion of what she said at the table on Monday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm quoting her now, The Pathways Home report that has become the roadmap for the Seattle Human Services Department blames us for the intractability of homelessness and completely ignores the deep economic divisions and housing injustice of our city today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pathways Home is a cruel euphemism and shocking reversal of decades long partnerships and hard won progress in our community. It forces competition among people and programs to gain scarce housing resources in order to keep city funding. It is not a pathway, and it does nothing to create a home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pathways Home was not demanded or reviewed by homeless people themselves. It's not like homeless people themselves rose up and said, Hey, why don't you all go to hundreds of shelter beds, clothes, hygiene programs and don't limit all of us to force us to compete for too few housing spots.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again and again, the speakers in public comment and at the table pointed out the irony of saying we should transition people to housing and that's why we're going to cut shelter funding at a time when housing has never been more unaffordable than now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Homeless women and men because of these cuts are suffering and at risk today because of the slashing and shuttering of their basic survival service network. It is not by accident that Women in Black will stand for the greatest one month number of outdoor violent homeless deaths.'",
        "'speaker_2': '15 people this Wednesday, one month into the Pathways Home Changes Pathways Home I'm still quoting Michelle Broadway's home was not demanded, reviewed or analyzed by workers who spend many years on the ground doing this work. The department that led this process of defunding defending programs under this euphemism, whose leaders are not even here to listen to us'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tonight, lacks foundational experience, full knowledge of the realities of homeless people and the work being done to keep people together and safe. There are if we had lofty rhetoric about valuing and prioritizing continuing homeless leadership to the highest levels of provider agencies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they did not involve homeless people in the original report. The creation of the RFP and the defunded the only homeless led agencies will ensure that exist in Seattle today. So I think really what for me, two things are important out of what's happening today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One is that when we actually build a fighting movement, we can win sometimes in record time. So let's remember that. And two, we need to look closely into this Pathways Home program, and we should not accepted. I mean, today's victory shows that we should not accept anything as a done deal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The mayor's office may say it's a done deal. The Human Services Department is it's a done deal. Many council members may say it's a done deal, but it's our duty to fight for what's right. So I will be in my committed to Human Services, Equitable Development and Renters Rights Committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will be holding discussions in the coming months to review Pathways Home and its outcomes. And we so we will we will be doing that in a serious way. And I really urge councilmembers to participate in it, and especially thank Councilmember Herbold for continuing to highlight the problems in the based home logic and more than anyone else'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I want to thank all the activists, organizers and the regular people who came out last Monday and were the people who were instrumental in winning today's victory. And bottom line, if Pathways Home and if the mayor wants to talk about housing, we love housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want housing. That is why we are demanding that the city council pass a strong $200 million progressive revenue tax by taxing big business very soon so that we can build over a thousand units of permanently affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, automatically if it's publicly owned, it's automatically rent controlled housing. So if we build over a thousand units every year, then we can actually begin to tackle. That's not going to be enough. But that is far more than we could be doing today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would urge us that we continue building this movement so that we can win a $200 million tax on big business so that we can actually address the affordable housing question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To. Okay. We're about to vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Baxter, did you want to say any words before we vote?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll just be really quick. Thanks to all of you, first of all, for letting me call in and vote and to listen to public comments and to all of your comments. I really want to focus, too, and say thanks to council members Mosqueda Herbold and whereas, because really what you guys did was help us identify the problems'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and find solutions that we could all live with. And that's a real key. Also, I want to acknowledge the mayor for her commitment to getting people inside fast. That's a big change from where we've been over the last couple of years, and having her support is going to be invaluable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm certainly supporting this. Of course, I want to continue with these short term options that we've all been talking about. And as council members watch has said, getting more permanent housing is key. It takes everybody coming together and not fighting each other, but finding the solution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm with you.'",
