        "'speaker_3': 'We've had three committee sessions to mark up this bill, to talk about it, and to thoroughly vetted with the public and stakeholders. You know, I think it's important as homelessness is the defining issue that we're facing as a city and in a lot of ways the defining issue of urban policy nationally, that we be able to go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to the public and say that we are doing everything that we can to stretch the value of taxpayer dollars, to make life easier for the builders that are out there making the permanent supportive housing and to structure policy in a way that is bespoke to the unique needs and unique challenges that people in the permanent supportive housing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'field have faced over the years in an area that we Seattleites have really been a pioneer in cultivating through employment, housing, downtown Mercy Service Center Chief Seattle Club and others. And with this bill, we go one step closer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can go and tell the people of Seattle, you know, we took a hard look at what are the processes, where is the red tape that we can cut, what are the things that could be streamlined? And that experience has told us we can we can move past, you know, by passing new laws and changing regulations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with this legislation, we can carve off almost $50,000 per unit in cost to build permanent supportive housing. We can make sure that those buildings are going up faster and with tighter timelines to make sure that they're coming online to help take pressure off of our shelter system and get more of our neighbors inside.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And today we can take that step. And I look forward to voting this through. I do want to thank Jacob Thorpe and Parker Dawson on my staff for their work and really putting this together with a bunch of stakeholders over the past couple of months.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Out of that cohort of folks, 95% of people stay housed in permanent supportive housing regardless of their mental health or substance abuse disorder or their disability. Research conducted at Seattle University School of Law found that permanent supportive housing is associated with better outcomes related to quality of life emergency services, physical and psychiatric hospitalizations and substance abuse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Better outcomes for residents also save money, making permanent supportive, supportive housing again the most cost effective long term solution to chronic homelessness. Permanent supportive housing is also cheaper for the public than the alternative one year of permanent supportive housing cost, the same as only three days in a hospital or three months in jail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've consistently called for doubling the city's investment in permanent supportive housing. And last year, I among, I think, every member of the City Council joined the launch of the Third Door Coalition and signed on to support their plan to build 6500 units of permanent supportive housing in King County in the next five years.'",

I am happy to be in full support of this legislation today, and I believe that it will shorten that timeline, bring much needed housing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'online, much faster for those who are impacted by the lack of access to affordable housing throughout our community. We must also be looking at near-term solutions to help shelter those who are in need most, whether through tiny homes or apartment acquisitions or the ongoing efforts that we continue to talk about for the immediate non-covid shelter options.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We must do everything that we can to ensure that there is a pipeline out of those shelters and building more permanent supportive housing is the exit plan to open up more beds so that folks who are living outside have a place to go in our shelters.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'd like to also thank Councilmember Lewis as chair of our Committee on Homelessness Strategies and Investments for his leadership in crafting this bill. 119975 to speed the production of permanent supportive housing. I very much appreciate we had ample time to review and consider the legislation and offer our modest amendments to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are fortunate to have the voter approved Seattle housing levy and our Office of Housing, which funds the construction of approximately 2400 units of low income housing each year. But only 10% to 20% of those units are for the permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals suffering from behavioral health challenges and other issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm grateful to my colleagues for adopting three of my amendments at the committee last week, and these amendments will encourage broadband, internet and low income housing, require at least one community meeting for new projects, and ensure that vital human services are made available to residents of the new projects that skip these projects and skip the design review'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Strauss. I'm glad that no unforeseen consequences were realized from putting this through the Select Committee on Homelessness. So I appreciate your indulgence in letting it go from the purview of the Land Use Committee. Just to close this out and I appreciate the the recognition from many colleagues on on what we put together here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and Councilmember Peterson, your amendments that improved the bill and Councilmember Herbert's long standing commitments to this issue throughout her career, and then particularly Councilmember Mesquita, that, you know, we can do all that, the cutting of red tape that we want to, but without resources to back this up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, cheaper, permanent supportive housing is still going to be out of reach unless there are resources to actually build and acquire it. And the investments made through Jumpstart are going to be stretch that much further due to this bill and these regulations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I appreciate your leadership and making sure that there are resources on the other end of the of the hurdle here to realize a lot of these investments. So with that, I don't have any additional comments and look forward to voting to pass this.'",
