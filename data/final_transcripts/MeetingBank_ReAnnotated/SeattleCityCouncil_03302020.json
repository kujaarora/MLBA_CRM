As a council, I think it's important that we understand the full picture of dollars going to support various needs, such as small business support, food assistance, homeless support and housing, so that we are able to make informed decisions'",

The amendment that is included here in Amendment One would require weekly reporting on how these funds are being spent so that we're able to maintain proper oversight and also enabling expedient direction of these funds to where they need to go in the community as fast as possible.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'However, we do need to be clear that in general, when big business gives what they call philanthropy, they often get back far more in profits and through favorable political legislation or absence of legislation, much more than they donate because they are donations by political power.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Guzman, Morales and I have advocated for a big business tax of 500 million per year. I have no doubt that big business will attempt to use their donations into this much smaller, $3 million fund to attempt to argue that they should continue to avoid paying anything in terms of significant taxation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Furthermore, we also need changes statewide and federally, and I think statistics that are being compiled through economic studies in the past decades have shown that actually corporate philanthropy does very little do nothing to address the massive inequality that has just grown nationwide, and now it has become even more emergent in the face of this pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we need changes at every level. My office has launched a petition to Governor Inslee to make a number of those changes, and we will need a movement to fight for this. If members of the public are watching this, then please get involved in this fight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're calling on Governor Inslee to close all corporate tax loopholes to immediately tax big business and wealthy households. And then, of course, federally, we need massive changes. And that's why I'm strongly supporting Senator Bernie Sanders's $2 trillion proposal for a bailout of working families, which also includes $2,000 per month income for working families through this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's also been noted, Sadistically, that on average workers give a higher percentage of their income to charity and the middle class give higher percentage of the income to charity than does big business or the wealthy. And nobody argues, ever, that taxes on workers should be eliminated because they are already giving charity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would urge everybody who's watching this for us to build a movement that is vigilant about not accepting that argument from big business. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. So on. And I agree with your remarks. You know, it seems like every time we talk about progressive taxation or taxation in general, we oftentimes get the philanthropic efforts of big business thrown back at us as an argument to prevent or minimize taxation or revenue creation tools.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate your reminder on that front. Are there any other comments or questions about the underlying bill before we vote on it? You have not seen any one come forward. So we'll go ahead and vote on the bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So will the clerk call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended?'",

However, I have received a lot of emails from constituents who are are expressing their major concern and fear and pain that they're suffering during this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's I wish we had more time just to think this through. I appreciate the comments of Councilmember Strauss that this is a resolution and we're simply asking the folks at different levels of government to consider these and they can deal with those specifics.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the sentiment that we're expressing here is that people are struggling and that we need our of their elected officials to address that. I do want to commend our congressional delegation, though. I don't want this resolution to be viewed as that.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I will also say that, you know, our our leaders gave a trillion and a half dollar windfall to the financial sector to make sure that they were able to weather this storm. And so I think it is is critically important that we do what we can to help our constituents who don't benefit from that kind of windfall'",

No suspension means you don't you don't have to pay it at all because of the crisis that the scale of the crisis that we're in.

        "'speaker_4': 'But big banks are absolutely ruthless. The decisions that they make are driven by market forces, not personal kindness. In fact, big banks, corporate landlords are some of the most precious corporations who have plundered the economy. In the Great Recession, there were millions of foreclosures of middle class and working class homeowners while the big banks got bailed out'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So I just wanted to say, in the interest of our movement, that watching basing any idea on the expectation that big banks, mortgage holders and corporate landlords will do the right thing is just a recipe for massive impoverishment of millions of working families.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've already seen the Federal Reserve's projection or second quarter unemployment. They're predicting a 30% unemployment rate. That is depression level unemployment just now. Just two days ago, we heard from the Department of Labor that statewide unemployment is at least around 130,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that is not underestimate. We know that. And so we we are talking about just endless numbers of families and working people, individuals who are just going to be wiped out if we are not going to do something about this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And obviously, the city wide issue won't be enough yet. We do need to fight for it as well. And as far as there are any concerns raised by which again, it's stunning to me that these so-called concerns are being raising that or maybe people are getting working, people are getting some relief from other sources or what if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they are? Absolutely, they should be. And we should be thanking people like Senator Bernie Sanders for absolutely fighting for working people in the US Congress. But whatever support people are getting right now is not going to be enough.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in the meanwhile, the banks are getting $1,000,000,000,000 a day bailout. So let's be clear about that. All the money is going it's not going to working people. And we are not in any danger of over funding working people's needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to close by saying that this is a nationwide movement. Right. There may even be similar demand for an amazing 150,000 signatures. And I support this resolution, of course. But most importantly, I'm committed to building this movement because we all need to be clear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a resolution. It makes a statement, but does not by itself enact a suspension of rent and mortgage payments. And it is an important step forward. But I want members of the public to understand that we need to keep fighting.'",

You know, the basis and argument for this bailouts is these are companies that have been adversely affected.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's no way they could have planned for a pandemic and what a pandemic would have done to them. The exact same argument can be made in support of the renters and people who have recently entered into mortgages to be homeowners who never could have anticipated or planned that when they signed their mortgage or when they signed their'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, in my understanding and Councilmember Morales could correct me on this, there's nothing in this resolution to suggest that should Governor Inslee or should Congress heed our request that there be some support to back up those policies and those actions?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's very foreseeable that when inevitably there's another relief bill that comes from Congress, and we know that ultimately, you know, be it this summer or later, the spring, there's probably going to be another big relief bill that a big part of it, based on the exultation in this resolution and the other resolutions from other cities'",

So there's nothing to even though it's not necessarily specifically enumerated on what are the exact policy prescriptions be that Congress and the governor take and pursue?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'of consideration that we generate lend to to banks and to airlines at the national level, but that we aren't lending to working families. So I think it's fully appropriate given the posture of this. I don't think that let me put it this way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I find it highly unlikely that Congress would or that the state government, for that matter, would put something like this forward without putting some resources behind it to make sure people are whole. So I don't have a concern in voting for it on that basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The only other thing that I want to do, and similar to the exhortations that were made earlier by some of my or the the urgings that were made by some of my colleagues earlier, I just want to briefly address the general public for the folks that are listening in today, based on a lot of the communications my'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just want to follow up with what Councilmember Peterson said and also share that we all agree and understand the crisis we're in. And I really don't want to go into the US and them saying I just for once, can we all be in the end zone at the same time?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The clarification that I have is when I'm looking at the resolution, which is four pages long. It talks about the immediate moratorium on residential and commercial mortgage payments and rent. It is. And I'm glad Councilman Peterson pointed this out, because when I was looking at this resolution and looking at the letter that Councilmember Mosquito put together, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, I was inclined to vote yes because, first of all, there really wasn't a date in there. But when you actually read it more thoroughly and I, I pulled it out and then finally printed it.

        "'speaker_2': 'It means that the Seattle City Council is speaking in one voice and that we are resolute to do the following. So we are voting if we vote yes on this, that and I'm guessing as obviously extends to residential and commercial mortgage payment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But not only do we have a moratorium, but we also have a forgiveness of all the debt. Is that correct? What I'm hearing in the sentence so that means that we have a moratorium during this crisis. And whenever this crisis ends, whatever was accumulated, residential and commercial mortgage, folk, people who are on these documents, payments notes that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they'll be forgiven of all debt. And that's what that's what the that's the core of what's happening here. And I just want to make that clear. So this isn't about that. We are all and everyone is is not in agreement that we don't want to see a renter, a homeowner, not be burdened with this kind of debt'",

So just so we have clarification from council to councilmember up, is that what you're actually this is actually what will be voted on, including with Councilmember Strauss's amendments about the other items that would be a moratorium on'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Morales, would you like to answer that question?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. So I'm sure we've all heard, as I said, you know, heard from tenants, heard from business owners. I've talked to several property owners who say, you know, I understand that my small business tenant can't pay rent there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They would shut they don't they're not bringing in any money. So it makes sense to me that they shouldn't be paying rent. But I still have a mortgage to pay. And so what am I supposed to do? So that's what this is addressing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, we have it. Not just tenants and residents, but we also have commercial property owners and commercial renters who are in the same boat. And so this is a way to to address the property owners issue, the tenants issue, and understanding that, you know, deferring payment for three or four months isn't really going to solve the problem'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for some of these folks. So so the short answer is, yes, that is what we're calling for. As I said before, this is part of a national organizing movement because this isn't just happening in Seattle. Across the country, renters and property owners are trying to figure out how they're going to pay their bills.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so this is this is an unprecedented national event, a global event. And things are going to be very jarring for quite some time. So yes, the short answer is yes. That is what this resolution is calling for.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, it is. Councilman Juarez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President So you're saying that a commercial, somebody that owns 20 plus units or apartment. Who also has a mortgage to pay if they don't collect renters, which we're going to exempt. So that person, let's say, owns 30 units of rental is going to also, from our resolution, understand that we are lobbying for them as'",

So typically we deal with letters that are being circulated in in an open public session in order to make sure that we're complying with the Open Public Meetings Act.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Or Councilmember Mosqueda an email and we'll we'll be sure to get you on as well. It's a really great opportunity not just for us to talk to one another, but for us to be guided by the on the ground work that our advocates in the housing community are doing, as in particular led by the Washington Low Income'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing Alliance. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold. Are there any other questions or comments by my colleagues? Okay. Seen none. Just to avoid having to do a roll call again, I'm going to sort of do this in the in the negative, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you do not want your name added to you, do not want your electronic signature affixed to the letter as described by Councilmember Mosqueda. Please, please indicate so now. Okay. I'm not hearing anyone register their objection. So it sounds like you have the consent by all council members to have their electronic signature affixed to your letter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Member State I thank you for bringing it forward in open session and all present with our rules and state law. Really appreciate it and really looking forward to having that letter be transmitted to the governor. I think it's really important as we are continuing our conversations around providing relief to tenants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's really important for us to acknowledge that there are many renters who who need this relief. But there's also it's really important for us to acknowledge that there are plenty of homeowners or condo owners that are going to be and are experiencing economic distress as a result of the economic crisis that was precipitated by COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's really important for us to make sure that we're looking at this as holistically as possible, to provide that to ensure that those reliefs can be provided. So I really appreciate your advocacy. Okay. Is there any other further business to come before the council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Hearing on that was the last item of business on our agenda. Our next regularly scheduled full council meeting will be on April 6th at 2 p.m. and there is no other business to come before us, so we are adjourned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, everyone. Thank you.'"
