        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Colleagues, this is Council Bill 120034. It authorizes the city to execute a collective bargaining agreement with Protect 17 Legislative Analyst's Unit, otherwise known as the Central Staff Analyst Bargaining Unit. This is a new collective bargaining agreement and the first ever for the Legislative Department of the city of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Legislative Analyst's Unit is comprised of approximately 15 regularly appointed city employees who certify Protect 17 as their bargaining agent in July of 2020. This collective bargaining agreement is a three year agreement on wages, benefits, hours and other working conditions from January 1st, 2018 through December 31st, 2021.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'As an individual worker, you have little to no power to push for your rights. But when you get organized into a union, you have the power to shut your workplace down. And that is real power to bring your boss to the negotiating table as you fight for better pay and working conditions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Getting a first contract is historically one of the most difficult and important steps in successfully unionizing the workplace. So as a union member myself, I want to congratulate central staff and protect 17 on this step forward. Ultimately, a union is its members and unions are only as strong as their members are union activists in the labor movement'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We have seen that the moment you sign a contract, you start to see things that that may go wrong with, that you need to start preparing for the next contract negotiations. Ultimately, it will be up to the union members to decide what to fight for in a contract.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And I also understand that workload and work hours is that is something that needs to be taken up for them in the next round of contract negotiations, because I know that that is an important part of what central staff are trying to achieve, and it is certainly something that the union has the power to bargain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I wanted to stand in solidarity with all the union members in the central staff. Just a recommendation finally I have for unions bargaining. This and other union contracts is to do everything in their power to remove no strike clauses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most union contracts in the US do they have no strike clauses that prohibit strikes during the contract? That was not always the case and it's unfortunate because it abandons one of the most important forms of worker power in advance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obviously that is not something that is concretely posed right now. But in general, as a general point, I think it's important in the labor movement to remove no strike losses or not accept no strike losses. And retaining the option of a strike is always important for the power of a union to resolve grievances and to fight for'",

        "'speaker_3': 'The Surveillance Impact Report also says that this technology is used to find people with outstanding warrants. Think about wanting a ride to a stop first for expired plates and then for an outstanding warrant. Before he was killed, this is technology used to allow the police to do more traffic stops like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No doubt proponents of this technology will point to uses like Amber Alert. But the reality is you do not need a computer for serious issues like what would generate Amber Alert. Human beings will look down and will look for a car in an Amber Alert.'",
