        "'speaker_1': 'And so, you know, for me, even in the face of all of the reports and studies that support a $75 million sales specific contribution, it's regrettable that we were unable to find a path among our colleagues and with the mayor that they'd be willing to support a higher taxation rate than 275.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So. So it seems to me that what this debate is about is the anger or fear of what this city is becoming. On the one hand, people are looking at the affordability of this city and looking at our homelessness and the death on the streets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And one would conclude that's what we're becoming and that's what this fight is all about. And then on the other hand, people are saying, well, now you're trying to drive out businesses and drive out good jobs and making policy or investment decisions that can kill our economy because we are a thriving city.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'use these oratorical skills where our economy is heading into. When I look at this new investment stream, this new revenue tax stream, I think we have to convince the public that we're using it wisely and strategically. And I think we've failed in that regard as a city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when I look at this, whether the number was 75 or as I proposed to 75 or even 500 or $1,000 for that matter, I think what's most important is the public has an assurance that we are investing wisely in the future and our present investment strategy, and I don't think we've accomplished that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll have some more comments on the spending plan. But I think, again, this proposal that we brought forward balances that balance, that balance between investing now for emergency services, but looking at our future. So for me, that's what this debate is about.'",

I really appreciate Councilmember Herbold acknowledging the role of the movement, but let's face it, the movement is the single most important factor, without which we would not even be having this discussion.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'We and it wasn't just these last few weeks, if you remember, one of the more recent starts to this movement was when we occupied City Hall overnight in November. And at that time, the council majority voted against an even smaller tax.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So here we are. And the message that we are sending is that working people, not just in Seattle, but in every other city, can have the courage to take on one of the most powerful corporations in the world and the richest man in the world.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you could build a movement that can win. However, let's have some sober thoughts right now. The need for at least 150 million in progressive business taxes was confirmed just last week by the study that many have mentioned, ironically, commissioned by the Chamber of Commerce, in which they determined that King County requires an immediate investment of over'",
        "'speaker_6': '400 million to build million dollars every year, to build 14,000 affordable units. And those for those who are concerned about data that is based on hard data, there is an unbelievable statistical correlation between rising rent and rising homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So building permanently affordable housing is the proven solution to address the scale of the housing crisis. The guitar that I didn't. I suppose that. The old man of the movement, hundred and 50 million was cut in half by the first draft of the ordinance to 75 million that got voted out of committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This amendment would carve out another third out of that 75 million. And we have to ask why? Whose interests are councilmembers Sally Bagshaw, Debra Juarez, Rob Johnson and Bruce Harrell defending when they fight to reduce the amount big business will be taxed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, that can be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can they honestly argue that regular working people in Seattle do not desperately need the affordable housing a business tax would fund?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Say? Mustafa, I'm going to warn you that that's disruptive and that's my warning, so I'm going to have you removed if that happens again. I understand. And from when I hear another one, they're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Going to say, you're going to get the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Same notice because I have to give you honors. I thank you very much for that one. Notice customers want, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you right now. But I also support anybody's right to speak. It's her right to disagree. I don't agree with that issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whether you support or not, the issue is we're going to comply with some decorum. Please proceed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Could the council members honestly argue that regular working people in Seattle do not desperately need affordable housing a business tax would fund? Or perhaps they would argue that the largest 3% of businesses already paid too much in taxes or that they could not afford it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's review the numbers. Last winter, Trump gave a massive tax cut to business, big business, cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Amazingly, this corporate tax handout was written in a way to allow it to apply retroactively to any taxes companies like Amazon avoided paying in the past.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Amazon, through the Trump Trump corporate tax cut, received a $789 million tax windfall on their all unpaid taxes. Imagine if you failed to pay a parking ticket and after a couple of years the government decided to say, Oh, don't worry about paying that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That never happens for working people. But it does happen for the richest companies in the world. For some reason, council members that claim to oppose Trump's policies of corporate tax cuts are eager to push those same policies. Here in Seattle, the reality is there is no way that this tax will be a burden on big businesses in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Seattle. Jeff Bezos has made so much money this year from the ballooning value of his Amazon stock portfolio that on average he has become $275 million richer every day. That means that every day he personally makes enough money to pay for all of Amazon's share of this tax for the next 13 years every day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If this amendment passes, he will he will have made enough money to personally pay Amazon's share of this tax every 58 minutes, 24 hours a day, including when he's sleeping. How can he personally make enough money to pay a year's worth of this tax?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In less than an hour of sleep. And yet, elected officials are still worried that he's being taxed too much. Where was the concern for homeowners paying levies, but was a concern for workers paying sales taxes? Regular people are actually struggling to pay taxes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Amazon and other big businesses are not. This backsliding amendment is being put forward not only because council members harrell Suarez back Sean Johnson voted against taxing big business, but also because Mayor Durkan threatened to veto doxing. Amazon which donated $350,000 to our election campaign.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Make no mistake, money is power under capitalism. I thank the council members who voted for the $75 million progressive tax in committee, and I urge them to stand strong today against Amazon's extortion and to stand with the housing justice movement, send a bill to the mayor and let her decide whether she will veto funding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For the housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's let the city see whose side Durkan is on with Dawkins deal with Jeff Bezos. She has made it crystal clear where she stands. Rather than being the mayor of Seattle's working people and struggling small businesses, she has declared herself the mayor of Amazon's billionaires.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to point out one other very, very crucial problem with this backsliding amendment. It places a five year sunset clause on this progressive business tax. In other words, five years from now, it would take a new ordinance to have it continue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would mean that in five years time, in less than five years time, we would have to build another powerful movement just to win the same thing that we won that we would win today. It would be totally naive of us to think that Amazon and other big businesses will not use a similar brutal and extortionate tactic'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in four and a half years to attempt to stop attacks, to attempt to stop the attacks from being renewed. If we put a five year sunset in this legislation, I can guarantee that 4.5 years from now, Amazon will threaten to lay people off again, claiming it is because of the attacks again and use that as leverage to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'attempt to prevent its renewal. Power under capitalism is anything but equal. Amazon has disproportionately more power to avoid taxes than working class homeowners, and they have proved that they are willing to use that power to bully the city and its working people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is unconscionable to ask the courageous tax Amazon movement to have to wage this political struggle again in five years. Instead, our movement should be free to build a continue to build for rent control or. To unionize new sections of Seattle's workforce, including Amazon's warehouse and tech workers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to see the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council increasing the tax on business. 250 million. I know that's not going to happen. I think if not that, the council should should at least hold firm on a $75 million progressive business tax when the final legislation comes to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will be voting yes because that will be our movement's victory, and I will have some remarks then. But at this moment, I will vote against this backsliding amendment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Have you seen? We? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have we have this we have this backsliding amendment moved in second it. So any further comments from any councilman or worse. You yet the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. Hold on now. My name is Deborah Suarez. And I'm an a member of the Blackfeet Nation. I'm also a Latina. I was born and raised in this country because it's my country. I will not impugn the integrity or the motives of any of my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because you are my colleagues. You are not my rival. You're not my competitor. You're my colleague. And I represent all of the residents and the people of the city of Seattle. Eight councilmembers worked hard to get to. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sometimes you have to lead. Sometimes you have to compromise and not bully. Sometimes you have to look beyond your own echo chamber in your own movement. Sometimes you have to look beyond your own personal world view. Political lines and slogan mill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sometimes you have to do that as a woman of color. I did not get here by being part in the pocket of corporations, big business slumlords, the corporate Democrat or the prison industrial complex. All things that I've been accused of because God forbid I use my mind, my education and my upbringing, my wisdom to bring what I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'believe, what I believe is leadership. Here as an indigenous woman, as a Latina. Because I, like many of my sisters up here, worked hard. And I know you don't just get what you want because you want it. Sometimes you get what you want because you work hard for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it comes in increments. My people did not get the right to vote till 1924. I know what it is like to fight hard and to be an activist in it, advocate it, to move the ball forward. And that's how you get there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's called leadership. I understand discrimination, racism, disenfranchisement. I know what it's like to be homeless, to live in a HUD home, to have food stamps, to be poor. I get all that. I been there. So I will not sit here and have somebody impugn who I am and how I got here that I don't care about people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who are unsheltered. I am proud that I worked with my colleagues this weekend. I am proud that I sat down with Labor. I sat down with social services. I talked to business. I talked to everyone across the spectrum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I want to particularly thank Councilman Mascara. Councilmember Herald. I'm Councilmember Herbert Councilmember Gonzalez. Because we worked hard. If you can't see that, then I'm sorry, but I'm going to vote yes today because I plan on being here and I plan on moving this forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I plan on sheltering the unsheltered. And I don't just give up and I don't need a T-shirt to feel that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, so we are going to vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amendment number 24 has been properly moved and seconded. I'm going to ask you to vote and raise your hand. So all those in favor of Amendment 24, please say I and raise your hand I those opposed. Say no one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Raise your hand. No, the ayes have it. 8 to 1. We have another amendment to the ordinance. And I'm going to sort of think out loud here. I don't believe Amendment 22 A is being brought forward, but I think 22 B, which exempts health care providers from 40 is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember Bagshaw, I believe you'd like to make that motion and describe it, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we talked about this last week and we ended up tabling it. The impact on this would be to exempt businesses that are engaged primarily in the provision of comprehensive health care services. In particular, the polyclinic brought this to our attention.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Polyclinic offers Medicare discounts, Medicaid discounts and no coverage services to almost 46,000 people a year. And they offer $148 million worth of services to low income and Indigenous. Councilmember Gonzales, you asked specifically for that, that data and also what would the impact be on them if they remained within the structure of this particular legislation?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their revenues would be about 350 to $400000 estimate. And the tax impact they since they will not reduce employee wages or they wouldn't and they couldn't, that would impact the care that they have offered by about $1,000,000. And why should Polyclinic be exempted from the jobs tax is because under the current legislation we have exempted all of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seattle's large health care systems and exempted them because they're nonprofit. And this amendment would ensure that like organizations are treated similarly. And I recommend that we pass this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So you move to amendment number 20 to be as their second. Second. Okay. So we moved in second, so. Okay. Any further comments on amendment number 22 be to the amended legislation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a quick question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I missed I missed I missed the part about and maybe I just misheard you, but can you repeat what central staff's evaluation is in terms of the revenue impact as a result of this amendment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council central staff didn't give this to me. Polyclinic did. They said that their tax on them for their DHT revenues would be between 350,000, 400,000 that they would pay. And that would in order to cover that, because they wouldn't reduce wages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Couldn't reduce wages, it would reduce they would reduce the care that would be offered by about $1,000,000, $1,000,000 worth of care.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any more discussion on amendment number 20 to be?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just need to do the math really quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm going to call for a vote if everyone is ready. Councilmember What?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of those issues that was not really clear. Just to clarify that nonprofit hospitals are already exempt based on their nonprofit status. So this amendment would only help hospitals that prioritize profits for their shareholders. And just like other for profit businesses, the intention of this tax is for it to come out of the business's profits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we should be clear, in the absence of single payer universal health care in this country. There are people and corporations that profiteer off our deeply exploitative pay or die health care system. Let's not forget how Martin Shkreli brought the board the pardon to EpiPens and then drastically increase the price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Obviously, most of our profit hospitals are not anything egregious like that, but they are. But if they are for profit, then they don't need a loophole built in for them. So I will be voting no on this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Swan, Councilmember, your response?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just. What? I'm just responding to the question about shareholders. My understanding about the polyclinic is that the physicians at the Polyclinic own the polyclinic, and for that reason they're classified as a profit entity and they do pay federal income tax on the profits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm not trying to conflate one with the other. I'm trying to preserve the kind of health care services that are available. And this entity provides 25% of their of care to those as part of a charity care hospital requirement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to make sure they continue to do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the Medicare and Medicaid numbers of patients that they receive, I believe. Okay. Okay. Caspar Herbold, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to, for the record, address a question that I had last Friday. I had asked how the 25% Medicare Medicaid standard compared to the Washington State Hospital charity care requirement. And I learned that there is no minimum amount of charity care required by hospitals by state law, although hospitals are required to prepare a charity care'",
        "'speaker_1': 'plan. And I also learned that under that charity care plan, sort of the mean contribution, because all hospitals are required to report on their charity care, the mean charity care is about 1%, but that Medicaid and Medicare are not included.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As part of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That charity care planning that they have to do. And so these costs associated with Medicare and Medicaid have a much larger negative impact on finances than charity care themselves. So meaning the standards that folks have to fulfill in their charity care plans are less rigorous than the standards that we are setting out in this charity care requirement'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of of 25%, specifically for Medicaid and Medicare. That would have that's a more rigorous requirement and has a greater impact on on on these for profit medical institutions. And for that reason, I'll be supporting them in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you Casserole for that additional research. I appreciate that. Okay, let's vote all those in favor of Amendment 20 to be which will exempt some health care providers from the please vote I in raise your hand i.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you oppose it, please say no one. Raise your hand. No. Okay. So that amendment passes as well. So so now work with me on this clerk. I believe those are the only amendments on the ordinance. And if we could vote on the full package now, then we'll move to the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that correct? Okay. So we are going to vote on the amended legislation and now would be the time for you to say any closing remarks on the ordinance, not the spending plan. We don't want hear about the spending plan right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We just talking about the ordinance. So does anyone want to have any closing remarks otherwise? I think we're ready to vote. Wait. Make sure. Councilmember Herbal, Eurasian Union. Okay, you got it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm going to restrain my closing remarks for the typical thanks that we like to give our colleagues and the public and staff who have been working on issues of great import like this and really doing more than is fair to expect of of our staff and of our community partners in particular.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank Councilmember Gonzales. It's been a real pleasure to have worked with you for the last six months on this issue, first as co-chairs on the Progressive Revenue Task Force, and then every step of the way as we've crafted the legislation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I also thank, Councilman Mosqueda for your deep commitment to affordable housing and workforce stability and your ongoing support and collaboration throughout the process. I'd like to thank Councilmember O'Brien for your long term commitment to developing more progressive revenue and to ensuring that our region's most vulnerable people have access to the same opportunities as everyone else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then finally, I want to give a shout out to my staff, particularly Sharon Perez Darby, who staff this issue for my office, as well as the council central staff who have been working tirelessly on with us, really working to come up with a new version every time that we have a new proposal that we were working'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to try to take to get some consensus around. So shout out to Danny Otter, Eric Lee and Tracy Radcliffe. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I wanted to just echo those those thanks as well. You know, over the weekend, a lot of our staff canceled or reprioritized a lot of their Mother's Day weekend plans. So I want to thank them for for all of the hard work and effort that they contributed to getting us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So huge thanks to Tracy and Alan and Dan Cody, writer from my office, who has been dogged in his staffing on this issue. And I really appreciate it. I know it's been a lot of countless hours, so thank you, Cody, for all of the time and effort that you have spent on making sure that I get my'",

But I but I am really grateful for all of our all of our combined staff, including the staff from Councilmember O'Brien's office and from Councilman Mosquito's office, who have really contributed a lot of time to to to working late into the evenings to get us to where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we're at and to make sure that we're prepared. And I would be remiss if I didn't think a lot of the advocates who have been really getting me up to speed over the last six months on these issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So Alison Eisinger, Lisa Dugard, Lindsay grad from SEIU, 1199 Northwest, and many others who have really given me a tutorial in this space in terms of what it's really going to take to see transformational change. And so I just want to thank you all for your ongoing dedication and fervor and commitment to making sure that we move'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the needle here. And I look forward to working with all of you as we move forward to make sure that that our priorities continue to be transformational.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Mosquito.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. You know, I think that we've all made some tremendous strides today. And I want to reiterate, we're going to need everybody to continue the work so that we can continue to get progressive revenue in the door.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're making a significant down payment today, but we want to make sure that folks are not only offered a place to stay so that they have a warm bed, but they actually get a home. Because as we create housing and health services, we know folks are going to continue to come here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're going to come here for a good living wage job. They're going to come here to start their own business. They're going to come here as economic refugees and as climate refugees and as immigrants and refugees. And to be a welcoming city, we must build the housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In order to do that, we couldn't do without your support. I just want to thank some of the folks who've been part of the task force and the efforts to push this forward. UFC W Local 21 and 1199.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for participating in the task force to SEIU 775 9 to 5 Unite here locally and working Washington along with the Seattle King County Coalition on Homelessness. Thank you for sending the statement that I read today about your support for this effort and the spending plan that will be in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you to the public defenders of the building construction trades, the Martin Luther King County Labor Council. For all of your ongoing work and negotiation to make sure that we could find a path forward. I so appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm happy to see that our workforce standards pieces are reflected in their thank you for all that work. I want to also thank our incredible central staff. Thank you so much to Dan Edgar, Allan Lee, Tracy Ratcliff, Eric Sons, Communications Team, Joseph People, Dana Robinson, still Stephanie Guzman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also to all the allies that have already been mentioned, folks were working the entire weekend up until midnight last night. And to my staff especially, thank you to Seattle and Michael for your incredible work. I want to reiterate what Councilmember Suarez said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We got here because we put pen to paper. We got here because we took bold policy ideas and we put them into action. We got here because we listened to each other and we didn't accept. No, we kept pushing the ball forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And even after today, we will continue to push for more progressive revenue. Thank you for all your work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Skeeter. Well, can we get a little tell us a step closer to voting? I want to actually put it in play. I will move to pass counts bill 119250 as amended. Is there a second? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any more closing remarks? Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I want to also thank everyone who's been working on this, but specifically highlight the folks that came out last fall during the budget session and really did some work to get us almost across the finish line during budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are two things that I see at the high level that this piece of legislation does. The first is it creates significant investments to address the housing and homelessness crisis, who are facing and the community that came together last fall and has done all the work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From then until now has done an amazing job at creating broad awareness in our community of how great the need is and what are the types of investments we need to do. And I'm really grateful for that work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The second thing that I believe this legislation does is it starts to address the regressive of our tax system. You've heard numerous folks up here say that Washington state is the most regressive tax system in Seattle. Within Washington state has the most regressive tax system in the state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the things that I've seen in this process is that, well, I think most of us view the regressive tax system as a flaw of our system. It clearly benefits some. And when we start talking about changing that system, that benefits some.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To make it more fair, there's a lot of resistance, and so we have a lot of work to do if we want to reverse that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Katherine O'Brien. Elsewhere. Mosquito bite at that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I just wanna say thank you, Katie Wilson. Thank you for helping to lead the coalition. Really appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was also realizing I forgot to give a shout out to Katie Wilson. So we're like a hive mind. But Katie, thank you so much for all the work you've been doing on this issue and for being available to all of us to talk to us through these really important issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you, Katie. Raise your hand. I want everybody to know who you are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Are we ready to vote? Council members who want. But to put the clock on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm just kidding. Secretary Clark.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would like to address my closing comments on this ordinance vote. To those of us in the movement who have volunteered thousands of hours of our time, donated our own funds, and put ourselves on the line for months and in some of our cases years to build a movement, to tax big business and build affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sure I'm going to leave a lot of names out, but to name some who are on the front lines the Transit Riders Union, Housing for All Coalition, the Affordable Housing Alliance, the Labor Movement. We All Share Women in Black Nichols Ville, Socialist Alternative and the Democratic Socialists of America.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also want to dedicate my remarks to those of you who weren't part of the movement actively, but agree with us and are struggling yourselves to maintain a foothold in this city that is very quickly becoming a playground for the wealthy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What we win today for affordable housing would not have seen the light of day without the movement we have built. Big businesses like Amazon have many tactics to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, and it has required true dedication and sacrifice from hundreds of us to bring us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I cannot possibly overstate the respect and gratitude that I have for everyone in this movement. If we had had a stronger movement, that could have changed the balance of power between us and the Goliath even more. We could have won more.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if we had had a weaker movement than we had today, then we would have won less or possibly nothing. We all know that. What we win today. We'll make affordable housing available for hundreds of people and families who would otherwise have none or be forced out of the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we should not understand that incredible victory that we can win today. However, we are also very conscious of the total inadequacy of the current legislation to match the scale of the crisis. Compare the $410 million that is needed in the Seattle region to what is being passed today to deal with the affordable housing crisis.'",

Number one, our movement should not negotiate against ourselves.

When Amazon threatened our construction sisters and brothers jobs. Some in the labor movement were correctly very concerned.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And she said, Absolutely not. We got to be moving much closer to this 200, 400 million regional investment. So that's my goal. I'm concerned that we're really close with the spending plan, but I would still like to have the mayor weigh in on this with a Human Services Department.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Or if there's not, I understand, but that would inform my opinion about how to vote today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think there's a couple. So just said clearly, answer your question. No, I'm not interested in holding the resolution over for another two weeks. And we have I'm we have made a motion. It has been seconded. And so my expectation is that we deal with that motion first before any other motion is introduced related to this'",

So I will just say that this is a spending plan that in structure has not fundamentally changed from identified categories of investment from the base ordinance that we introduced in March.

        "'speaker_1': 'at a 275 per FTE taxation rate. But the priorities represented here have not fundamentally shifted since we first introduced this bill. So I, you know, really from my perspective, the only thing has changed is how much we're funding in those buckets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the buckets themselves have not changed significantly, if at all, since we introduced introduced the bill. And so I continue to be supportive of of advancing this through our process today. And and I think that the how we have allocated the dollars in terms of 60% for housing and 40% for immediate shelter, housing and services, strikes, strikes'",
        "'speaker_1': ', the right balance in that has effectively been the models from the get go. And back then it was 75% in housing and 20% in in human health services. So we've we've allocated an additional 20% of the funding to the immediate shelter, housing and services in response to some of the concerns and requests that we've heard from councilmembers'",
        "'speaker_1': ', including yourself, to have a more significant investment in those immediate shelter, housing services buckets. And we feel like I feel like we have been responsive to that request and that that is reflected in the spending plan that is attached to this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oak Cliff Councilmember Becky shows and. Q Thank.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You. Thank you. The one thing I noticed, Councilmember Gonzales, is that we have not yet addressed the 184 permanent supportive housing and transition housing beds that will go offline. And this current model also does not address the 240 new shelter beds and the 454 shelter beds that will go offline for a net loss of 214 shelter beds'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So I'm not arguing that your buckets aren't correct. I don't feel like we've just nailed the numbers, and that's all I'm asking for. Well, is for us to dove in and make sure that we all are in agreement on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I also really want to appreciate and acknowledge the fact that we we want to have more of the mental health behavioral health approach. And to be clear that we are investing in that so we can move people off the streets into healthy places.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are my concerns. Not that I don't think that we've moved a long way. We have and like Councilmember Johnson says, there's a lot to like. And I want to make sure we're all in agreement on that.'",

Councilmember, back door to your term point and in your committee, I know we have a lot of work to do to address'",
        "'speaker_5': 'some of the shelters that are going to go offline. But these dollars, in my mind, are supposed to be in addition to the conversation that we're already having and we're trying to make sure that we're trying to make sure that we both hear from the social workers, those who are experiencing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The housing advocates and experts have all said what we need most is the creation of housing units. And right now we don't have the funding to do that. So the the the spending plan in front of you has approximately 65% of the funds really being prioritized into housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And given that this is a resolution, I think it sets out a very clear statement about our priorities. In terms of process, I am hoping that through the implementation plan, through the committee committee discussion, we will be able to get into some some of those additional details.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. President, if I might also there's two other components on the spending plan that I think require some urgency and attention as well. We talked a little bit earlier about the vulnerable community members who are experiencing homelessness and on the verge of falling into homelessness, being served by individuals who they themselves may be homeless or about to'",

We cannot create stability for a community if the workforce that provides those services doesn't have the stability that they need to stay in that job.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I appreciate the incredible work that's gone into making sure that we're beginning to address this. There is obviously a sly statement of legislative intent that the council worked on last year. There's the audit that Councilmember Gonzalez has championed with HRC to make sure that we can get a better understanding of how we can better stabilize the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'workforce. I think that the recognition that the spending plan puts into place is that we have to stop the bleeding and that we need to have a longer term solution. But this is a down payment in that attempt to create true workforce stability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also know that there is our navigation team informs us that we need to be able to provide immediate shelter for those who are on the street right now, for people with pets and belongings and couples, people who want to feel safe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we need to quickly open shelters, which I know, Councilmember Ragsdale, you and I share. We have got to create safe and warm places for folks to go. But the reason that I think we see 65% of the funding really going to capital projects is because the long term is to get folks out of shelter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that's what that's what this spending plan reflects. And lastly, I just want to thank again the Council for your support earlier in conversations. I know we haven't voted on it yet, but I got some very positive feedback from many of you for the capital projects that I have been working on in Section three here'",
        "'speaker_5': '. The amendment on page six really does provide an intent that our council will work to identify ways for this spending plan, to mirror our commitment to building housing with workforce agreements that include priority hire, prevailing wage, and making necessary adjustments so that we can have more apprenticeship utilization requirements on these incredible housing projects that were that we're'",
        "'speaker_5': 'building. This comes directly from feedback that we heard from workers themselves on the front line, from labor leaders. And I think it is it's about listening to folks putting pen to paper and crafting policies that we will stay true to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But. Will require a lot of work. So I understand this is a resolution, but I do believe that it sets forth our values. And I would love to be able to move this out today with your support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, guys, very much. Data. Councilman Herbold, were you in queue?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am in the queue. Thank you. I just want to speak to my.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Support for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This resolution and the accompanying spending plan. I want to do so with reflecting on what specifically we are looking for from the executive in an implementation plan on or before December 14th. That implementation plan will include proposed outcomes for each funded program or service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How the programs or services will be implemented. Propose policies for implemented funding, funded programs or services, as well as a proposal for an oversight committee. The most important are some other requirements, but I think the most important part of this as it relates to this particular conversation is part of the implementation plan will be a specific spending'",
        "'speaker_1': 'proposal for years, one through five of the new business tax. And so I think that element is particularly important as it relates to the fact that this is a values document. It's not a to the penny how the money is going to be spent document.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those are the conversations that we're going to be having once we receive a proposed implementation plan from from the executive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Herbold, Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I will also be supporting this amendment. I think that this is a great step in the right direction. I want to highlight that two thirds of the funding over the five years will be going towards additional affordable housing, which is a priority customer base.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate you identifying that there are some gaps. Clearly, when we stepped down from 75 million to under $50 million, we leave a bunch of gaps. And you highlighted some I know there are a bunch others. And frankly, I'm going to be looking for the mayor to figure out how to fill those gaps as we go forward'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But we need to build affordable housing, there's no question there. And so I think that needs to continue to be prioritized. I look forward to the work that we will all be doing in the coming months as we move towards implementation of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Any further comments? I'll just sort of signal, folks. I think a lot of work and a lot of thought with behind this spending plan. And for that, I appreciate it. And I agree that it is somewhat high level and gives us some wiggle room as we think about what investments make sense now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would agree that it hasn't changed dramatically from the initial base legislation. My concerns is my concern is more of a process issue. And that is this is a new revenue stream, about 237 million over five years, as we all know, roughly about $50 million a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if there's one thing I don't think we've I personally don't think we've convinced the public is that our plan is a is the right plan or a strategic. And we are pulling on the resources of all around us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We might there might be real estate expertize or software developers who could lend us a hand and there might be other types of extra. For example, I think someone giggled. Someone talked about developing at their cost in a system by which on a second's notice we could look at all the available shelter, what needs a person has'",
        "'speaker_0': ', and how that particular unit could match with that particular person on a real time basis. They would develop that at their time. And so that kind of thinking outside the box, given the fact that I think this revenue stream will not get implemented till next year, that I don't see why a few weeks or even a few'",
        "'speaker_0': 'months for that matter, why we wouldn't take advantage of it. It seems very apparent that a lot of my colleagues are very supportive and willing to move forward with this resolution. I get that. So I think it will pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if I had my druthers, we would be a little more strategic and take a little more time, given the fact that we just voted on what the revenue amounts were going to be a few minutes ago. But having said that, I think we are ready to vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let's see, we have a resolution follow of this. So this is just an amendment. So an amendment number two has been moved. And second, it all those and correct amendment number two. So I'm referring to okay, amendment number two has been moved to second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all those in favor, please say I and raise your hand, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those opposed. Say no one. Raise your hand. No. So what does that five do for the amendment passes and now. I think we have should we take councilmember from our resolution now? So I'll refer that as an amendment number three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember Swansea, you like to introduce resolution amendment number three and please describe it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do I have to move it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can move it and get second and then we can go from there. We could formally move it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In Amendment three now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amendment number three is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Like to move Amendment three for consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, it's been moved in Second Amendment. Everything's and moved in second. And please describe the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Josh I just want to recognize that what we're discussing right now is a nonbinding resolution. And ultimately, the decisions that council will make during the budget season in the fall will be the more legally binding decision. But the direction provided by the resolution will be used by the council gone budget time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I hope that the Council will vote to redirect funding away from the inhumane and ineffective policy of sweeps at that time and use those millions. And use those millions instead to build quality, affordable housing units and for services that actually work for homeless community members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When we discussed the sweep of the Ribbon Awards in my committee meeting a couple of weeks ago, I was really struck by how many times the same people had been swept. The residents of the Ramona encampment who presented at the table said they had been swept from that one location five times in the last year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A real change vendor who spoke that same day in public comments said he had been swept eight times. These millions of dollars are not getting people into any kind of better situation. They simply move them from one, accept unacceptable location to another.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And every time a sweep happens. These human beings, let's remember, they are human beings. They lose their belongings. Every time there's a sweep, you lose everything you have. There are many residents who came. It was really poignant when they were talking about how their belongings, things that they used to make a living off of were just a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'pile, you know, a three foot pile of garbage by the time they but by the time the sweep was done and it actually said, are homeless community members worse to be worse off, not better off to get out of homelessness?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Even the people who support the sweeps and I understand that some actually some genuine people might be supporting it because they don't know what else can be done. But even you have to recognize that they haven't been effective.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've had millions of dollars spent on sweeps every single year. Has that addressed homelessness? No. I mean, regardless of what side you're on ideologically, I think you you should recognize that data. It's not working. It hasn't worked. And so and the reason it's not working is because we're talking about human beings who cannot who cannot simply disappear'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and who should not have to simply disappear. They have to go somewhere. This amendment, to put it in very simple terms, says in there, as in the resolution, that none of the revenues that will be raised through the tax that we just voted on a few minutes ago could be used for sweeps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think. I think any of the revenues from the tax were used for the sweeping of homeless people. It would be a real slap in the face to the homeless activists and advocates who have put so much time into building a movement to raise funds for affordable housing, to then turn around and use that money instead to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'harass and harm them with escalated sweeps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilor Swan. This motion has been moved and this amendment has been moved. And second. And then any further comments about Councilmember Swans amendment? Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you to the issue of the city's practices regarding encampment removals. I do agree that the current practices aren't working. They're not working for people. They're not working for for communities living around encampments. But I want to speak to the fact that this council endorsed a work plan for monitoring and oversight of the city's encampment removal policies'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in in late November. Through the budget process and through that budget process, we voted to first move the work of the navigation team to the Human Services Department with an understanding that by having the Human Services Department oversee this work, we can be assured that these practices will be done with more of a person centered approach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Last month we received a report from the Human Services Department and FARC where they were. This work is currently how housed on how they intend to do that. We need to talk more about what the Human Services Department and FARC proposed to do, and we will.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Secondly, we voted to receive weekly reports for the following weeks encampment removal. So we receive a report in advance of all of the activities of the navigation teams one week in advance. We receive them every week. We review them, discuss them in in council committee, share them with advocates who document the city's practices and share their critiques'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of those practices with us. Thirdly, we voted to reform the practices and desired outcomes of the navigation teams consistent with a theory of change that was prepared by the city auditor. We will also hear the recommendations consistent with this theory of change next month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So again, our efforts to reform the practices related to encampment removals is is much of what what city hall does is incremental and iterative. And I know that that's frustrating. And I know when we're talking about people's lives, it is particularly frustrating.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is an approach that that we agreed to take. Finally, the Office of Civil Rights in their 2017 monitoring report has recommendations for changes in the encampment removal policies that I will be hearing in my committee later this month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then finally, I just want to note that although the orders allow those are the encampment removal policies allow for immediate removal of encampments that are obstructions or in the right of way or in parks. The practices that the cities actually follows for those encampments is to also, despite what the policies allow them to do, is, is'",
        "'speaker_1': ', is to also give prior notice, outreach and storage of personal property. In this way, the executive has voluntarily agreed to shift from their own practices that allow for immediate removal. This is the course that we agreed to to monitor these practices five months ago, and it's the course I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Support continuing to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Herbold, Councilwoman Mosquito.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As you began the conversation about the spending plan, one of the things that I think you said that was so powerful is we are looking for unity and not creating division unnecessarily. And I think the unified message that just came from council a minute ago was that we all agree that we need additional'",
        "'speaker_5': 'progressive revenue to create housing and provide services to those who are homeless. But I, I want to make it very clear, I do not support sweeps. I cannot support sweeping people from corner to corner. It is not a way to treat folks humanely and with respect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we want to treat people with respect and dignity that they deserve, they themselves, their possessions, their pets, their loved ones. The best way to do that is by building housing. The best way to do that is by investing in shelter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the best way to make sure that we create permanent supportive housing is to stay focused on the plan and really making sure that we provide input on it. But to to to underscore what we just did was we built the housing and shelter necessary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it's a distraction to think that well, I think it's a false dichotomy that when there is actually none, when we create the housing and shelter necessary, then we will ask folks in a respectful way to go inside.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can't support this amendment, though, because I think it goes slightly counter to what we just said. The best way to make sure that we're respecting folks is by creating the housing and shelter that we need. So I am hopeful that we will be able to get to a90 vote on an implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am hopeful that will have unanimous, unanimous support. Or on this type of resolution when it comes forward. But I think that what we need to send a message out to the community is the best way to get folks off the street is not by sweetening them, but by putting them into shelters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm voting no on this amendment because I think that we need to stay focus on building those shelters and housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Casper Mosquito. Okay. I think we are soon going to close debate on the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate all the details that were provided about how the rules should be followed and all the monitoring that the council and the mayor's office are, or at least the mayor's office is supposed to be doing. Unfortunately, the cases that all the monitoring was in effect when the Ravenna sweep happened recently, and I support all the work'",
        "'speaker_6': 'continuing to better monitor the work that is happening in the form of sweeps. However, I think it is important for the Council to state its intent that if you're against sweep in all these beaches I've indicated they're against sweep.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why then why don't you just vote an amendment that is against sweeps? I don't understand that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And and as.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I said before, this is a non-binding resolution. Our work will not be done. I mean, I don't expect this amendment to pass, but even if it passed, our work would not have been done. The real work will have to come after ah, after this, you know, after you all take a breather, because we're all exhausted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it will come during the people's budget movement. As you know, this the question of sweeps became a big issue because our movement, people's budget movement last year made this an issue. It put us on the map of Seattle politics.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But here I think we're talking about something very specific. Specific. We now have a new revenue source, a progressive revenue source. Sweeps need to be stopped, not expanded with a now a new revenue source. And I do not agree at all that there's a false dichotomy between supporting affordable housing and stating your intent that sweeps are wrong'",
        "'speaker_6': '. As a matter of fact, there's a false dichotomy between, say, between building affordable housing and saying that are not willing to take a stand against sweeps. If sweeps need to stop, then take a stand that sweeps need to stop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay. Okay. Amendments. Number three has been properly moved and second, as stated by Kasperowicz want all those in favor of amendment number three? Say I and raise your hand. All the polls say no and raise your hand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. So the amendment fails. So now we have a resolution. Let me describe what we're going to do. We are going to vote on a resolution that has been amended at least the first time regarding the new spending plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is ready for vote. The entire resolution is ready to vote. Okay. So. I will see you after. Tough to move it. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will move. Resolution 31810 as amended.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor of it. Please say hi and raise your hand. And all those opposed to it. Say no and raise your hand. No. Two, five, four. So it passes. Five, four. Okay. And I was chair was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sign it. Okay. We've come to the end of our June. Is there any further business going for the council to help us? Okay, thank you, everyone. Have a great day. And we stand adjourned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's only 454. Well done.'"
