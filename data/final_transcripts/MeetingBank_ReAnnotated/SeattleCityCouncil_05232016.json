In terms of those that are in the school buildings, we are creating a circuit selection and enrollment priority for children eligible to continue in this in that school for that particular kindergarten'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I have a question of just reading, not looking at the bill itself. Reading at some notes on the bill. I have a description of the amendment that removes the requirement for organizations to provide two or more classrooms. Can you explain that for me?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have obviously, we've all heard about the very dire space needs that are that's created when there are competing needs for school classroom size. And I just want to have a better understanding on how this amendment deals with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. So one of the challenges that we had where some providers had two locations, but they're spread apart in the city, they're not in the same building. And what we found is by requiring each one to have two, there could be someone that just has one that we really want to capture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we thought that the imposition that they have two locations by by eliminating that we could actually capture more good providers that are out there as we expand this program. So we thought it was to some extent sort of artificial because again, a provider with two or three locations, they may be all over the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the thinking that we wanted them in one location truly turned out to be not necessarily needed. Can I add? So as a means to expand for those providers? Yes. Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I could just add on to that. So one of the things that we heard from Diehl when they came in and made the presentation around this particular issue, is that it could prohibit that two classrooms minimum requirement could prohibit organizations like the Hosea Marta Daycare Preschool program that's at its center like myself, from participating in our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'preschool program because they only have one classroom, for example. Right. So I think it's I think there's a couple of different things. I think that there's certainly space restrictions that are in play when we're talking about pre-K classrooms in within the Seattle Public School System Framework.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But then there are all the others who aren't part of the who aren't using space at public schools that are being sort of overly restricted by this particular limit that would otherwise be able to participate but aren't able to because they just don't have more than one classroom.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this this amendment isn't designed to address the capacity issues. It's designed to allow for more expansion in those organizations that have the room for an expansion into their facilities. But it it doesn't it it doesn't. It's it's the ID of the the the room within their facilities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Without a look at how many students are going to be actually using the the rooms. It's a capacity sort of a it's it's not based on whether or not there is physical space within a facility. It's just the desire to be able to move into a program that wishes to provide the service.'",
