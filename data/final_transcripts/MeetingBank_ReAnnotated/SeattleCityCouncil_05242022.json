        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Yes, Council President. We should take a vote on the amendment. And then following that, then we'll take a vote on the resolution as amended or is not amended, depending on what happens with the vote on the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if that Madam Clerk, were you, please call the role on the proposed amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To its present order. Yes. Just clarifying that this is amendment as showing attachment or item three on legislator. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, it's amendment A, version one two, resolution 32050 SPD staffing incentives. And once we move that and then Councilmember Nelson can speak to that. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm seeing Amendment One, version one to D two. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The committee looking at the committee amendments, not the circulated amendment from earlier today. Yeah. But the point of order, I believe Amendment eight was distributed via email prior to noon today, and that is what I understand we're voting on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to make sure I'm following the right amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. It came from Craig Goss and today, amendment a version one. Speedy staffing incentives. And Councilmember Nelson is amending a recital which are the two sticks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So tell me to clean it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So, Madam Clerk, to elect council member Nelson, explain it and then we go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are no further comments. A vote would be taken. Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know, but I need to have Councilmember Nelson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Explain the amendment before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The vote. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I thought she had. So excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She kind of spoke to the resolution, but not the amendment. So go ahead, Kilburn, to speak to your amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yep. Thank you very much. I'm sorry I did that backwards. Basically, I wrote this a long time ago in early March. And so the amendments are simply updating one recital, the fifth recital to reflect the the numbers in the May 12th shots fired report, which shows that gun fatalities increased 100% compared to year to date to 2021'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And the Second Amendment is to the eighth recital, which changes the response types in the current median response time to priority nine when when calls is 7.3 minutes and the current median response time to priority to nine on one calls is 22.9 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So those are the two amendments I made with new information from the department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Are there any questions for Councilmember Nelson regarding her proposed amendment? Okay. Not seen any. Will please call the role on the amendment. The proposed amendment. Councilmember Strauss. Yes. Councilmember Herbold? Yes. Councilmember Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Morales. No. Councilmember Mosqueda now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Spoke.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Nelson, I. Councilmember Peterson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council councilmember want. Yes. Council president. Whereas. Yes. Seven in favor. Two opposed. Thank you. So the motion carries the amended is adopted in the amendment. The amended resolution is now before the council. So if there's anyone that wants to speak to the amended resolution, this is the this is your opportunity to speak to Council Member Nelson's amended'",
        "'speaker_0': 'resolution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'House version.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I will be voting no on this resolution relating related to reestablishing hiring bonuses for the Seattle Police Department. I will also be voting no on the next item, which is a related ordinance. And I just wanted to clarify for the members of the public who are watching, I voted yes on the amendment to the resolution'",
        "'speaker_0': 'because it was just related to a factual correction to the text of the resolution. Those are shocking double standard when the political establishment advocates for hiring bonuses in the Seattle Police Department. The police have been some of the highest paid people among Seattle employees, making more than double what is paid to social workers like homeless service workers'",
        "'speaker_0': ', corporate politicians and indeed, most of the city council members have claimed and in the past and continue claiming that they cannot open homeless shelters and dining villages because there are not enough homeless service workers to staff new spaces.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when there are hiring bonuses or just a decent wage, where the hiring bonuses or just a decent wage increase. For the impoverished homeless service workers who actually helped people turn their lives around. There isn't any I mean, I don't remember when we had a vote on hiring bonuses for social service workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For years, the city's Democratic Party establishment has used the police contract as an excuse for failing to hold officers accountable. Yet here we are. After months of contract negotiations with the Seattle Police Officers, Guild and Council members are offering the police extra money without an agreement on accountability in a new contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What other contract negotiations are treated like this where we're essentially saying we'll give you the money first and ask for an agreement and accountability next or not at all. It is completely ridiculous. This is these are not the actions of elected officials who want to increase police accountability regardless of the words they might use.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are the actions of a political establishment that desperately wants an excuse to say that police brutality is beyond their control. Not much they can do about it. They can, you know, hold forth on it and make speeches.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but in reality, they are they're admitting that they have no way forward to address the serious lapses in accountability and the serious problems, ongoing problems in the police department. These are the actions of the Democratic establishment that wants to distract from their abject refusal to address the housing and homelessness crisis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The amount of police funding does not have any statistical impact on the degree of public safety in a community. Public safety is a real issue in Seattle. I absolutely share the concerns that ordinary people have about the rise in gun violence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is no doubt that this needs to be addressed. However. Data systematically show that it is reducing inequality and providing affordable housing and living wage jobs, affordable services, including childcare that has the greatest statistical impact. Also, what has an impact is well-funded public schools with well-funded afterschool programs and avenues for young people and community members to engage'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in that. And if you look at data, you would see that this is happening, even though the increase in crime and the concerns with public safety, all of this is happening, even though the police budget has been bloated for many years, while the social services and affordable housing that working people rest, communities and the poor need continue'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to be gravely underfunded. And at the same time, we know that rents are skyrocketing. Studies show overwhelmingly that the best and really only solution to public safety issues is to fund the needs of our society to address crime, and particularly to stop crimes before they even happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to fund housing. We need to increase wages and end worker exploitation, not increase repression. And as far as the police are concerned, what we urgently need is an elected community oversight committee with full powers over the police, including hiring and firing and subpoena powers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For all those reasons, I will be voting no on this resolution and the ordinance, which is the next agenda item. Thank you. If you ever saw one. Are there any other comments? Okay. Councilmember Herbal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to make a comment at some of the amendments in committee clarified that a incentive or bonus program would have to come back to council for our adoption. And I think the sponsor of the resolution might have one idea of what an incentive program looks like, but that hasn't been settled.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would not assume that the mayor's office is going to be bringing us a package that necessarily includes traditional hiring bonuses, where we write a check to somebody to thank them for agreeing to come and work in the city of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My understanding of what the mayor's office is looking at is a different approach for addressing our recruitment issues and and our retention issues and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Retention of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Funding. Retention programs very likely will have to be bargained. So just because we talk about an intent to consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Recommendation that is going to come to us later doesn't mean that we're giving a blank check for it. And so I think it's just really important to be clear on what this particular resolution does and doesn't do and where it allows for continued dialog and debate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would really urged us not to harden our positions around this this issue. We did vote for a hiring plan that we're not going to meet. And if you supported that hiring plan in November, I would hope that you would support addressing the reasons why we're not going to going to meet it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, again, I really I'm hoping that people, as we continue these discussions, keep an open mind. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before we move on. Councilor Herbert, thank you for, as usual, very straightforward and candid comments about how this came out of committee and what the the timeline here has been. We've been discussing this for a while, and you're right, we did vote back in November and December.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But anyway, are there any other questions before we move to a vote? Customers get it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Madam President. And I think, unfortunately, what we're seeing with this resolution in front of us is that we are going to be okay with less funding being available at the end of the year for 2023 and 2024.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Priorities, priorities like investments in mental health, something that we spent a good portion of the beginning of this meeting speaking about in terms of the importance of this investment, especially in the wake of so much trauma, hardship and death and injury over the last two years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know that there's increased needs across our community, and responding to public safety crises requires a multifaceted approach. We have, again, fully funded the hiring plan, as requested by the Seattle Police Department. The question is not whether or not these funds are available and if we should use them for this purpose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is if these funds are going to be available in the midst of this crisis that we're having on a budget crisis, how are we planning to prioritize investments for our city? I think that it's important to look holistically at the budget dollars available at the end of this year to invest those into strategies that we know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'upstream work to help reduce harm and trauma, to invest in mental health priorities, to make sure that there's alternative systems so that officers who are armed with a gun and a badge are not always the first responders who have to show up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So much work has been done. And I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for her leadership on that, both in budget conversations and in her policy conversations in committee. I think the important opportunity in front of us is to look at the amount of funding at the end of this year and truly make investments in upstream priorities for'",
        "'speaker_2': '2023 2024. Right now we have a budget proviso that is in place and if we go the route of exploring this resolution and the upcoming piece of legislation, then we are making early decisions about what is a bigger priority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're making those decisions according to this resolution for investments in broad swath, investments in hiring strategies. While the original intent was clearly focused on hiring bonuses and the sponsor has and has made it clear she doesn't care what policies this funds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do care. And I do care that what's been recommended by our city family from the recruitment and retention workgroup, their final report, which included members of the Human Resources Department and the Seattle Police Department, they did not identify hiring incentives as a recommended strategy to addressing recruitment or retention.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, I think it's important to look at how we can utilize every dollar available at the end of this year and invest those and strategies in 2023 and 2024 to create a whole host of public safety investments that will create healthier communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we're interested in what it might look like to improve retention and recruitment strategies, including at Seattle Police Department, then we would be talking about investments in the in the budget coming up that look at what the Human Resources Department actually prioritized.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they made four recommendations, none of which were related to hiring incentives. They focused on, number one, a focus on leveraging technological solutions. Number two, revise business practices and engaging candidates during the hiring process. Number three, advance top talent quickly through the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And four, extend offers more quickly in a more competitive timeframe. These are the strategies that come from within our own city department. And so in the midst of this crisis, where we are telling every single department in 2022 to hold on critical investments, things like public restrooms and outreach and education for domestic workers, we're asking folks to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hold on investments that this council has prioritized along with priorities from the executive team. And we're asking the departments, as you heard from Julie Dingley, our city budget director, in our May 4th meeting in the Finance Committee, to be prepared for up to a 6% reduction across the board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am very concerned about a resolution that authorizes us to go down a path of asking for us to invest in something that's either A, not recommended and B, not proven. Now, again, it was there was some data suggested earlier that this is a proven strategy to invest in incentive programs generally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But let me quote, Madam President, from the statement of legislative intent CBO 013a002, which is from last year's budget process, that asked the departments to look at a citywide hiring incentive impact analysis, to look at exactly the speedy incentives that were offered in the fall of last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the report from the statement of legislative intent says hiring incentives are a short term strategy to attract more applicants. The city began offering incentives in October 2021 for certain public safety positions. Again, not authorized by the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a different topic. It says the Seattle Police Department did not. Experience an increase in hiring since implementing a hiring incentive into their process in October 2021. While it goes on to talk about how the hiring pool for the Community Safety and Communication Center did increase, it could not say that hiring incentives or a strategy for increasing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'retention. So we don't have recent data saying that this is a good practice. We don't have specifics in this resolution on what it would go towards, and nor has there been any legislative intent since the beginning of this discussion about actually investing in what the Coalition for City Unions are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Existing city workers want and what they want is to make sure that they're feeling respected and cared for in this time. The Coalition for City Unions, our city frontline workers have expressed exactly what the Human Resources Department said that there would be serious.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unrest, distrust, feelings of resentment. If those who are being hired knew to come into our city are given incentives or bonuses or some sort of encouragement to come, when we're not looking at better pay within our own city, when we're not looking at strategies for recruitment and retention among diverse workforce, when we're not investing more in apprenticeship'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and internship opportunities that already exist in our city. Those are the strategies that our own city workers want. So I'll be voting no on this resolution. I will be voting no on it for a myriad of reasons. As you've heard me talk about before, because of the city shortfall in the budget that we're experiencing and the need'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to use these dollars at the end of this year. Number two, because this was not part of a list of recommendations that came from the Human Resources Department and the workgroup that included the Seattle Police Department. And number three, because I think that there's investments that we could be using with these precious dollars if they are available'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at the end of the year or upstream investments. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in the legislation coming. But you again, want to underscore my concern about us moving in a direction that has not proven, recommended or frankly requested from our own frontline workers and city staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So any other comments or concerns? Okay. Councilmember Nelson and then Councilmember Peterson and then we're going to move on to the next agenda item. Go ahead. So I think that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It really comes down to do we prioritize public safety or not? Pure and simple. And I have already touched on all the other things that we can do to support city community development. Ways of addressing safety in communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, in I believe that in 2021 Council spent $29 million or so on the implementation of the Equitable Community Investment Task Force's recommendations for REC investments. So what we're talking about really is using the money that is already in the police budget and they can't hire, they won't meet their hiring plan because they're having a hard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'time because they aren't able to recruit. So let me just read something from the central staff memo from 20 from May 10th. Since 2020, SPD incurred a net loss of 255 police officers. Actually, it was 400 total and then there were some hires.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'During that time, SPG transferred more than 100 officers from specialty, investigative and other units to 911 response to address Spd's goals for response times in patrol coverage. The transfers required that they won disband problem solving community police teams and precinct based anti-crime teams to reduce the number of officers on bike and foot beats from 55 to 4'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and reduce investigation in specialty units below prior staffing levels. So if we want to get guns off the street and the drugs that are causing the overdoses, we see everywhere, we actually do have to make sure that there are enough officers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like I said, this is not either or and this is not taking money away from your other priorities. I would say that this van making that point is another version of defunding CPD for other priorities in other departments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is what we hear the public saying, that they want to feel safer in their communities. And this is one way to go about that. And you're right, I do. I am ambivalent about the whatever staffing incentive programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as you'll hear in discussion about Council's Councilmember Herbold Council Bill, there was collaboration between me and and Councilmember Herbold and the mayor about what could be spent most effectively to destroy, to begin a more robust recruitment process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So like I said, I leave it to the pros to figure out that. I think I just simply say that we have got to do something about the emergency that we're facing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Casanova Nelson. We're done. And Councilor Peterson. And then we will go to a vote. Ezra Petersen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you. Council President Juarez. I just wanted to. Note that Mayor Harrell helped to. Broker this compromise and this collaboration. And so these two things go together, the resolution of the council bill. I want to thank Councilmember Nelson for this resolution and for her role for her ordinance, because what I hear from my constituents is a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'concern about the loss of the hundreds of officers. And we're all trying to take a holistic approach to community safety. And to do that, we have to also recognize that piece of it, which is trying to restore and bring in some new officers and train them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we want to reform the police contract. We're going to do more upstream programs. We're going to we're going to try to do it in a comprehensive manner. And Mayor Harrell's leadership is going to be key to this as as we're seeing today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Charles Marie Lewis. And then we're going to move on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think you council president. So I just want to put it in the context a little bit, given our discussion today. Right. Like we're not. This resolution is not the be all, end all. The only public safety plan that is before the city of Seattle to completely restore community safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not a significant or at least the ordinance that's attached to it is not in the scheme of all of our public safety spending, a significant, overwhelming investment in terms of what we're unlocking today for the executive part of the deal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the reason I just want to highlight that is there is a lot more that we need to do in collaboration with Mayor Harold to focus holistically on the public safety situation that the city is facing. You know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That we've been citing at various stages in this discussion today. 92% of our neighbors indicated mental health services to be the biggest thing that they thought would be outcome determinative for public safety. I completely agree with that finding from the poll.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I was polled, I would have said the same thing. It's critical that as we work with the executive to get more promulgated initiatives, that we really make sure we're focusing on those lower acuity responses and also places, as we discussed in the Public Safety Committee this morning, for people to go and have some version of inpatient'",
        "'speaker_1': 'assistance or easy access, transitional housing, like what U.S. care does with their hotel shelters. And, you know, I'd be remiss just very quickly not highlight. Right. Like Denver and Eugene have very mature programs that have been doing this for years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cities from Saint Louis to Fort Worth to Portland, Oregon, are experimenting with these kinds of programs. And as we are looking toward how we can continue to invest, underspend, salary, savings, whatever else, I would just encourage the Herold ministration to work in collaboration with the Council on initiatives like that to also try to meet the crisis of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the safety situation in the city. I would also just add, you know, Mayor Harold and his administration has emphasized many times to this council and on the campaign trail that he is interested in developing responses like that that will be part of the comprehensive public safety plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in voting for this today, we're not rejecting other things. We're just highlighting that police recruitment and retention has to be part of a comprehensive public safety strategy. But I just wanted to emphasize that I fully expect the Harold administration to promulgate additional proposals to us in line with low acuity, first response and public health interventions like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'behavioral mental health services. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And since this is I apologize, Councilmember Nelson, I will let you have the last word and then we'll move to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hear you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm coming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know. So another way of putting it is simply that resolutions are policy statements of intent. They don't carry the force of law, but they do communicate our priorities. And this resolution signals to the vast pool of potential recruits out there that Seattle is simply upping its game and ready to compete with our neighboring jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It demonstrates to our own officers that we value the work that they do, and we're trying to get them some support. So it's not so hard to do their job because they're stretched really thin. And it it most importantly, I think it tells our constituents that we're listening, that we hear their concerns, and and we're just committed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to putting their safety first. That's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. So with that councilmembers, will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of the resolution as amended? Councilmember Strauss. Councilmember Strauss Strauss, are you there?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Sorry. Audio problems? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Herbold? Yes. Councilmember Lewis?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Morales. No. Councilmember ROSQUETA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No.'",

The resolution is adopted as amended, and the chair will sign it. And Madam Clerk, please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf and accept Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The count was wrong. It was added six in favor, three opposed. I'm sorry, 6 to 3, but it's still there. It does pass is adopted as amended. Okay. Thank you. So with that, folks, we will go back to item number eight and that is Councilmember Herbold.'",

    "Amendment of Seattle Police Department Budget Proviso.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Agenda Item eight Council Bill 120320 An ordinance relating to appropriations for the Seattle Police Department, amending a proviso imposed by Ordinance 126490, which adopted the 2022 budget and ratifying confirming certain prior acts. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. Thing to work on the 2022 budget, the council requested a report from the executive on a citywide hiring incentive program analyzing the vacancy issues across front line workers. Vacancy issues that are creating a service issue with the public or inhibiting the movement from fulfilling a core function.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Report we received indicated that for a number of positions that department struggled to fill the positions that are important to city business, not just including police officers, but also carpenters, truck drivers, the civil engineers and firemen dispatchers. Consequently, this bill requests the Department of Human Resources amend its personnel rules so that we can give appointing authorities of'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Current personnel rules limit this flexibility only our pay bands such as department directors. So if we're doing national recruiting to fill positions in departments all over the city, I think it's important that we look at paying costs associated with folks moving here, do public service on behalf of City of Seattle so that the bill is also to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'release the proviso on spending for the Seattle Police Department. Frankly, some people were testifying to not supporting hiring incentives for officers. But I just want to clarify again, this proposal allows for offering payment of moving costs for new hires again to fill hard to hire positions in several departments, not only the Seattle Police Department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The release of the funding is not needed for the other departments because unlike the Seattle Police Department, they can use funds from position vacancies. Once the Human Resources Department changes the rules, allowing hiring authorities to pay the relocation expenses of recruits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is not a case for the Seattle Police Department, and it's not the case only because of the existing proviso. That's why the legislation releases $650,000 of existing city funds for SPD for this use. It is not new funding for CPD and it is only to allow SPD to do what we are trying to allow other departments'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to do as well. There are already funds in the budget to support salaries associated with speedy hiring and to hire 125 officers, also funded in the 2022 budget modified to 98 new hires. Releasing this funding would work to assist with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, with this hiring and with I think again, it makes sense given the earlier action support hiring plan was amended in committee to add funding for a campaign to help.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think that council member Nelson Herbert had to be encouraged or there was some kind of brokering. I think council member Herbold, because of Nelson, were incredibly staid in their comments, in their positions, but also committed to working collaboratively, building consensus, working with the executive.'",

I consider her a thought partner, not only in how we address public safety, but how we continue to invest in alternative responses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know I know she cares very much about the policy details, much, much to the knowledge of every person who watches committee meetings.

Excuse me, I'm not opposed to moving fees being paid for in general.

        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to lift up some of the things that we talked about in committee that is underscoring sort of the need, I believe, for a pause for us to look more generally at retention and recruitment strategies. Nationally, we are seeing a downward trend in police departments, staffing levels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cities like Atlanta, Phenix, Philly have all seen hundreds of officers leave the force. Philadelphia is down 440 officers. Atlanta down 400 to 500 officers in the last three years. New York saw 5300 officers leave since 2020, Louisville lost 233 officers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Portland is the police force is now under 1100 officers from where they started. So thanks to you very much, Surya Basu on my staff who has done incredible research and has pulled this information from Forbes article in late April, this is the trend across our country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that more broadly, instead of investing in just a hiring bonus strategy or a PR firm to do outreach for a police chief or for a recruit. To try to get more people to apply to a position where we are seeing national trends and downward staffing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would much more prefer to be having a conversation at the end of the year about where precious and limited resources can go. And to not list a proviso now so that we have more resources especially and resources available for upstream investments that don't require an officer and a badge to show up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And lastly, Madam President, in our many meetings that we've had, we've talked about how some of the strategies, almost all of the strategies that we have invested in and community resources are a retention strategy for officers. We just need to continue to get those dollars out the door that are currently sitting there and work in partnership with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those community partners so that there's more mental health service providers and community responders available that can help with retention strategies.

So again, lifting a proviso at this point for specifically SBT and not knowing what the underspend is in other departments, other departments who will be offering moving fees as well as the Coalition for Setting Units noted, creates an inequity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is not unknown. There is not a known answer to whether or not there is going to be the same hiring bonus excuse me, the same moving fee offered to individuals across departments and they raise concerns about equity and parity across departments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I raise that question during committee. I have not seen a response yet, so to date I'm still concerned about that. Again, I'll be voting no on this piece of legislation in front of us, though I appreciate the sponsors hard work to try to broaden out more holistically how we are looking at retention to our city family generally'",

And as Councilmember Muscadet just said, this isn't a problem that's unique to Seattle, an experience that's happening across the country. And in fact, the department's own response to the statement of legislative intent or this council bill, council budget action was inconclusive on whether a hiring bonus had'",

And further, the impact of the hiring bonus, as has already been said, could cause deeper cultural problems in a department that is struggling with culture change.

        "'speaker_0': 'accountability and culture change in the police department. There is need for culture change within the department. Lack of officers is a retention and management issue. The Recruitment and Retention Workshop found that sergeants are promoted based on test results with no real consideration given to whether they can actually manage people.'",

They were literally turned away at the door. And the Seattle Times reported on May 5th that officers routinely disobeyed direct orders from chieftains to wear masks and to observe social distancing protocols.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there is definitely a culture problem, and hiring bonuses is not going to solve that. It's not going to solve the management issue either. And there are the fiscal constraints that we're under and the fact that we hear regularly that we need data and evidence to support our funding decisions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've seen no evidence that hiring bonuses will do anything to address our retention issues or to actually increase our hiring ability.

        "'speaker_0': 'It's still taking a toll on neighbors. And amending these to eviction defenses will allow tenants who are still struggling to still have at least one last line of defense. So I'll just close by saying that we still need to keep fighting and doing more for low and middle income people here in Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to provide more support to tenants so that a family emergency doesn't lead to eviction and homelessness. We need to build more affordable housing, and we need to invest in social housing in every part of our city so that renters aren't at the whim of a private market.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to invest in our youth so that they're job ready out of high school or college and don't even have to worry about eviction. And we need to invest in protecting workers so they have the security that so many of us have had during this pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to thank the co-sponsor. That's all members. So much for allowing me to co-sponsor. I intend to vote in favor of this bill and I encourage Miami Herald to sign it as soon as possible to ensure that tenants have this one hope to build a better support for them in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q Councilmember Morales, is there any other comments before I handed off to councilmembers to want to close this out? Not too many customers want. I have nothing else to add. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you, Casper Morales, for being the co-sponsor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill? Councilmember Strauss.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Herbold as Councilmember Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Morales. Councilmember mosqueda. I. A. Councilmember Nelson. I. Councilmember Peterson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Swan. Yes. Council President. Chris, I. I'm in favor and unopposed. Thank you, Madam Clerk. The bill passes. The chair will sign it. And metal clerk, please. Affixed my signature to the legislation. So moving on in our agenda to the adoption of other resolutions, I don't see any other resolutions happening today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Other business. Is there any other business to come before council before I move to adjourn? Oh, Caspar Strauss.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President, thank you for running such a well-run meeting today. I will be attending the Association of Washington Cities Annual Forum, and so I am requesting to be excused from full council from council briefing on June 20th and full council on June 21st.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, I'm glad you got that in early. Duly noted. Does anyone have a problem with Council member Strauss being gone June 20th and 21st? I don't accept that these gets to go not be here. But other than.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we are now done with our calendar and let me see what my last party lines are. Oh, I'm sorry. Counselor of Escape. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Counselor Strauss reminded me. I too will be at the board meeting. But I'll just ask for excuse or that's the word. I'll just ask to be excused on June 21st place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the President. I was going to say something, but I didn't want to put you on blast. Isn't Kessler mistaken on that? Thank you. Okay, so we'll note that that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would be the only time you then from now on lasts forever. But oh about I'm president and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Privilege of being an anti yes people note does anyone have a problem with Kessler? I'm scared of being gone on Tuesday, June 21st. Not seeing any both customers get on Kessler Strauss are indeed excused on those days. Okay, let me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's nothing else. Okay, colleagues, this concludes our items of business for today's agenda. Our regularly scheduled next council meeting is Tuesday, May 31st. Oh, yeah, we have a three day holiday, folks, so enjoy. We will not be here on Monday, but we will be here on Tuesday at two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with that, have a good afternoon and we stand adjourned. Thank you.'"
