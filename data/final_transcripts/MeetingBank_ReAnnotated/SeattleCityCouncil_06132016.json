    "Extension of the Living Building Pilot Program Enrollment Period.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'The report of the Planning Land Use and Zoning Committee Agenda Item to cancel 118672 relating to land use and zoning amending section 23.40 point zero 60 of Cielo Mazibuko to extend the enrollment period for the Living Building Pilot Programs Committee recommends the bill pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President Herbold. The Living Building Pilot Program encourages deep green buildings here in the city of Seattle. And we heard a little bit about this during public comment today. Probably the most famous living building in the city is the bullet center on Madison Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city's Deep Green Living Building pilot program allowed a building like that to get some departures from the land use code through a design review. And that was very important because it helps encourage these kinds of buildings that are on the cutting edge, buildings that really reduce their energy usage, water usage, stormwater capture.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are really critically important to meeting our carbon neutrality goals. And the pilot program that we had set up originally here at the city is set to expire at the end of this month. The legislation in front of us would extend that by one year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As we await the Office of Planning and Community Development, who is developing recommendations for a next generation of what the program would look like. So with that, I'll stop and ask if any of my colleagues have any questions, or maybe we'll just get straight to the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will note that the bill came out of committee on a full day passed recommendation three. Oh, maybe I'm just at this point filibustering until we have counted all that goes back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know, maybe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe we should do that. That's probably a good call. So I guess I have a couple comments to make sense for filibustering. I just want to make note that since the establishment of this pilot, only two buildings have been produced so far.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know that in 2015 and I think the spring of 2015, there was a set of recommendations that have come out of the review of this pilot and the Green Building Report and just hoping that the city works to in this next iteration when recommendations are going to be brought forward to the Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe at the end of this year that we can really focus on making sure that the usability of the program is enhanced while not reducing the value of the program to really high standards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wholeheartedly agree.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember O'Brien You know, I'll just add that getting the balance right is tricky, but clearly we've only had two buildings come through. I think there's some work to be done. I know that there's a lot of folks in this community that really strive to build amazingly green buildings, and I look forward to the next.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I appreciate your work to extend this for a year and look forward to the next iteration of actual legislation that will kind of dictate how we can make that work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what we're filibustering. Talk to me a little bit about the bullet building, how that's going, what they've learned, if, you know, in terms of the amount of energy saved or water not used.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't have individual statistics off the top of my head. Councilmember Bagshaw but what I can tell you is that there are some really innovative things that have happened there, not only after the building was constructed, but in its continued operation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They have some very specific energy usage targets that they've set for their individual tenants that allow for tenants to really understand what their energy usage is in the building. It has resulted in several of their tenants decreasing their individual energy usage as one of their tenants is a very active software development company.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They realize they were a huge power user in the building and as a result reconfigured many of their systems to be online through a cloud system and that allowed them to decrease significant their energy usage inside the building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's those kinds of examples that I think are really helping the the bullet center lead the way and not just in terms of the building's construction, but also in its operations. Thank you. Thanks for the question. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now I think we are ready for a vote. Please call the roll and the passage of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bagshaw, Burgess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gonzalez, Johnson O'Brien, Vice President Herbal. Hi. Six in favor and unopposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Please read read items four through eight together through. Oh sorry. Skipping.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fourth rate. No, I am three.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'The changes are found in two recitals, as well as sections one and five are the primary changes. We added a recital that again lifts up the HUD guidance to show that a criminal history screening policy is next must serve a substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory interest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Another recital we included was referencing the the Seattle Fair Chance Employment Ordinance and the way they approach some of these same issues, looking at making sure that individualized assessments and prohibiting questions on initial job applications regarding an applicant's criminal record.'",
