They are getting better and better. And we know that getting people out of the mud is way more important to give them something, a stable place to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as someone mentioned at our committee last week, an individual who is in one of your tiny homes someplace stable is five times more likely to get into permanent housing than if we can't find them, can't give them support, can't get them the services they need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we always underscore that we do not believe the tiny homes are. Those are the ending point. It is a middle point to get people up, get them stabilized, provide them what the help they need and then move forward.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'There will be 3.2 million dedicated for affordable housing. We know once again that this is just a fraction of what we need to really create more affordable housing for people because we've got to be able to have a whole pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as we have been discussing now, not just the last six months, but four years preceding that. Having more housing available in the city, in the county and in our tri county area is what it's going to take.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in the meantime, getting another 500 people off the street is a very welcome opportunity so we can talk more. I was happy to answer questions. I want to specifically say Thanks, Councilmember Mosquito, for coming to the meeting and Councilmember Gonzalez last week.'",

I have now now the chance to go and visit a tiny house village twice in my short tenure on council and really appreciated the leadership and the governance model that was shown and exhibited in my in my time at the camps and'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We must prevent people from falling into homelessness. We must build more affordable housing. We must increase resources for mental health and behavioral health treatment. And in the fiscal note that we have that accompanies this ordinance, the first page reads, The city recognizes that there are not currently enough resources to address the housing needs of everyone who is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'experiencing homelessness and therefore seeks to invest new innovative bridge housing strategies that address the immediate shelter needs of people living unsheltered until permanent housing can be secured. I read this to underscore the importance of not only investing money into short term in terms of shelter and emergency services and hygiene centers, but the ongoing need that's been expressed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by this council and the mayor and the county to find additional resources, because these dollars alone are not going to actually provide the long term housing that folks need to be stable. We need to make sure that we're creating every opportunity for folks to get inside, get off the streets, get out of parks, and to feel safe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and respected and secure in their homes. But we cannot warehouse the homeless for years and we cannot sweep them, the folks who are homeless out of sight just for the short term. What we actually need to do is invest in the long term housing, and I am incredibly supportive of moving this $7.2 million today into the emergency'",

But what we also see here is that there is no money going into outreach, prevention, permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, transit, transitional housing. And when you see zeros in these categories, I think it just underscores the point that so many of us have made'",
        "'speaker_4': 'over the last few months, that we must have long term funding, progressive funding, like the funding that would have been provided from the employee hours tax so that we don't have to think about the heartbreaking reality when the money runs out at the end of this year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want this bridge programs to be successful. I want us to think short term and long term so that we're not actually creating a bridge to nowhere, that we're creating a bridge to housing. So we're creating the bridge today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are investing in the infrastructure that we need to get folks off the street and stable. Let's make sure that there is a bridge that leads to housing. I'm looking forward to ongoing good faith negotiations with the mayor, with the county.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We want those dollars that had been earmarked for the Mariners so that we can actually house folks. We want to think about long term housing solutions so that we can get folks inside and treat this as the emergency that it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that, I think a good chair for her work to highlight the need for us to make sure that people feel respected, that they're safe, that they're in somewhere warm, and that this is a good first step today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But clearly, in order for us to be able to make sure that we're creating a bridge into housing, we must continue to get to work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Catherine Mosquito. Any other further comments before we take a vote? Cast members who want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, President Howell. I intend to vote yes on this ordinance because it's very important for the tiny houses. And I want to thank Sharon Lee and low income housing as you and everybody else who's there who spoke on this issue and who has been working on this for years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's incredibly important the service you are providing on the ground. I also wanted to be clear about what the legislation does and what it does not do. It uses funds from a city owned property sold last year for shelter beds and dining houses for a year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are absolutely essential services because there are thousands of people sleeping unsheltered today with nowhere to go. And it is our social, moral responsibility to do something to help our community members. And and in that sense, it is absolutely critical.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, this legislation does nothing to fund services after that first year, and it does not create the affordable housing that is so desperately needed to get people out of homelessness and to stop the ongoing displacement of working class people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That that is you know, that's really just an ongoing pipeline towards homelessness. People who want homeless do, you know, to start with this year are probably going to be homeless at the end of the year because they're facing such challenges due to skyrocketing rent or also called the attention to councilmembers attention.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The recent study from UCLA, which is a California wide study, but which showed an incredible statistical link between rising rents and rising homelessness. And the only way to fund do to address this problem, first of all, is to to build social housing, which is publicly funded, permanently affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the only way to fund that housing at the scale that we need. As we have discussed many times, is to tax big business and the super wealthy. It is deeply unfortunate that seven of the nine council members here decided to repeal the tax that we had passed on May 14 on Amazon and other big businesses, in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'fact, the 3% largest businesses to fund social housing and essential homeless services. It is really sad that that did not happen. And at the same and I also I want to say that the sweeps of homeless people are ineffective and inhumane and need to stop.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the meantime, we need these emergency services to mitigate the harm of the housing crisis. And for that reason, I will be voting yes on this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilor Swanson. Any other comments? Before we pass the vote. Okay. Well, might have been short. Just. Thank you. Thank you for lending your expertize. And thank you for not only expertize, but making sure that a lot of people in the public want to know how they can help in this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These kinds of efforts allows sort of an opportunity for so many people in this city to chip in, which I think is critically important to us moving the needle. So having said that, I will move to pass Council Bill 119275 as amended.'",

The report from CPD noted the challenges that CPD has in enforcing noise laws that use a decibel standard and require a sound meter which is time consuming, requires calibration and requires officers to carry sound meters.

The 75 foot standard was recommended by the Environmental Health Division of the Department of Public Health, which noted it is, in our opinion, if a sound can be heard clearly and plainly in an in in an outside environment at least 75 feet away, it is of such'",

The maximum permissible level of sounds produced in residential areas is 55 decibels in commercial areas, 57 decibels.'",

I have some comments I'd like to make about that as relates specifically to the 2012 consent decree and the adoption of a new bias free policing policy'",

Thank you very much, Councilmember Herbold, for bringing this forward. As I said before, we know that excessive noise is a public health issue, and thank you for your extensive engagement with communities.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I will be voting no. As I said on this legislation, which I informed Councilmember Herbold office about in advance. And I would like to take a moment to explain why. To be clear, I believe that the people in Seattle should have a right to peace and quiet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I definitely support having laws on the books that will allow people to do something about excessively and unnecessarily loud noises in their neighborhoods and barks. However, this legislation does not make excessively loud vehicles illegal. That is already the case.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Instead, it changes the enforcement from an objective standard measured by decibel into a totally subjective standard that could apply to almost any vehicle in Seattle. The line that is added reads code. Or can be clearly heard by a person of normal hearing at least 75 feet away from the vehicle and quote, 75, 75 feet is actually not'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a very big distance. These council chambers are over 50 feet wide and they are 75 feet wide, if you include the waiting area on the other side of the glass where members of the public come into the chambers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In my staff member Ted Worden measured it. At that distance you would hear most cars. So it all comes down to what it means to see a car can be, quote unquote clearly heard. Clearly is an entirely subjective metric.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think it has to be this legislation should be evaluated in the in in in light of the fact that policing is extremely biased and police officers would choose whom to take it and whom not to take it or cite.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Unfortunately, there is a hoard of statistical evidence that in this country the criminal justice system is used far more frequently and far less leniently to punish people of color and poor people. I hope that if this legislation is passed, its subjectivity would not result in more biased enforcement of noise violations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But statistically speaking, the most likely outcome of this legislation is that more people of color and working class and poor people will be held responsible for driving an old car with a failing muffler. I can easily imagine getting a call from a constituent who relies on their car to get to work and is trying to save up'",
        "'speaker_7': 'money to have that car repaired. But who is falling farther and farther behind because of the tickets they get under this ordinance? I'm sure that many working people have been in situations where they've had a broken muffler and are saving up to fix it again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm extremely sympathetic to everybody who wants to limit noise in their neighborhoods and parks. Peace and quiet is essential for people to relax, and there is nothing unreasonable about that. However, the reality is excessive noise is already illegal and I cannot support making that decision something that is almost entirely subjective.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Finally, I would note that the fiscal note for this ordinance mentions that race and social justice analysis has not yet been done. This seems like an example of a legislation that could really benefit from such an analysis before passage of the legislation, and if there were a motion to send it back to committee to do that work'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not a joke. But somebody has said that one motorcycle driving down at two in the morning after they've left a bar or wherever else they've been, can wake 10,000 people. And I know that on Alki it's become an issue as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've heard it in Ballard around Golden Gardens. And I think the real issue, because we know that motorcycles offer enjoyable and purposeful transportation for many, but as soon as we get the aftermarket modification and those are just designed to increase noise, that it really negatively impacts our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my proposal, God bless you, is to advocate that we look at I'm going to support what you're doing here. I think it's a good first step, but I do think we need to continue to look at what other cities have do have done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Green Bay is an example. Other cities use the EPA, stamp enforcement and an officer can simply look to see if it's a straight pipe and if it has the EPA visible and unalterable stamp on the muffler, then we know that it has passed the EPA standard and that it is a much lower decibel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that is a way that we can go in addresses. What council members want was raising. I do believe that we can continue this. I think yours is a first step in the right direction. I'll be supporting it.'",

This is a good example of you looking at an issue that affected your district, but affects a district, too, in many other districts as well, some more than others because of where some of the modified muffler muffler drivers like to drive.'",

And customer Mesquita, thank you for alerting us to the need for some kind of filter as we look at how this is implemented and customer Gonzalez thank you for hosting the discussion in terms of making our communities more safe, more livable, so good.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'That certainly was a little too short. Thank you, Judy. So as I mentioned at the briefing table this morning, there are two amendments for this bill. This bill is referred to commonly as our omnibus bill, where we make technical corrections to the city's land use code.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So happy to talk about the best legislation, but there are two amendments. I'll talk about them briefly. The First Amendment would change the effective date for the design review program. We had originally received legislation that called for an effective date of October 1st.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The strikes that from the legislation, kids with the current effective date of July 1st, that will be Amendment one amendment to make some technical changes to the downtown office core two zone.

The amendment removed a change brought forth by the department to exempt rowhouse development that's less than 15,000 square feet from design review.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just thought this was an important thing to not include in the omnibus, because the Council had very recently made some changes to design review the previous fall, and this changes more of a policy decision than a technical change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I do not feel it should be part of the omnibus legislation. We wanted to see actually a little bit more experience with the changes that the Council had made last year to the design review process.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'But in particular, I want to focus on this old public school, the Promise program. I'm pleased with this levy that we are expanding the 13th year program to a full fledged promise program.

And we learned that for many of these students, of the 80 students at Ingram, 60% of them, this would be the first time or the first person in their family to attend college'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And over 40% would not even be pursuing college or any kind of trade. But for this program, and that speaks volumes, Northfield College remains a pillar in District five. We have over 18,000 students year around. We have two high schools in D5 and at Northfield College.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have over 800 faculty and also a pre-K program. So you can see that this program has an immense impact in the North End, at least for this district. And I should add that everyone that goes to North Sel College does not live in divide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They live all throughout the city and also come from Shoreline as I'm sorry attend or live in Shoreline as well. But again, the focus is on sale public school students. In any event, North Steel College does incredible work to prepare students for professional careers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'North, south and central are all important resources for all of our students. Education is one of the most cost effective tools we have for ensuring that residents and families in our city will be able to support themselves in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm glad we have such a strong network of colleges to ensure our students are workforce ready. I want to thank particularly again the co-chairs in working with me in restoring the K-5 funding. I thought that that was very critical.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that. I know that a lot of the decisions we made weren't easy ones, but I'm always proud when we come to some consensus. I'm also pleased to learn that the sale college. This will be contributing toward the Sale Promise program, ensuring that it remains at a high level.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A higher level proposed by the mayor so that more students can participate. I'd also like to acknowledge the work of this Council to increase funding, like I said, such as the summer learning that benefits the K-12 students. The schools in my district work hard to provide a great educational experience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Gonzalez mentioned the Bobby Eagle Staff School, which they believe is K to eight, and it's a brand new school.

Sweetie, when we're ensuring kids can keep up their learning, not only with the pre-K issues, but also over the summer months, and that'",

We know that the quality preschool, getting our children ready to go into kindergarten has made a big difference to close the opportunity gap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to acknowledge our former colleague, Tim Burgess, that was something that he started working on, I think, around 2010. And he pushed for the real data based work, knowing that when kids are ready for school and get into kindergarten and have that sense of pride and respect and confidence that they then can move on into'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks. So there's a lot of work that has gone into getting us to today. And I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about how much I've learned as part of this process and why I'm excited to have this levy in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, when Councilmember Gonzalez and I started on this pathway, you know, a little more than six months ago, we started having a round of community conversations. And those community conversations asked us to really weave. Together critical investments throughout the spectrum from birth to 20 and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But for us, fortunately, we were standing on the shoulders of a set of investments that is made in partnership with the school district going all the way back to Mayor Norm Rice in 1990. So for those who may think that this is a little out of the blue because you may have been focused on other conversations that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'have been happening at City Hall, this is a set of investments that we have been making to support kids in our public schools for now, almost three decades. And for me, I think that I'm sorry. More than three decades.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For me, this opportunity to have a fifth measure back in front of voters is really critical to the success of kids in our schools, because it supports those kids in a way that the school district doesn't necessarily allow for right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The first of which is it expands our pre-K program. And time and time again, we've shown that investing in high quality preschool is one of the best investments that a city can make. And we also continue the legacy investments that the current program has made and rigorous evaluation and teacher support to make sure that the kids in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'those pre-K programs are getting the best education that we can possibly provide. Secondly, we take the investments that we make in our K through 12 space, and we rebalance those in a way that allows for our elementary school kids to sustain the gain that they get from that preschool investment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'By continuing the education and investment in 21 elementary schools that are currently getting the city's innovation funds, the four middle schools that are currently getting those same innovation funds and five high schools will expand from just innovation funds in the ninth year all the way to the 12th year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we really grow the investments in K-12, particularly with a focus on high school. We also are growing the support that were given to those students, whether those students are experiencing homelessness or whether those students need to come to a nurse or health care center or need additional family support.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city is step up in all three of those places in ways that allow for us to continue partnerships in the school district that don't exist. Right now, we're going from 25 health care clinics to 29. We're investing in 15 full time family support workers, which is about half of the family support workers that would be needed'",
        "'speaker_8': 'if we had family support workers in all of our Title one schools. We're investing another $13 million in our opportunity and access funds, which will allow schools to competitively apply for programs that they think will help close the opportunity gap within their schools.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that's another way we can continue to allow for innovation to come to schools and allow principals and educators to come to the city with an innovative and interesting idea that they think will make a difference for their schools blessing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And finally, that promise program that folks have talked about, I think is a pathway for those 550 or some odd students that we anticipate will graduate from SPS high schools and give them a chance to have a leg up so that they can start on a pathway that will make them competitive for those next generation jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So for me, as a parent of two in public schools who in September will have three in public schools, I'm really excited about the work that we have done to put us on a foundation which I hope will continue to build off of the legacy of almost 35 years of investments that previous councils and previous administrations have'",
        "'speaker_8': 'meant we wouldn't be here without a whole lot of support. Councilmember Bagshaw mentioned several members of the school board who've been critical in helping us get to this point. I want to recognize Dr. Pan and your leadership with the Seattle colleges who've been excellent partners throughout this whole process.'",

We know that investing in our youth ensures that we have a resilient economy. We have included components in this levy that promote equity by closing the opportunity gap.'",

Part of the excitement that I have today comes from the investment that we're putting into child care for our kiddos, really in 0 to 3, expanding'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So we want to create the opportunity for families to make that decision on their own. We also know that many of the childcare providers are women, many are people of color, many are immigrants. And we want to make sure that we're investing in high quality training programs and providing those child care providers with the mentorship and the'",

We also want to make sure that we are creating a mentorship program that means that people don't get burnt out in this industry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's incredibly difficult sometimes and that they have the tools and the resources they need to be successful. And so I'm excited about this opportunity. I want to thank again the co-chairs. I want to thank their incredible staff, Jerry and V and my staff for her work on this effort as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Brian and Allie provided a significant amount of background for me on how we could make sure that a mentorship and training program, opportunities for enhanced learning for professionals who want to be childcare providers were included. And so I want to thank them for their endless efforts to address questions that I had.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also I just want to say how great it is that we have a Seattle Promise program that not only looks at opportunities for two year and potential four year opportunities, but looks at nontraditional learning through apprenticeship opportunities, through working with the building and construction union trades to make sure that we are getting more people into highly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'skilled, well-paid opportunities in post-high school apprenticeship programs. This is a huge, huge day and I'm excited to be proud of it. And I know that you've been working on this for years. Co-Chairs, so thank you for your work to make sure that this is possible.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Fresno. I will be supporting this education levy because it provides essential funds, especially in the context of the state legislature having for years criminally underfunded our statewide public education system. I do also want to be clear, though, that this it is disappointing, though not surprising, that in the midst of a very public discussion on progressive'",
        "'speaker_7': 'versus regressive taxes, the mayor has proposed education funding that still continues to depend on property taxes, which are becoming harder and harder for working class and middle class homeowners to afford, rather than using taxes on big business, which would have begun a much needed reversal of the regressive tax system of Seattle and the region.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is worth contrasting the generosity and social involvement of regular working people who vote to renew this and other important levies year after year, to the Dickensian response of Amazon and other big companies, to paying even a minuscule tax that would have amounted to just pocket change for them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In fact, the Amazon tax, which would have been on companies like Amazon, Starbucks, Nordstrom's, Facebook and so on, the largest group, 3% of the corporations was going to be half the size per year of this education levy. And yet these big businesses fought ferociously against it rather than supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So despite my disappointment over the source of funding in this levy, I want to be completely clear. We need to support this levy because our schools have nowhere near the resources that they need, and our young people and our educators deserve better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. KATZ First, want a swinging hands? Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just wanted to echo the thanks from my colleagues on the council to all of the folks who have participated in the process. I think we had a number of different, really important objectives that we wanted to try to juggle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We wanted to see increased enrollment in pre-K, and we wanted to move into.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A new area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of support with the Seattle Promise program. And I think while we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Reduced the growth that was originally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Proposed in the mayor's proposal, we still see significant growth in the pre-K program. We have somewhat reduced funding in the Seattle Promise program, and our ability to do so again, thanks goes to Seattle College. Seattle colleges agreeing to help work with private donors and advocates to help us make sure that we make a conscious decision that tuition'",
        "'speaker_3': 'subsidies from public dollars are prioritizing historically underserved students and those most in need of financial support. The combination of those tweaks in the mayor's proposal has allowed us to maintain funding for for K through five, which I think is incredibly important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a it's really, as we are realizing gains in in pre-K and getting folks getting our youth ready for for for college. It's really important that we maintain support through the the K through five years. And I'm also really pleased I think we'll talk about this a little bit more when we get into the resolution discussion, but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really pleased about some of the particular investments in in K through five that we're able to maintain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. What I thought may make sense is for us to vote on the accounts bill first, then the resolution, although it's been read into the record since it takes seven votes and then comes from O'Brien's resolution to be articulated that that's what makes sense for everyone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I'm ready to go with that. So but I would like to comment on that. On the base legislation, which you could do on the resolution, part two could do it, too. I'll wait. Okay, let's let's vote on the council bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we got a little more dialog on the resolution. And Councilmember O'Brien is going to say a few things. Okay. Okay. So please call the roll on the passage of council bill 119258.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whereas Macheda I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'O'BRIEN All right, so on back to Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I herbold i.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Johnson President Harrell nine in favor and unopposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bill passed and the chair was silent and we should have a resolution. Councilmember Bryan, later through which I'd like to talk about either on the Bass legislation or the resolution. Yeah. So they both really briefly. First, I really want to thank all the hard work again that has gone into both the legislation which we just passed and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the resolution, particularly my colleagues, council members Johnson and Gonzales, for leading us through this process and folks in central staff who've been doing a lot of work, really. And I applaud all the folks in the community who do this work day in, day out over the years and bring their expertize to the table to help us balance'",
        "'speaker_0': 'so many important needs. And my colleagues have mentioned in a way that I can be really proud of for the city of Seattle to support and hopefully see support going forward. So thank you for all of that. I also really appreciate the work on the resolution specifically to help outline what's going how we will move forward on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this. I appreciate my colleagues willingness to put language in there that supports some of the recommendations and considerations I've had during this process. I do have an amendment that I'd like to propose today. It's simply inserting one additional sentence for, I believe, for clarity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this would be an amendment to Section three of the resolution under Part A, which is titled Parent Child Home Program. The resolution currently reads in the first sentence, provide full funding for the parent child home program with sweetened beverage tax proceeds or other general fund resources in future proposed budgets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My amendment would insert a sentence that then reads in determining funding availability from sweetened beverage tax proceeds. Council expects the executive to follow the guidance of the Sweetened Beverage Tax Community Advisory Board. And then the last sentence, as written in the resolution, says If the sweetened beverage tax or other general fund resources are insufficient to support the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'parent child home program, the executive chef shift funding priorities and propose amendments to the A-fib plan to ensure that PCH is fully funded. So I will move that amendment, which I'll call amendment number one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Secondly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved in. Second Amendment number one, as described by council member Brian has been moved. And second, any further comments on the amendment only? All those in favor of the amendment. Please vote I. I oppose. The ayes have it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that was just. The amendment comes from Brown. And you like to talk a little bit more about the resolution? I'm good. You're good. Any other comments? Councilmember Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just briefly, I want to say a couple of quick things. You know, there are various levels of specificity to the work that we do here, particularly as it relates to measures that we put in front of the voters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so the ordinance that we adopted just a minute ago is basically the authorization that allows us to go out to the voters and ask them to raise their property taxes, to pay for families, education, preschool and promise.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This resolution outlines a lot more detail and specificity. So for those who are interested in peeking behind the curtain, a little bit more about how the council intends for us to spend this money should the voters adopted the resolution as a great place for you to look, I want to call out a couple of things specifically that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'are called out in the resolution here, one of which is that we expect 54% of the levies funds to go for the preschool components of the plan, and that 54% of funding will support approximately 2500 students per year as we get to the end of the levy cycle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So an incredibly important investment that we're making. Secondarily with with the preschool program, we also ask the Department of Education or Early Learning to do some additional work around some things that we had heard from the public outreach process for critically important to preschool providers, including things like a unified application process across subsidized tuition model, coordination with'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the state interested in a length of the day. We currently fund a six hour day. Can we go to a ten hour day? There are some really good ideas that were generated during the course of public comment. Those are outlined in the resolution for the Department of Early Learning to continue to continue to do, work on and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'report back to us. There was a question that came up earlier from our friends from the Seattle Education Association about what kind of investments are we really making in the K through five space. We clearly call out in the resolution a $56 million investment in the K five space to put at ease those who may be concerned'",
        "'speaker_8': 'about whether or not there's a deal here about the investments annually at $8 million a year that is very clearly identified as are additional dollars associated with opportunity and access funds. The Seattle Promise Program and several others have layers of specificity related to health and homelessness funding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It should also be pointed out, Councilmember Bagshaw, that very clearly does the resolution ask for $1.4 million to be spent on a school based health center at Noble High School? So the resolution has a second level of specificity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then we intend, should the voters be successful in adopting this, to get an implementation plan from the Department of Education and Early Learning, that will give us an even higher level of specificity other than what's outlined in the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But for those folks who are looking to dig into some more details, the resolution is a great place to do it. I'm thankful to the deal, folks, the mayor's office advocates and our central staff and our staffs for getting us to this place, because I think that this is the level of detail that many of my colleagues'",
        "'speaker_8': 'were looking for in the ordinance, in the resolution. This is the place where it's landed. So thanks to everybody for giving me a couple of minutes to talk about that, because I think it's critically important for success.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Johnson. I'll see some brief remarks and then perhaps Councilman Gonzalez could say a few remarks. Then we can vote that council Councilmember Dwayne Chappelle, thank you and your team deal. You've been awesome. We have a phenomenal opportunity in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's precisely that, an opportunity people will ask for the next several months. Can we afford it? In. My response will be we. We can't afford not to pass this levy, that the future of our kids, the future of our city largely depends on addressing the opportunity gap, addressing the opportunity disparities, addressing the education for all of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our kids, even the ones that are doing extremely well and those that are doing poorly that we have to design an ecosystem through this kind of investment to. To educate the types of employees and leaders and workers and the types of people that can make this city great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is a great opportunity. A comedian once said a quote, If opportunity doesn't knock than build a door. And I always think of that, that what we're doing is we're building a great opportunity for this city. What I'm most excited, I think about is when we look at the work we did during the preschool phase, when'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we looked at the brain development of children and how the disparities occur. Something that a lot of people don't think about, particularly where they're in their fourth or fifth grade, about what either occurred or did not occur during those formative years, you know, zero, three, three, three and four year olds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we started looking at in K through 12 where kids just get off track, whether it's during the summer because they're hungry. And we look at those interventions that you all are so well versed in. But what I think is equally bold about this, and when my daughter was at Madrona Middle School and graduated from Cleveland'",
        "'speaker_0': 'High School, it became so apparent that so many kids right now, right when they're getting ready to graduate, just don't have a clue as to what they're going to do. Unfortunately, they don't have the three eight GPAs. Many of these kids are, you know, to six to 7 to 8 GPAs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and to see the light in their eyes when they say, I'm going to college through this program. The energy, the synergy. It's amazing. And I've sat in classrooms with these kids, have been on campus and talk with these kids.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Many of these kids have testified in front of us. And so this is bold. This is the opportunity, I think, that warrants the word promise in this letter with the promise we're making to our kids. And so, Councilmembers Johnson and Gonzales, you did the hard work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You listen, you gather an information, provided data, you work with deal. The advocates did their job. And we have come up with a phenomenal package. And like I said earlier, we can't afford not to get this levy passed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm very excited about supporting it. Councilmember Gonzales, you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President, those are really on point remarks. I really appreciate you and your leadership as council president for the council as well. And I know that you were the prior chair of education, so I know you've had a lot of involvement in this, and we're a little leader in establishing funding for Seattle Promise in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'first place. So I'm really excited to have your continued support in this area and your what I'm hearing is an endorsement of the package. So thank you. I have some final remarks that I wrote up that I want to share with folks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In 1964, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr accepted a Nobel Peace Prize, and in his speech over 50 years ago, he said, quote, I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture, for their minds and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Close quote today. Those words are solidly in my mind, and it is exactly that sentiment described in that quote in those words that it is that I fundamentally believe it is critical for the city of Seattle to reaffirm its commitment to the ideals encapsulated and described in that quote By continuing to invest in our children from birth'",
        "'speaker_3': 'through college, we know that the opportunity and kindergarten readiness gap affects all students, but especially students of color, low income students, English language learners, students with learning disabilities, and students experiencing homelessness. The persistence of these gaps tell us the equitable access to education and supports to achieve academically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Academically continues to be the civil rights struggle of our time. And while the Seattle Public School District holds the paramount duty to provide basic education to Seattle's children, we know that their ability to fulfill that duty is interconnected with the investments that the City of Seattle makes through our prior and expiring families and education and preschool levees'",
        "'speaker_3': '. The City of Seattle and its residents play an important role in supporting our public school system success in their efforts to help each child fulfill their potential. We do this in several ways through this levy that will literally transform the trajectory of the children living in our city forever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When children show up to kindergarten, they'll be ready to learn. Thanks to our investments in early learning and expansion of our quality preschool program, quality preschool programing plus wraparound services are where the education pipeline begins for our children and their families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Participation in quality public preschool positively impacts a child's school experiences by reducing the demand for grade repetition, special education placement, mental health services, judicial system involvement and unemployment support in the future. We also know that the number of children experiencing homelessness has drastically grown since the passage of the 2011 Families and Education Levy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We now have an opportunity through this levy to ensure that students experiencing homelessness are not left out of our education system. Through this renewed levy package and its associated investments, we also increase our investments in student health centers that are public schools.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A historic area of investments. Since the 1990, Families and Education Levy first passed. Research finds that poor health severely limits a child's motivation and ability to learn, and that school based health centers improve student health and emotional well-being.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This, in turn, AIDS academic performance by increasing attendance rates and a student's grade point average over time. Likewise, a student is 21 times more likely to access mental health services at a school based health center if it's available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are important, historic and new investments in the K-through-12 space that do not qualify for McCleary funding. And that will end if this levy does not pass this November. We round out our education spectrum investments by investing in a student's opportunity to attend college to obtain a degree or certificate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is an area that the city currently funds in partnership with the Seattle Colleges via our general fund. This proposal that we just passed shifts those investments to the levy to provide a sustainable. Will revenue stream over the next seven years to continue investing in those kids, graduating from our public high schools, graduating from high school and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'completing a post-secondary training improves a person's earning potential and economic self-sufficiency. And recent studies have told us that two thirds of the jobs projected to come to Seattle in the next seven years will require a post-secondary degree or certificate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have before us a unique opportunity for Seattle taxpayers to provide tuition and supports to bridge students into living wage jobs of the 21st century. And lastly, I would just like to say thanks to all of my colleagues on the dais here today who were willing to dig in to the work and and be ready to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'vote today. And one time in particular, I think Councilmember Rob Johnson from District four, sitting over here to my right for being such an amazing partner in developing this proposal and just really staying true and committed to what our principles and goals were in terms of making sure that the full spectrum of education was going to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'invested in here and in truly, your knowledge and commitment as a parent was just instrumental in in my own learning in terms of what it means to operate within the Seattle Public Schools system. Since I went to a public school in central Washington and really just appreciate all of your insight to making sure that the priorities in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this package were reflective of student needs, parent needs, educator needs, school district needs, the whole the whole gamut. So thank you so much for being an awesome partner and colleague in getting this to this point. And then I also want to thank Mayor Durkan for our ongoing commitment to continued investments in this particular area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know she's done had to do a tremendous amount of work in her first six months of her administration. And to get us here and I really appreciate her willingness to make sure that our individual priorities were able to be reflected in this final package that will be considered by the voters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, of course, a huge thanks to folks over the Department of Education and Early Learning. Duane Veronica, monica said, So many of you have put in countless hours over the last year and a half to develop a package that is reflective of the countless hours of community engagement that I know all of you did, and to lend'",

So I really want to thank you for all of that, but more importantly, I want to thank you all the entire team over at Deal, including'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those that are not sitting in the audience. And there's probably like, I don't know, 20 people back in the office right now. There's a lot of you here, but I really want to thank all of deal for your steadfast commitment to our kids and to our families and and to the educators along the spectrum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are and we are very lucky to have you all be with us and to be as dedicated as you are to achieving equity in this space. So thank you so much. And then lastly, I want to thank all of the staff, Gerry and V for my office and Brian Goodnight and Ali Pankey and so many others'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for all that you did to make sure that we are prepared and that all of my council colleagues were prepared. So I've just been truly honored and humbled to work on this lovely proposal. And I hope that the voters will agree that this is a investment that is worth not just worth making, but that it's an investment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is honestly the single most important thing we can do as members of our community is to invest in the future of our city, which.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is our kids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
