I do have it available and in front of me. One of the questions raised by Councilmember Morales had been How many agreements do we have that offer reserved access for private entity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'entities in exchange for some level of investment in the parks?

        "'speaker_1': 'Club. So five total arrangements across Seattle Parks and Recreation that have this kind of contract. But the and I won't go into the rest of the details. But if colleagues want to review, Parks did provide a significant amount of detail on all of those agreements and additions that they can review for the level of investment and public'",

The next question from Councilmember Morales was What analysis has been done on Seattle Park facilities to assess local neighborhood access for private school access? And Seattle Parks indicated they're currently conducting outreach to assess what each of the local neighborhoods desire for park play fields.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is also sort of been a component of the Metropolitan Park District outreach that we're familiar from from that process. They track play field use through our use reports for known play field users. And very high utilizers of playing fields include public schools, private schools, youth organizations, adult rec leagues, Seattle Park, parks and Recreation, official recreation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'programs, and of course, just individual groups for private events. Seattle Public Schools have first priority scheduling rights through the Joint Use Agreement for all Seattle parks, which is a point that they that they note. But that is that excludes the facilities where there is a unique arrangement with a private partner.'",

The final question, two questions from Councilmember Morales that were answered. How is the public benefit in this particular at the Montlake agreement calculated, and how are we measuring their success in providing a public benefit?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Parks responded that in the original agreement, Seattle Craft was not required to provide an explicit public benefit component. And the new proposal does enumerate, as I've indicated, a requirement of 50 additional public programing hours, which is a new component of the contract, and that is going to be tracked and recorded as part of the agreement upon'",
        "'speaker_1': 'entering into an agreement. This is the final question, Councilmember. I was asked upon entering into an agreement. What is the how do we essentially assess the the and understand the equitable benefit to the community? So so touching on the equity of these arrangements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. This is broken into several sub questions. The first one is the community outreach to communities of color to receive scholarships and participate in sporting programs at the site. Parks responded that per the agreement, Seattle Prep will be reaching out to community centers around the city, as well as schools in less advantaged areas with specific offers to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'participate in this supplemental programing. Generally, registrations run through their website for on campus middle school camps, which is one of the things Seattle Prep is offering. Registration for lacrosse, speed and agility camps run offline to eliminate the barriers to entry or in-person recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All fees for those camps will be waived for low income and disadvantaged youth. These camps are meant to serve as an opportunity to introduce new groups, new sports and spread fitness to underserved communities. The other subquestion in that category what are the statistics regarding applications and number of scholarships and participation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These public benefits will be tracked through an annual report, and the report requires Gallup to track participation numbers, hours of service provided volunteers, hours, number of programs provided, and the costs associated with all the public benefits. So there are articulable metrics in the agreement that are going to be tracked and reported on back to the Council as'",

So Parks doesn't anticipate compliance to be an issue. Seattle Prep run programs and events through the public benefit requirement will be free to the community, so there is no expectation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of Seattle Prep charging for those services. And then the final subquestion was what in the past experience and methods of Seattle Prep in reaching out to youth within within those communities. So what is the track record of Seattle Prep as a partner in doing this work?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the past experiences have been in conjunction with the Montlake Community Center, the Seattle Nativity School, Northwest Child and other nonprofit groups that that are local to the Seattle Prep neighborhood. Seattle Prep has partnered with the Montlake Community Center in the past to provide student led tutoring services for children of low income and marginalized backgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Taylor Prep has worked with Northwest Child to facilitate programs dedicated to supporting people with disabilities with recreational opportunities. So that is the summary of Seattle Parks responses. Again, councilmembers can review that memo that was provided last Friday. And the the attachment of the public benefits template and matrix that is attached to the legislation is a good reference'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We did insert and make sure that Parks is has a robust race and social justice piece, that the public benefits piece is outweighs the private use of public benefits, that we track the progress and the success and the benefits in the use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And more importantly, as you shared, Councilmember Lewis, that we look at outreach not only to the communities but working with community centers in any other public asset that the private entity is using the public space for. So thank you for that.'",
