We can change that by providing direct assistance to thousands, thousands of undocumented families, thousands of the small businesses, owners and workers right here in our city.

I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for his feedback on this legislation, along with a handful of other council members who've been asking about how do we address creating certain conditions that would be appropriate for nonprofit health care entities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I mentioned this morning, Councilmember Peterson, thank you for your feedback as we thought about nonprofit entities in the health care sector. Appreciate your the ongoing conversations we've had there. You know, at the onset, I want to say I'm concerned about any exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The amendment in front of us, however, is carefully crafted to respond to some of the issues that we've heard, for example, from DHS, the International Community Health Services. Today, the person who called in was expressing the unanticipated consequences or cost specific issues, specifically due to COVID that are affecting certain sectors of the nonprofit health care sector.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we wanted to carefully respond to those concerns that were brought up. The legislation in front of us was carefully crafted based on some feedback. I want to thank folks that SEIU Health Care 1199 Northwest folks from Kaiser, from Fred Hutch and from Seattle Children's for their feedback as we tried to think about a carefully crafted amendment'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And also again note that while nonprofit hospitals generally are considered charities by the Internal Revenue Service, many nonprofit hospital systems have in all revenues in the billions, with chief operators earning seven or eight figure salaries. And in many ways their peers are large corporations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the proposal in front of you attempts to find an equitable solution to rebuilding our economy in a way that does not further subsidize profit driven health care providers and prioritize community needs. Instead, with the amendment in front of you suggest that Seattle's economic recovery plan is built around jump start.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should address nonprofit health care providers accordingly and make sure that certain organizations continue to provide resources and make sure that there are contributions coming in. This amendment in front of us contemplates payments, building needs on salaries over 400,000.'",

And as we've seen recently, too, it does look like, as we discussed this morning, we are in for a very long fight still on COVID'",

And we know that we're going to need to make sure that those nonprofit partners stay strong, that they can stay in the fight, and that we continue to be good partners with them in helping them confront this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this amendment was a long way towards doing that. I look forward to voting in favor of it. And similarly, want to thank our partners at SEIU 1199 and our partners at the nonprofits themselves, at Kaiser Permanente, at Children's, at Fred Hutchison four for their work in helping make sure we can shape something that is responsive'",

        "'speaker_1': 'over the past months, such as a nonprofit, affordable housing operator, shelters, food delivery, childcare providers and more.

        "'speaker_1': 'providers acting, asking to be exempted despite the extraordinary expense that they have been incurring and despite the expectation that they will continue to meet a heightened need for the rest of this year and into next. So I'm just really concerned that we are basically saying one kind of work, one kind of nonprofit work, it should be exempt'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And the broader nonprofit provider community has not made the argument that they should be exempt. And and I think there's an equity impact of this amendment. We know that larger nonprofits, health care, nonprofits in particular, including hospitals and research institutions, are more likely to be led by white people and men, while small smaller organizations, including many service'",
        "'speaker_1': 'providers, are more likely to be led by women and people of color. I'm concerned that the effect of this amendment would just unfortunately impact the organizations that are led by women and people of color. While organizations more likely to be white and male, that would their their organizations would receive an exemption.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And my my question about the amendment itself relates specifically to clause C in the definition of a nonprofit health care entity. And central staff has declined to to answer questions about this particular section and has encouraged us to direct questions back to to the sponsor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And specifically, the question is, is what is a predominantly. Capitated provider. Provider group. Capitated. Capitated provider. Group. I'm just trying to get a sense of what type of organization is meant to be targeted or by this language because as I understand, C would broaden the exemption to a type of provider that I'm not quite understanding the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The description of that type of a provider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Which one of the sponsors would like to take that one up?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would defer to Councilmember Lewis. Councilmember, would you like to take this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So Councilmember Herbold, that's a good question. And in particular, to section C of the exemption, that is a rather odd phrase. And I'm saying that as a lawyer who would not encountered that particular phrase. And so kind of working with stakeholders on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My understanding is the only provider in King County that that particular phrase would apply to is Kaiser Permanente based on their kind of group health, their cooperative HMO status. That is like more unique and more it's a more unique and surgical term for the unique area that Kaiser Permanente falls into as a cooperative provider.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that language was worked on in consultation with SEIU 1199 and other stakeholders who verified that that indeed is is the provider that would be included based on that language.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I think the council president just wanted to provide some additional context for this amendment. As I understand it, there was a discussion about exempting nonprofits last week, and then there was a discussion about health care providers during COVID.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just for I believe this amendment, correct me if I'm wrong, Councilor Mosquito, but I believe this amendment is just for the initial three years and the sunset clause has been removed from the from the, the overall ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this will be really focused on those providing health care during COVID. I think it includes Seattle Children's, it includes the Hutch, includes Cancer Care Alliance. I think would be exempt from this or this exemption would would help those organizations.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you, Madam President. So I do think that it is still important to at least have a discussion today about the reinstitution of some kind of sunset clause to reaffirm the commitment of this Council to eventually transitioning to regional revenue options as an alternative to maintaining our own payroll tax in perpetuity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did not particularly care for a ten year sunset clause. I thought that was too soon. I thought that it also could put in jeopardy some of the investments that we are proposing to make under this legislation that will probably entail and require accumulation over a longer period of time and possibly entering into certain bonding or capital'",
        "'speaker_3': 'commitments. So this proposal would create a 20 year sunset clause. The hope would be that in that time we would be able to transition as a state in a region to some regional alternative tax. I have full faith and confidence in the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seattle City Council 20 years from now to re extend, renew or expand on this tax in the event that such regional sources of revenue do not exist at that time. I think that that timeline acknowledges and you know, I mean, we had we had Tim Heineman call in and comment earlier to comment on this legislation, you know'",
        "'speaker_3': ', making it clear that there are a lot of folks in the state that are still opposed to a conversation around progressive revenue. So I understand that is a heavy lift to get that out of Olympia. But my hope is that on a 20 year timeline, that's more realistic than a ten year one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It won't put in jeopardy the investments that we are making now, nor undercut the urgency of this proposal. And so I would move that we institute this compromise sunset as enumerated out in the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any questions or comments on a proposed amendment to. Councilmember Sawant, you are recognized.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I oppose this amendment because this amendment attempts to bring back a sunset clause, even though the city council's budget committee on Wednesday voted for my amendment to eliminate the sunset clause. 20 years may sound like a long time to politicians who are not doing the hard work of building grassroots movements, giving their blood, sweat and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tears to build for social justice. 20 years may sound like a long time for people who are not struggling to get by, but for any of us who have been on the grassroots fighting and I don't just mean our generations, I'm talking about people in Seattle who have fought for decades for bringing about an end to regressive'",
        "'speaker_4': 'taxation. I think they will know that these are hollow words that, you know, that of our Councilmember Lewis to say that 20 years from now, I hope something will be done regionally. Why? Because something was done in the last 20 years and in the 20 years before that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that what your hope is based on the fact that nothing was done by regional and state political officials at the same time, that they gave handout after handout to big corporations and executives like Boeing executives? This is extremely problematic and furthermore, completely tone deaf.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To bring this amendment at the last second when the public can't speak out against this particular amendment. But, you know but the public has spoken the movement has spoken very clearly against any kind of sunset clause. And it's particularly egregious that this amendment will if this amendment goes through, it would make sure that the tax is automatically'",
        "'speaker_4': 'repealed, not that there would be any conditions placed on it, even, which would somewhat mitigate. I would I would never support a sunset tax period on progressive revenues, but there is no mitigating aspect about this amendment at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as far as what needs to be sunsetted, why not those sales taxes that are so burdensome to working class people, and particularly heat hit black and brown communities and immigrant communities of color? Why not the property taxes that make it difficult for working class and middle class homeowners to keep their homes?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why not a sunset clause on taxes, on struggling small businesses? I just am really stunned that despite all the rhetoric that we have heard, that the sunset clause is back again and that the sunset clause is only being proposed to one of the only taxes that working people do not have to pay, that small businesses do not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have to pay. The fact that politicians will go to such lengths to undemocratically sneak through a sunset clause shows which side they are really on. Clearly, the council is going to vote yes on the Amazon tax today because our movement has gathered 30,000 signatures to put this on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that represents a real a real threat, not an imaginary or abstract, but a real threat to big business. And that is why this is going through. And the establishment knows that they have no other choice but the fact that this amendment is being brought forward for a sunset clause.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It shows what that shows the lengths to which the establishment politicians will go through. I absolutely pledge that if this amendment passes, then we will, in our movement, do everything in our power to make sure that we fight against the establishment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I will also say that putting this this kind of sunset clause in such a progressive law as the rare progressive laws that we are able to win, that basically is saying that, you know, you hardworking people, you thousands who who spend all your weekends and all your waking hours aside from your work and your family to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'build this movement, you're going to have to do it in another 20 years. Another generation will have to come and fight the same battles over and over again. And I think this also illustrates why this system ultimately cannot be reformed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we need substantive, fundamental change to our society.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Swann. Any other comments? I see Councilmember Herbold and colleagues. If anyone else has any comments, please feel free to indicate Councilmember Strauss have you in the queue. Councilmember Herbold, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So I just want to say that although I recognized in past meetings that there was an importance for a sunset clause and its potential to bring useful pressure to bear on other jurisdictions as a as a as a way to encourage legislators and state and business stakeholders to work towards progressive revenue, specifically a regional progressive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'revenue source. I really feel like last week in committee we we settled this issue because we amended the tax legislation with language that is much clearer about council's intent to repeal this tax that the new progressive regional or state taxes enacted that would provide a similar level of funding to Seattle as we do under this bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So again, I felt like we sort of resolved this this issue in our in our committee meeting. The amendment we passed in committee, I think, better addresses and settles the circumstances under which the council would support ending this specific tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't believe that a 20 year sunset clause provides any additional pressure that is not already better addressed through the amendment passed last week in committee. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'John.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for those comments. Councilmember Strauss, the floor is yours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President. Thank you. Council Member Lewis for bringing this amendment forward. Last week I did vote for a sunset clause due to my hesitance regarding the level playing field language. I did think that ten years was too much too short, because in particular, there are aspects of this bill that are tied to 20 year funding'",
        "'speaker_3': 'segments, especially regarding permanent supportive housing. I do believe that a future council will benefit from evaluating this tax in 20 years to understand if it needs to be raised, lowered or otherwise adjusted to fit the times. I'm supporting a 20 year sunset rather than the ten year sunset because the 20 year sunset is associated with the spending'",
        "'speaker_3': 'plan that we will be that we've already discussed and will be voting on. While jump start Seattle is different than property tax and sales tax levies which are put to the ballot, they also have renewals which are sunset clauses under a different name.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there are sunset clauses in these sales tax and property tax levies that are put forward to voters. And while these taxes, the Jumpstart proposal is different than the levy, we have mirrored the process for Jumpstart Seattle in creating rates and services rendered to our city and our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So and that has been a 20 year segment. So I think if nothing else, in 20 years we will need to reassess the rates and create a new spending plan to be associated with the proposal. And sunset could just be as easily worded as a renewal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This amendment fits into the narrowly tailored nature of this bill, and I appreciate the work being put forward on this. Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Strauss. Any other comments or questions on the bill? Excuse me, on the agenda item president.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I may.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Councilmember Suarez, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Just briefly, I will be supporting this. And, you know, I don't really want to get into a tit for tat about whose side I'm on trying to approach this with common sense. And I agree with Councilmember Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my understanding is if we have a 20 year sunset further out of funds, that is the less volatile it is, which gives us a 20 year window, if you will, to plan. And hopefully within 20 years when I'm 80, this state will have progressive taxes in place, not only on income, but certainly hopefully on the tax'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that the city will probably pass today. So with that, I'll be supporting it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Suarez perhaps the only tit for tat that i'll get into is to say that I will only be 63 years old in 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome. Any time. Councilmember Mosquito, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Colleagues, I had a lot of concerns with the initial ten year proposals that I did included in our draft bill because of some of the feedback that we received from people who were working on legislation as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the points that have been made with concerns are very well taken. I have been clear that in my main concern with the ten year sunset as it was proposed, was that it could potentially unintentionally limit our ability to do permanent supportive housing, which requires, in many cases a 20 year funding commitment because this is at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'least 20 years, and it will, I hope, be considered a renewal, but more importantly, that there will be more the level action that is taken and get us to a more equitable tax proposal. I'll support a 20 year, but that is, I think, the minimum, given that this is needed funding for from the point of housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate that it is that length of time. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, councilmember mosqueda. Any other questions or comments on this proposed amendment? Councilmember Swartz's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I just wanted to clarify something. Clarify on something that Strauss just said and just paraphrasing what he said. He said that he supports this sunset clause because he wants a future council to reconsider this tax to see if it should be raised, lowered or kept the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That sounds very reasonable, but let's be clear. The amendment does not say raised or lowered or kept the same. It just says, quote, No business shall or a payroll expense tax for payroll expenses after December 31st, 2040. Unquote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is a straight up removing of the tax in 20 years, and all the faith is going to be put on that future council as if there's so much evidence that councils will do the right things. I just want to make make clear that what was said was not something that's in the amendment, actually.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. So what I see, Councilmember Strauss's hand has gone up. So, Councilmember Strauss, you are recognized. Are there any colleagues again? Anyone else who wants to speak? Please let me know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Council President and thank you, Councilmember Swan. I appreciate your comments there. I would say that that is the same language that is used in the Seattle Transportation Benefit District Tax, which is levied here at the city of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while it does not necessarily state that it needs to be reviewed, it also we are bringing it up this week to be renewed. So I appreciate your thoughts and I appreciate your work on this on this bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks so much. Any other comments on Amendment two? And of course, Councilmember Lewis will have the last word on this bill excuse me, on this amendment. Okay. Thank you so much to everyone for the conversation. I just want to sort of signal that unfortunately, I will not be able to support this amendment either, in large part because'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the reasons that Councilmember Robles articulated in her statement as well. And so I just wanted to, again, appreciate the sentiment with which this is brought forward and then really just provide a little bit of clarification to the general public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any council member at any time in any council at any time can you can introduce legislation to either repeal, amend or modify any any ordinances that we've passed in in the past. And so while I appreciate the significance of this sunset, I still think that, you know, whether this amendment passes or not, future councils will not have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'their hands tied one way or the other as it relates to future policy considerations on this revenue proposal or any other revenue proposal, frankly. So with that being said, I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Lewis, who can close out debate if he wishes, and then I will call the roll, have the clerk call the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'roll on this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'll be brief and in closing it out. Definitely appreciate the critical feedback from folks in regards to the overall concept of having a sunset clause. I do still think it's important that we have another opportunity to weigh in on it at this hearing and look forward to voting on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only thing that I would say is that I actually am, and maybe it's because I'm only going to be 50 years old in 20 years that that I actually am optimistic that we are going to be in a position to get progressive revenue from Olympia on a regional basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that we saw sort of a initial glimpse of that with Senator Wynne successful attempt at getting us a progressive real estate excise tax. You know, I've been engaged in a lot of conversations with stakeholders about getting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'State and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Local capital gains tax, which remains a passion of mine and something I will be introducing legislation here at the council to consider. But I do think that it's important that we continue to think of ourselves as a regional partner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that this amendment signals and centers that idea that we are committed to working together with the county and the state to come up with comprehensive revenue proposals that do make sure that we are also scaling our benefit across borders, make sure that we are being responsive and spreading the burden, quite frankly, to across the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'rest of the county and the rest of the state. Do I think it's going to happen fast now? Which is why I wouldn't wouldn't support a ten year sunset. And I'm now I'm proposing a 20 year sunset. So I think that that, unfortunately, probably more closely matches the timeline of what we're dealing with here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I look forward to giving us an opportunity to do we on this one more time. And I would just ask that we call the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So much, Councilmember Lewis. With that being said, I would ask the clerk, please call the roll on adoption of Amendment two.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lewis and I know that Councilmember Suarez also wanted to make a comment and she will let me know at what point she would like to do that. So, Councilmember Lewis, you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much, Madam President. I really appreciate the opportunity to have co-sponsored this legislation, along with council members Muscat, Gonzalez, Herbold and Strauss. I really do think that we can't wait any longer, echoing my comments from earlier.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To have true progressive revenue to confront head on the situation that we are facing here today on so many different fronts.

        "'speaker_3': 'of us that will rise to the ambitions and the scope of our problems. And this package really does get there. You know, I'm committed to a regional approach, as I talked earlier during our discussion of the sunset clause.'",

And we really are in a position where the cavalry is not going to come over the hill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, it doesn't look like there's going to be a special session of the legislature this year. It doesn't look like there's going to be bold action from the legislature to fill this void. We have a complete abdication of any kind of duty or responsibility from our federal executive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While we have lots of allies in Congress who have been fighting very valiantly to get us the resources that we need, federal leadership from the president has been completely absent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need to step in and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to raise this revenue. I, I appreciate that this follows on the model of House Bill 2907, the council member or our House member, then State Representative Nicole Macri, submitted in the last legislative session of only targeting positions, only taxing positions at large, very large and successful corporations that make over a certain amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I really appreciate that we made a couple of surgical exemptions to make sure that this tax does not fall on folks that are on the front line of the current public health issue that we're facing with COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm also just very appreciative that there is going to be a massive multiplier effect of this. I mean, we are passing this revenue package to bill. We are passing this revenue package to build housing, to support people, to stay in their housing, to make these investments at a truly unprecedented scale and rise to the level of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'challenge that we're facing. As the chair of the Select Committee on Homelessness Strategies and Investments, I can say unequivocally that this is going to help us move towards our goal of meeting our on righting the wrong of our long time shortfall in permanent supportive housing and making sure we are in a position to meet that obligation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So with that, I want to turn it over, proud to to vote for this today. And I'm going to again want to thank all the co-sponsors, and particularly Councilmember Skinner, for her leadership in guiding us through this.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate the effort that went into this the phone calls, the emails, the meetings to create a proposal for us to move forward. I know how much work was dedicated to this effort now and back in the fall of 2017, along with Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilmember Stewart and Councilmember Herbert, as I stated at the Budget Committee last week'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I do support a progressive revenue tax. I do support a tax on corporations. I have supported a countywide regional approach and also a statewide approach to a progressive tax solution. However, Judy, I can't support this proposal. I support the merits, though, not the procedural process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As was stated earlier, that we all know our city is facing the pandemic and economic recession that this country has never seen the likes of in civil unrest due to racism. Again, as I shared last week, this is a trifecta that is unprecedented because we're in the midst of this pandemic fueled economic recession with no end in'",

        "'speaker_3': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Front of the voters. Councilmember Lewis, a short note to you. To some of us, the Calvary is not a welcome sight. I just want to point out that no economist, no politician, no public policy, academic or expert can forecast when these challenges will end.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't know the depth, the length of the duration of this pandemic fueled recession. There's currently no jobs bill or stimulus package for growth while we face historic unemployment levels. And that concerns me. We don't know what the economic landscape looks like as we impose this tax again from city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I like what Portland did in May of 2020. Portland voters approved an income and a business tax for homelessness services to pass with nearly 60% of the vote. But the sunset clause for 2030 Oregon's unemployment rate is about 14% and Seattle's is 16%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I have participated in, observed and shared, Seattle has a well-established Democratic tradition of giving voters the final say. Again, as I shared in the last 15 years, the voters have approved over 11 city city levies from library to housing to education to transportation to park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Daily voters have also supported over six county wide levies for vets, human services, homelessness, seniors, children in parks and Seattle voters have supported two multi-billion dollar regional levies for transportation. As you all know, in 2006, the voters approved a small local payroll tax on businesses as part of bridging the gap transportation ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, that tax was repealed by council in 2009 due to the 2008 recession. I share this not as a compare and contrast lecture between levies and taxes, but to the testament that Seattle voters are smart, caring and generous.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I trust their civic judgment and voice. Again, nobody is against taxing corporations or a progressive tax. It's how we get there. At the end of the day, I trust the voters of Seattle to tax corporations so we can truly re-imagine the new economy and not be faced with another difficult choice to repeal this tax, as we did'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in 2008. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Juarez, are there any other comments from my colleagues? Councilmember Morales, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh. Okay. Thank you, colleagues. I'm, I will admit, very frustrated about the two amendments that just got added to this bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I don't want that to.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'fighting for it now desperately want to spin a narrative to discourage working class struggle and empowerment. Let's be real. The Amazon tax had nothing to do with the quote unquote, savvy of establishment politicians. It had everything to do with the self-organization of working people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Specifically, it has been the thread of the movement's ballot initiative that has pressured the city establishment to act. Amazon filed the ballot measure after a series of actual grassroots Democratic action conferences where hundreds of people, indeed by now thousands discussed and voted.'",

This helps us raise more funds for crucial investments without further burdening Seattle residents struggling on the smallest incomes. With this revenue, we can invest in COVID relief, rental assistance, affordable housing.'",

And we can help immigrant and refugee households that may be ineligible for federal relief programs, people who are living unsheltered in the black and brown communities that have been most impacted by COVID 19.'",

This new tax will be in addition to the business and occupation taxes, property taxes and business license fees paid by Seattle employers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to thank and commend our budget chair, Councilmember Mesquita. As a masterful legislator, she put together a more targeted proposal and worked in an open and collaborative way with many of us here on the city council and those in the community to incorporate various ideas to improve her already thoughtful tax and spend package.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I appreciate why many of my colleagues are going to vote yes today. I'd like to thank the thousands of District four constituents who took the time to provide input on this. And after much consideration and consultation with my constituents, my strong concerns remain.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'For now, just present a quick summary because I'm not planning to change my vote from our Budget Committee just a few days ago. Please note that later this month they will likely vote in favor of the short term COVID relief bill from Councilmember Mosqueda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the upcoming Council bill 119812, which will tap our City Government's Emergency Fund and revenue stabilization fund at amounts higher than proposed by our Mayor. I've consistently voted in favor of relief packages and regulatory changes to help those impacted most by the COVID crisis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The tax and spend packages before us today, however, are long term policies that require additional considerations. As I've mentioned before, I'm concerned that this is it penalizes only Seattle employers. It's not a regional solution. I'm concerned that companies providing tens of thousands of jobs to our residents may leave the city, and the small businesses that support the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'large employers could also be negatively impacted. I'm concerned that it does not exempt all nonprofits. No, I appreciate the amendment today for the health care providers.

        "'speaker_3': 'I'm concerned this is a situation where taxing first, asking questions later. As Councilmember Suarez noted, this does not give voters a choice. The tax before us today is four times larger than the head tax. The previous city council reversed just two years ago sending a large tax and spending proposal to the November ballot for voters to decide'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would have been consistent with other large tax measures and would provide more time to see whether the economy is recovering. Whether our state government can pass a better statewide or regional measure for revenue. Unfortunately, that idea was rejected at our Budget Committee last week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I feel that we could also do a better job looking for savings in our existing budget. I see common ground and points of unity emerging and how we look at our police budget. The large salaries there are also in other city departments, as noted in the recent investigation by Forbes magazine published on June 23rd.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The lessons learned as we dove into the police budget. Salaries could be applied to other city departments so that we expand social services, not government salaries. To me, that's not austerity, it's sustainability. I will look forward to joining my colleagues and pushing our governor and state legislature to pass progressive tax tools that our region can use.'",

And so as usual, we will end comment with hearing from the prime sponsor who is Councilmember Skate. I just wanted to chime in really quickly and say how much I appreciated the opportunity to reengage on this conversation.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'the the hard work that you and your staff have put in on on this important proposal. I think this is a smart approach. I think that it is an important approach. And I think that there is probably no other time like the present, where we have a triple crisis on our hands.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For us to not only consider this, but to take swift action, we are, at the end of the day, a nine member body that was elected by, in some cases, districts, and for Councilmember Mosqueda and I citywide. And we were elected to make tough decisions, to dig into the policy work, to identify significant policy issues and to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'identify potential solutions to those issues. That's part of the reason why I think now at this point, given this triple crisis, I do think that the political winds have significantly changed across the city. I think that our constituents across the city want us to take action now as opposed to punting to a ballot issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I feel more than comfortable showing up today in in this council meeting to vote yes on jump start for Seattle and to to be proud of the fact that I am one of the co-sponsors of this of this proposal.'",

And and all the calls that we have received in support of this bill is really important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, part of the record that shows to me that that that our constituents expect us to take action as their elected representatives on the city council.

The type of depression that we will soon be facing is no longer going to be considered a recession in the near future. And we we must shift our priorities, shift to make sure that we're investing in those who are the most vulnerable and those who've been historically'",

Jumpstart Seattle provides that alternative to make sure that we have the funding needed to respond immediately to the COVID crisis and to make sure that there is not an austerity budget that lands in our lap this fall.'",
