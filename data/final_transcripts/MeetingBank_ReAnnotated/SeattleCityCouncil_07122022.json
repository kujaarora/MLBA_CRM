Decisions are not rushed without full analysis of the options we have as this is 100 year infrastructure. I'm here to assist with any cost saving option in Ballard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can show you where they are. I live. Breathe that community. It's my community. And it is critical again for an entrance to be west of 15th because the housing and commercial core is west of 15th. The sound transit ridership projections are highest coming from west of 15th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the reason that we need that station entrance is because 15th Avenue Northwest is the third used most used North-South corridor in the city, only behind S.R. 99. And I-5, asking pedestrians to cross 15th Avenue at grade will impact ridership and is not aligned with our city's Vision Zero commitment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also heard during committee both Montlake and Broadway received station entrances and pedestrian infrastructure to also avoid similar issues. Lastly, I'll note that the 14th Avenue station option abuts the industrial district. As in, when you exit the station, you are in the industrial district and the land to the northeast is not zoned for maximum density, with neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_0': 'residential in close proximity. The densest zoning and housing core in Ballard is between 24th and Fifth Avenue Northwest North all the way to 65th. This is why 15 Avenue Northwest is the preferred alignment and we need grade separation, a grade separated connection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If 14th Avenue is going to be considered. Again, as always, I'm committed to seeing this project through to Tacoma and to Everett. And we have to understand that we have to do our part here in the city and sound transit.'",
