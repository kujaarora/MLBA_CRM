        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President So this bill would delay the effective date of the heating oil tax on heating oil service providers. Colleagues may remember that in response to community concerns about the impact of this tax, particularly on low and middle income households during COVID, we delayed implementation last August, delayed through 2020 September 1st, 2021.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another reason for the delay was related to Washington's pollution liability insurance agencies, new heating oil loan and grant program. We what had been discussed as a grant program last year now sounds like it might be going to a loan program.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I do want to thank members of Teamsters 174 and other labor partners who've contacted me about this bill. Many of their members would themselves be subject to this and are frankly nervous about the impacts of having to, you know, have pay the tax that would be passed on to them and also just bear the cost of making'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I will be voting yes on this legislation to delay the implementation of the heating oil tax that Durkan first proposed a year and a half ago. The climate emergency is an existential threat to all of humanity, and we must have a serious and internationalist approach to ending greenhouse gas emissions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in this case, unfortunately, the heating oil tax is not a serious approach. Yes, heating oil is a terrible fuel. But the reality is people in Seattle do not need a tax to motivate them to switch away from heating oil.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Heating oil is expensive, dirty and inconvenient. And the main reason people still use oil burning heaters in Seattle is when they are simply unable to afford to switch to something better. Ideally electricity. My office discussed between 50 Seattle and they confirmed that from their outreach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They found that it is overwhelmingly poor and working class households that have oil heaters and people are switching to other types of heaters whenever they have the means to do so. Ultimately, that means that mail Durkin's proposed climate solution is yet another regressive tax, which is not a surprise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is very dangerous. Not only does the tax have a very small potential impact on the climate positive impact to deal with the climate crisis. It also adds to the false narrative of blaming consumers and ordinary people for the climate emergency, which lets the big businesses responsible for 90% of greenhouse gas emissions off the hook.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need the opposite. We need we need measures that will actually change the way corporations are functioning. And ultimately, what we need is a militant climate justice movement nationwide and internationally that can take fossil fuel companies into democratic public ownership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also need to fight for policies on the way to achieving all of those larger goals, which are frankly, urgently needed. That is why the Amazon tax movement fought to tax big businesses to fund the Green New Deal, for Seattle, to make funding available for people to retrofit their homes, for weatherization, and to get away from fossil'",
        "'speaker_3': 'fuels. And the big business taxes we won include a substantial 20 million climate infrastructure investment paid for by taxes on polluting big businesses, not on working people. Of course, $20 million is far less than is needed because the Amazon tax will significantly reduce when it was rebranded as Jumpstart in an attempt to minimize the essential impact of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the grassroots movement. If climate organizers are motivated to fight to increase the Amazon tax next year, to expand the investments for dealing with the climate crisis, and we should absolutely be fighting for that. My office will obviously be standing with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city also needs to support the Stop the money pipeline movement, demand to boycott the financial institutions and insurance companies that fund fossil fuel infrastructure like tar sands pipeline. This is an excellent example of policies that we need to do in the here and now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My office as chair of the Sustainability and Renters Rights Committee is preparing legislation to empower the Green New Deal Oversight Board to review and rank financial institutions and insurance companies applying for City of Seattle grants. It is big business and the super rich that control the infrastructure of our society under capitalism.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Colleagues, I'm excited to be voting on this legislation today after nearly nine months of collaborative negotiations with the executive to develop this legislation. I believe that establishing the Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts will create a more open, transparent and robust forecasting process that will enhance both the Council's and the public's access to and understanding of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'city's budgetary forecasts. The implementation of this office should also improve the dynamic between future councils and future mayors by building a stronger foundation of trust and balance between the branches as it relates to the development of the city's budget priorities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are two prominent events during 2020 forecasting process that highlighted for me and many others how important it is to level the playing field between the council and the mayor's office with regard to our access to information related to the city's forecasting process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those events prompted me, my staff and central staff, to look at alternative models for how governmental bodies develop their budget forecasts. And indeed, both Washington State and King County utilize independent forecasting offices that are outside of the legislative and executive branches.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'King County went so far as to pursue a voter approved charter amendment in 2008 in order to create their Office of Economic and Financial Analysis. Fortunately, based on my and central staff's review of the analysis conducted by our City Attorney's Office, we at the City Council are able to establish our own independent office in a manner consistent'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with our city charter. And the legislation we're voting on today is reflective of all of the feedback that we received from the city attorney's review and their legal advice upon its creation. The Economic Revenue Forecast Office would provide independent forecasts and economic analysis, fulfilling the policy intent of the Council budget action that this Council previously took.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was included in the 2021 budget that was adopted. It would also consist of three and a half full time equivalents through a combination of newly created positions and transferred positions from our city budget Office and Finance and Administrative Services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This new office would be headed by a director who would be hired by and report to a new forecast council comprised of the mayor, the city finance director, the council president and the Council Budget Chair, or their respective designees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Forecast Council would be responsible for providing oversight of the new office and for approving the forecasts. The Governance and Education Committee did have a conversation and presentation on this particular proposed piece of legislation and unanimously recommended that the Council bill be passed and adopted by the full Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd like to encourage my colleagues to join us in voting to adopt this legislation. Are there any comments on the bill? Councilman Strauss, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think your council president will be supporting this legislation today. I think this is a smart choice to remove a city, but to create a an office forecast office that is not tied to either the executive or the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm just going to take this moment to really share kudos of the city budget office. Last year during the recession and reopening of our of our economy. Because as compared to the state level the city budget office really did an amazing job of making accurate predictions that we could work off of as compared to the state that'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Strauss. Really appreciate that. Any other customer, Herbold, please. Thank you. Just really quickly, I also want to thank you, Council President Gonzales, for moving forward. The intent that the council expressed again under your leadership during the budget discussions last year to create this independent office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is, I think, considered a best practice and really appreciate knowing that moving forward, whether or not it's at times when there are increased revenue forecasts or or potential reductions in revenue, that the Council will have access to that information as opposed to sort of the current practice where an often we find it out at the same'",
        "'speaker_0': 'time when there are budget proposals to. To cut or add. So it will allow us as the body that is most responsive, engaged with the public to to give input to those budget discussions and decisions. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Peterson, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President. I wanted to also explain my support for this new office. There were some articles written about this proposal recently that delved into legal issues and looking at the city charter. And I think that it was healthy to to to raise these issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did some additional research, got additional comfort with with that aspect of it from a from a practical standpoint, having worked for a budget chair many years ago and the timing of these revenue forecasts has also been a source of frustration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think it's important to to have both branches collaborating on on this. This data about what the revenues are going to be, how we're predicting them, and having that information at the same time so that we're so that legislative branch isn't sitting around waiting.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilor Pearson. Appreciate that. Any additional comments on the bill? I've not seen any other hands raised, so I'll go ahead and closes out. I think Councilmember Peterson stole the words right out of my mouth. And that's the note that I wanted to end on, is that I think that as the budget appropriation authority, it has'",
        "'speaker_0': 'seemed odd to me in the six years that I have served on the council to oftentimes feel like we are caught on the back of our heels when we're receiving revenue forecast changes in the middle of and sometimes towards the end of our budgeting processes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that this bill will allow for more equitable access to information and to more timely access to relevant information in a way that will really allow and facilitate for the co-equal branches of government at government, at the city of Seattle, to really function like co-equal branches of government, and to make sure that both of us'",
