I was a lifelong resident, a community activist and educator living over 40 years in the Beacon Hill neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He was a Seattle native, a Garfield High School Bulldog alum, a Seattle Central and YouTube alum.

He had so many accounts, accomplishments and and actually changed lives and successfully turned high risk youth towards high demand occupations. You heard testimony in that regard and did it in an innovative way and certainly always with love in his heart.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From a personal note, you know, I know now for decades and decades and what we heard so much about what he did when he was alive and as many people that I've unfortunately lost over the years, I learned about as much about him in his life as I did when he was dealing with battling his illness.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Still fought, still courageous, still inspirational, and still funny and loving. And that was an owl that we so loved and so respected. So again, I'd like to thank all of the community members. I actually was given a list of names to to thank, but that's always a dirty, dangerous journey to go down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'll just say thank you all that. I have many names and many people who should be thanked. And we'll have a celebration after our legislative hearing this afternoon. Another personal note. When I first decided to run for office, I sat down with Al.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'This piece of legislation before you, Mr. President, truly comes from a collaborative effort that was rooted in community, rooted in the experience of domestic workers who came forward and bravely shared their stories like they've done today. This conversation did not begin here in Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In fact, I remember six years ago sitting with Hilary Stern on behalf of Casa Latina at the time and National Employment Law Project and so many others asking, what could we do at the state level? Because eight other states, Mr. President, have put into law the ability to protect domestic workers and where we haven't made strides at'",

        "'speaker_9': 'racist or sexist reasons. We here in Seattle have shown leadership. And today, because of your work, we are showing leadership again today. A year ago, I sat down with domestic workers and pledged to them that we would pass the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights.'",

And today's work is only possible because employers, through hiring entities and workers from the Domestic Workers Coalition, came together to identify the first steps, the foundation for which we can build upon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Historically, this population has been left out, and today is just a first step towards moving forward on the priorities you have identified.

        "'speaker_9': 'is an opportunity for us to constantly engage and to create policy together that will lift up workers, improve standards, and actually improve the lives of families and our community. And let's remember who domestic workers are, as you so eloquently heard today, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Domestic workers are more likely to be women, people of color, immigrants. They've been excluded from our national labor protections. They've been isolated in nature in many situations due to their work environment. And the reality is, their work makes the work of this city possible.'",

And they've been left out of labor laws. But today we pass some basic protections to make sure that those who are caring for our most vulnerable and caring for our homes are truly cared'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for. This piece of legislation is remarkable, and that brought together ideas from hiring entities and domestic workers, national experts and local communities, and identified ways in which we can push forward hard conversations, identify low hanging fruit policies, and elevate the voice of workers by creating a board.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This work is because of all of the effort, time and commitment you've put into this. And we will, as you heard, continue to add add to this so that we can do more. As Tai sang about today, this work is truly about how we extend basic protections to those who've been historically left out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if I may, Mr. President, there's about five elements I'd like to highlight, please. The first that's most important is that we're expanding basic protections to access minimum wage for all domestic workers. We've defined domestic workers as truly those who engage in the act of domestic work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So whether you're an independent contractor and you own your own business or you're an individual who cleans ten houses a day, or you care for one or two families a week, every domestic worker now has the right to at least earn the minimum wage, if not more.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this gives a table to move from. We've extended the right to have access to basic rest and meal break protections because you are caring for our most vulnerable, you are caring for our homes and the right to have a rest or a meal break should be extended to every worker, no matter your workplace, no matter your'",
        "'speaker_9': 'type of work, because you need rest so you can take care of our most vulnerable. There is a document that's being handed out right now because a lot of folks have asked us to provide clarification on how rest and meal breaks can be provided.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to thank the Office of Labor Standards for the two page memo that's being passed around, which really says it is very simple. If you work more than 4 hours, you are entitled to a ten minute break.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you are working an eight hour day, you ought to have an uninterrupted meal break. Those are basic protections that we've applied to the labor force overall. And now you have a right to that type of leave so that you can get the rest you need.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have included privacy protections because as you may have heard today, or if you participated in those eight committee hearings that we had, you heard time and time again that many domestic workers had their documents withheld, their original passports, their visas, their work permits.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that is not acceptable. It creates a sort of indentured servitude, if you will, where people can't leave. They can't feel like they can leave the house without fear of retaliation because they need those documents. We have now protected your ability to keep those original documents and assumes that if you were retaliated against for speaking up and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it's based on your documentation status, we will protect you and your status because right now especially, we must stand up for our most vulnerable workers, regardless of documentation. And we've done that in this legislation. To our friends who have said that we we know that workers are more protected when there is a document in front of them'",
        "'speaker_9': 'which outlines their rights. This Domestic Bill of Rights provides a model notice of rights that the Office of Labor Standards is going to provide and make available to all workers and hiring entities. So there is a basis to build from and we know that you will continue to look at that at the board, which will consider additional'",

And lastly, Mr. President, we also want to underscore the importance, importance of constantly centering policy decisions based on the lived experience. And that is why I am so incredibly proud to have this legislation in front of you, which reflects your ask.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You asked us to create a board so that we could have ongoing dialog, so that there could be hiring entities and domestic workers and a community partner who come together to constantly evaluate how we can do more things like making sure that we're applying innovative solutions to basic protections that are already under state law, like overtime and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'paid sick leave. I want to see retirement and health care. These are some really important protections that we need to apply to all domestic workers and recognize the unique nature of someone who cleans homes or takes care of our loved ones or cleans cleans our yards or takes care of our kiddos.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have to apply this in a thoughtful way, and I know that the board is going to prioritize that. And as other provisions in the law. We also want to make sure that we have ongoing feedback and we have required the ability to get those reports not only to the board.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We don't want a document that's going to sit on the shelves. We want action. So it puts into the piece of legislation a requirement that we respond to the board's requests and recommendations in a timely fashion so that true policy change is being made and documents are not just sitting on shelves.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've already waited far too long. These issues have been sitting on the back burner for decades. Now we are taking the first steps and we will continue to do so with your voice at the center. I also want to say, Mr. President, we have a memo here from council member Herbold, who chairs our committee that has oversight'",

Councilmember Herbold is committed to developing a companion ordinance that will be heard in committee on the on Tuesday, August 14th, and that will include domestic workers and hiring entities and talk about how we can extend basic protections against discrimination and amend the Seattle Municipal Code to make sure that we are fulfilling our values, that no'",

I want to thank the employers who come out to support domestic workers who recognized the interconnectedness and interdependence of our lives and dignity.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'I admire your courage, your strength, and I will continue to work with you every single day to make other work possible, because your work makes our work possible. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Workers Rights Committee, the her committee working with council member Teresa Mascara, has been a real joy. As you know, in the last six months. She has worked tirelessly, eight committee hearings in which we attended and went over drafts and comments and implemented, incorporating changes and concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the things that I find most rewarding about this job is when you work with somebody, you can have legislation. But sometimes at the core of it, what you're seeing in Councilmember Mascara is humanity, concern, care about protecting people who work hard, who take care of our children, who take care of our elderly, who take'",

And having someone so articulate who believes in fighting for labor and workers has been a wonderful, has been a joy, has been an education.

        "'speaker_2': 'And as a representative to bring issues, as she was saying, the great economy and the people who mainly are affected by this type of when we don't have these protections, or mainly women of color who are immigrants, who don't speak English, and we deal with these issues all the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. Is this a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Perfect piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of legislation? No. Do we have a board where we're moving forward? Absolutely. And we're going to finally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have a voice.'",

I'm just truly grateful for your leadership, but also just the spirit with which you brought to this legislation. We've been working for nearly eight months, and I also want to acknowledge all the people who participated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Meeting after meeting, you came to the listening sessions. You came and talked with us. You gave us your stories. And I want to acknowledge the fact that as Councilmember Mosquito, your leadership, I've appreciated so much, but also the fact that we know that every worker deserves respect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You have stood up and shown us that time after time. And I want just to appreciate you individually, personally and my colleague, Councilmember Muscat. And of course, I'm supporting this. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Baxter. Customers want. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, President Harrell. Thank you to all the workers who not only came today but have organized and spoken out about the conditions faced by domestic workers. Most of all, thanks to the domestic workers themselves, because it takes courage to talk about your own conditions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those conditions are a clear example of why workers need unions and other worker organizations and their own political organizations because workers with their own organizations have the power to stop the abuses that occur. I especially wanted to thank organizations like Casa Latina who are organizing some of the most work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For organizing workers who face oppression on many levels as workers, as immigrants, as women, as people of color, not to mention the conditions that are faced by the non documented among us. I will of course be voting yes on this bill and I fully support the rights for workers, domestic workers rights that it contains.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As a worker myself, as a union member, myself, and as a socialist, this is extremely important. Workers power is in our unity, and domestic workers are too often isolated in each home that they work in. One of the good things from such legislation is that your voice comes out into the forefront, and there's a potential for your'",
        "'speaker_2': 'voice as domestic workers to be united with the voice of other workers who may not face your conditions specifically, but who need to be united with you both for your sake and for their sake. Because when we stand together, we stand stronger.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I mentioned, I'm supporting this bill today, but we should also be clear about what rights it provides and what issues have not been addressed yet. This bill makes clear that domestic workers, including those classified as independent contractors, may not be paid less than Seattle's minimum wage and must be guaranteed the federally mandated breaks available to other'",
        "'speaker_2': 'workers. These rights are fundamental, and while many domestic workers classified as workers, are already legally entitled to these rights, it is important to make sure that workers being classified as independent contractors don't fall into a loophole. This bill also makes it clear that workers cannot legally be retaliated against for demanding their rights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And most importantly, it prohibits taking domestic workers, passports or other documentation. Although enforcement of that needs to be followed up on and that will need domestic workers to continue fighting for themselves beyond today's step in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, as domestic workers Maria Luisa and the sister from Honduras, whose name unfortunately I didn't catch, and workers like Robin Rose and Elijah Blagg, who are here to speak today, dozens of workers, domestic workers are informing my office and I'm sure others are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Domestic workers themselves know that there are many things that need to be done beyond this bill. One of the things is, and this is something that my office discussed with other council members, but also I'm hearing more from nannies throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This bill does not protect domestic workers facing sexual harassment, and that is going to be addressed and other forms of discrimination which we know happens too often. And I thank the senator from Honduras for sharing, sharing that story.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was obviously just a terrible experience. And I wanted all the workers to know that my office is at the ready to do whatever is required to help enact that legislation. Another issue that needs to be addressed urgently is the lack of retirement accounts for domestic workers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maria Luisa mentioned that and we have heard this from other workers. Personally and also in previous public comment testimonies. A domestic worker who was hired as an independent contractor pays six Social Security taxes, and then they pay the employer's share of the Social Security taxes, also because they are an independent contractor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then if they are undocumented, they cannot even collect Social Security when they retire. For many, that means a family becomes the only, literally the only safety net for all the domestic workers. Future legislation will need to address this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Domestic workers being classified as independent contractors as one of the issues the nanny that spoke to our office highlighted precisely because of the tax issue. Ideally, domestic workers should be categorized as workers, not independent contractors. But at the very least, the domestic workers that are categorized as contractors should be paid extra by the employer to cover the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'employer's share of the Social Security taxes. This can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. The that minimum wage workers will need to find to pay the IRS every April. Future legislation does need to address that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And not only I should mention for domestic workers, but this is also relevant for Uber and Lyft drivers and other workers who are defined as independent contractors but work and live on the margins. Another issue my office has heard during the listening sessions and then again over the weekend, is the importance of guaranteed hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Domestic workers currently have to worry about suddenly losing hours if their employer goes on vacation or something like that. When you live paycheck to paycheck, losing a week's wages can mean not making a rent. Some domestic workers have contracts with their employers that guarantees being paid for a minimum number of work hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But many do not have contracts, and many of you correctly said we need contracts for all domestic workers. And so I think that is something that we should be addressing. Future legislation should be taking up all of these issues, which is providing contract to domestic workers, guaranteed hours, paid time off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Double taxation, protections for independent contractors, sexual harassment, retirement, and other discrimination protections. These are the sort of workplace protections that are built into any union contract. But any union member would also tell you that nothing is automatic, and winning those union contracts requires organization and struggle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is why I appeal to all the workers here today that while it is really positive that the board is being set up, if we want to see the full result and win full rights, then you as workers should be actively engaged and involved and at the forefront of the struggle for your own rights as you all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fight to expand your rights. My office is fully at your disposal. Let us build a strong movement to win the substantive rights so that it is not put off told to the future. And so I wanted to once again thank all the domestic workers who have shown incredible courage to speak out and get organized.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your workers will make it easier for other workers to see that they too can have an impact. I vote yes on this Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, and I look forward to fighting alongside you all to expand those rights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember miscarriage like a closed debate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Wow. We have taken the first step. We are about to vote on a second. I just want to reiterate a few pieces. Tuesday, the 14th of August, is when council member Herbold will have the draft in front of us to extend protections for protected classes and including sexual harassment protections, which we would have done in this piece'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of legislation. But the title was too tight, so that's why we have a trailer bill. So our work continues. Yeah. I want to thank our council colleagues, all of the amendments that folks brought to our attention. Any concerns, questions, ideas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have incorporated those with the 11 amendments that we passed in our committee last Thursday. So thank you all for your engagement in this process as well. Thanks. Also specifically, I want to call out Casa Latina who brought to light the issues around health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Who who brought to light the issues around independent contractors and the importance of protecting those who've created their own business, and the ability for folks to be able to maintain their business that they've grown. We want to keep that perspective in mind as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I do have a few. Thank you, Mr. President. And I know you warned against that because we could always leave someone out. But if I may, Mr. President, I'd like to continue with our.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I'd like to thank again Casa Latina. Who? Working Washington. Working Washington. SEIU 775 National Domestic Workers Alliance for the We Dream and Black Coalition. And 21 progress as well. Thank you all for all of your work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm going to try to go through these next ones relatively quickly, Mr. President, to the employers, the individuals who hire domestic workers, the hiring entities. You came to the table and recognize that we can only level the playing field.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We can only highlight those employers who've done the right thing. If we truly create policies and statutes that lift up those hiring entities and make sure that everyone is playing by the rules. Thank you. Seattle Nanny Network Hand in Hand.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'April Lane. Thank you to Emily Dills, Jessica Renner, Theresa Hollis, Hannah Littman. And I also look forward to working with the Seattle area nannies who are bringing forward ideas as well. Can we give them a huge round of applause?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To the advocates and experts. Thank you so much. I see some of you in the audience. Thanks to National Employment Law Project Moms Rising Center for American Progress, National Domestic Workers Lands Again and Image Catalog. Thank you guys so much for all of your work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. President, our work here would not be possible without the work of those who make Seattle City Hall run.
