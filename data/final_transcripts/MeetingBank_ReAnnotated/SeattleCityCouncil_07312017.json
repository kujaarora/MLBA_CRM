        "'speaker_4': 'First, that all surveillance technology determinations made by an executive process, including both those determined to be surveillance technology and those determined not to be, would need to be included in this list. And the second would be a citation to all surveillance technology determinations for the previous 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then lastly, with regard to the CTO quarterly list of the Council changes of the designation of technology on the list, meaning if we move it from one category to another, that action needs to be filed with the clerk and the quarterly list needs to be updated accordingly with regard to retrospective approval of technologies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These amendments reflect the order in which our requests for existing technologies will be brought to the Council and requires that they be identified by the executive with the ability of council to revise that order. And instead of and this is in place of of the process which was originally in the base ordinance, which would require review of'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I want to say a lot of words. Okay, here we go. This legislation repeals and replaces Chapter 1418 of the Seattle Municipal Code with the new Chapter 1418. The intent of the legislation is to govern. The city's acquisition and use of surveillance technology require a publicly transparent and accountable process for procurement and operation of surveillance technology, and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'establish protocols for city departments to mitigate civil liberties concerns and incorporate racial equity principles into such protocols. Key components of the legislation include but are not limited to the following requiring city departments intending to acquire surveillance technology to obtain council ordinance approval of the acquisition and an accompanying surveillance impact report requiring city departments to complete one or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'more community meetings related to the technology prior to requesting Council approval. Requiring departments to submit surveillance impact reports for each technology. Requesting Council approval requiring an annual equity impact assessment. Requesting annual reviews by the City Auditor and Future Inspector General for public safety.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It creates a private right of action and it. That existing surveillance technologies must receive council approval over time, and it directs the creation of a work group to make recommendations on how to utilize community expertize for the purposes of advising this Council on future acquisitions of surveillance technology.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's the basic aspects of the substance of the bill. And if there are no questions on that, then I would provide other council members an opportunity to chime in and then I would like to make closing remarks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very good. Any further comments on this ordinance dealing with surveillance technology?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Burgess. Thank you. President Harrell. Thank you, Councilmember Gonzales, for your leadership over the last almost a year of carefully reviewing this legislation and making sure that it reflects not only our values but our intent to protect privacy, but also to allow the city to use appropriate technologies to deliver city services and maintain peace and safety in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'our neighborhoods. I think we've accomplished that purpose here. And I know that you've also spoken for work that you're going to take up next year. Good luck at that.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We'll bring you back.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Any further comments, concerns one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, President Howell. I will be voting in favor of this ordinance because it is a step in the right direction. But I think we have to be clear, as several members of the community and organizations have spoken in public testimony today, that the ordinance, as will be voted on today, will not actually protect the privacy of'",

The and I strongly agree with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American Civil Liberties Union, the City of Seattle, Human Rights Commission, and others who spoke in public comment and who have written in the past that surveillance data should be included in a strong ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know the Council has talked about it, but I think the point that was made is really important, that we need it, need it in an expedited fashion. What I find most concerning is that even though the logic of the committee discussions was towards including surveillance data, it seemed that subsequent to strong objections by the Seattle'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Police Department, surveillance data was removed from the bill. And that I think that needs to be addressed very carefully. Just to give an example of why this is important. Seattle claims to be a sanctuary city, so the Seattle Police Department is not allowed to share immigration status with ICE.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, if we don't have a strong position, you know, a law on surveillance data, then there's nothing to stop Seattle police from sharing personal data, hypothetically, like images of tattoos, of, you know, of individuals and something that's gathered by a convenience store security camera.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's nothing to stop the SBT from sharing such images from any number of law enforcement agencies around the country that are willing to share that information with ICE. And I think with the chilling messages that have been sent by the Trump administration, we should be doubly anxious to pass this person an ordinance that covers surveillance data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is an example of a consequence of omission from this bill. So I will be supporting this bill, but I really strongly support community members and organizations who have said that we need to move with all haste to close the loopholes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Comes from a swamp. Any further comments? I'd like to just thank publicly Councilman Gonzales again and her committee for this leadership. I think we're at a time where clearly technology has gotten in front of some of our policies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have been and I've been proposing, as many have done, proposing technological solutions to areas of transportation and public safety, environmental sustainability and education. And last week, I visited with a delegation from Kobe, Japan, a microsoft cybersecurity campus, to look at all of what's sort of going on in the world of hacking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think Shankar talked a little bit about the the hackers conference in I and I study that and just to know how sort of scary it is some of this is state sponsored, by the way, in different countries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and so as as employees of the city of Seattle, I think our responsibilities are are heightened in terms of both not only the information we use, but the information we furnish. And so I heard loudly and clearly, councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Czar is commitment to make sure that we continue this great policy works very complex because again we are we are the technology and the software and hardware are rapidly changing and becoming more sophisticated. So I welcome that work and we certainly work with her in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any further comments on the base legislation? Want to do some wrap up comments from booksellers?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will. I just I want to just first, I'm going to start off by thanking my committee colleagues, council member Bagshaw and Burgess for sticking sticking it out with me in this very complex subject, too. And I also want to thank all of the departments who provided us feedback, not just SBT, but we heard back from our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Human Services Department, from our Parks Department, from every single department about how this ordinance might impact their business operations. I want to thank them all for being responsive and getting us the information that we needed. Our Seattle City office, the mayor's office, especially David Mendoza, our city budget office, Amy CI, and Brianna Thomas, of course.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Last but not least, Amy Scott and Brianna Thomas, who put a lot of time into this. And so collectively, we have spent hundreds of hours over the past eight months to get us this far. And I just want to be really clear that like Councilmember Swan and others up here in this dais, I, I also agree with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the ACLU of Washington and with CARE and with the Seattle Human Rights Commission and with the many other organizations who have articulated to us a need to tackle the questions of surveillance data that are generated by the city, by the city, or by people outside of the city that have a real impact in how our communities trust'",
        "'speaker_4': 'us and be, and how our communities are actually impacted by policing or by other types of consequences as a result of collection of that data. And I think we all share that deep concern. And my hope is that we acknowledge that this is a Phase one approach and that this is a good first step in the right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'direction. And and that we will venture down the path of having a phase two. And that in that phase two, we will we will eventually be able to struggle with these issues and hopefully become the first municipality in the country to actually tackle the complex issues related to surveillance data that are disconnected from surveillance technology that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'acquire and that or that we ask others to operate on our on our behalf. But the reality is, is that no other city has tackled this yet. And just because it's complex doesn't mean that we shouldn't. In fact, those are the issues that we should be tackling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think I hope the advocates here from the dais appear that we're all committed to heading down that path and to really making sure that we stand up a process where we can take a look at those very serious issues that are not included in this bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that, my hope is, will be included in a future bill as soon as as soon as we can make that happen. So I want to thank you all for staying committed to having these tough conversations and for doing so in an incredibly respectful, thoughtful way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that this is just our first adventure together in this area, and I look forward to working on the bigger issues as well.'",

Maybe we'll do some Q&A, if there is any, and then I'd like the chance to circle back around and make some closing comments'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So with your permission, I would just add that there's a couple of elements here in the substitute council bill that I think warrants mentioning. We have made some technical changes to what we refer to as the jingles in the bill.'",

There's a clarification in this that Councilmember O'Brien suggested to ensure that our existing transfer of development rights continue to be an option for. For achieving development rights in the Chinatown International District area.'",

The first was referenced in public comment and it eliminates reference to the historic Manila town. I want to say thank you to Brian and Betty for bringing that forward.'",

I mean, I think the the things that I would add around the base legislation are effectively the you know, this legislation implements our mandatory housing affordability program. And as we've heard in many of the neighborhoods where we've adopted this program, there's a lot that goes alongside housing affordability that can't be undertaken in our land use code'",

I also want to thank Councilmembers Johnson and Central Staff for working with my office and under Councilor in particular in my office. I think we have a much better product as a result of all of that work.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Preservation of of properties that are unreinforced masonry and thus have issues of safety in rental housing. But also, I think the conversation that has been keyed up around the future of a potential property tax growth fund could be also used not only to.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I'll move to substitute version four for version three. Second, all those in favor of the substitution. But I, I, I have it. Okay, so we've already talked about it and I'll just say a few, few remarks and that is, I just want to thank, first of all, Councilmember Johnson, the committee again for their leadership and slowing it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'down a little bit, but not to a complete halt, because I think the community has spoken loudly and to some extent. There's obviously been some differences of opinion, even some arguments. But I always contend that people only argue about things they care about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The things that really matter in the Chinatown International District is indeed a gem. And it's a gem because not only is it rare and special, but it's worthy of being maintained and invested in to, in a sense and a proposition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to invest in it. And what I've been very pleased about during the outreach is that we saw not only people with gray hair or no hair advocating as they have for decades. And I see a few leaders here as well, that it has become a gem because of folks like Sharon and Frank and others in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dawson. I could just go down the list, but I was very pleased to see the younger generation and Tom the younger and I'll put you in the younger generation time, the younger generation at the testimony that they are as passionate as many of us have been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think that you have city leaders that understand the unique character of this very special part of town. It will continue to succeed and we will have and make sure we bring in the right the right investments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We won't be exempted like the historic core certain areas. It wasn't because well, let me put it in a positive way. It was because we realized that it is very precious and we're trying to go slowly enough to where we take the community with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we're again, we're trying to activate and bring in some economic development and bring in affordable housing. And the elephant in the room is displacement. And so we tried to address that head on with our strategies. And by the way, displacement is not unique to the Chinatown International District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's happening all over this country as people migrate toward course cities. So we are in this fight together. But I hope that you believe we try to come out in a real good place with what are in some cases, modest up zones, but indeed a good package in a daze.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I want to thank all of you for your continued advocacy for our communities you love and have fought so hard for. And Councilmember Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just briefly, I want to say a couple of things about sort of the wrap up. Councilmember Herbold did a great job of thanking the many community partners who helped us along the way. But there's a couple that I just want to add to Friends of Little Saigon, thanks to Kwan and Yandi for the many hours that they've'",
        "'speaker_7': 'spent with us on this project. And I also want to say thanks to Sunny and several of other folks who spent a lot of time working with us on on this issue. You know, the there's a lot going on in the Chinatown international districts right now between the work that we're doing around public safety, between the work'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that we're doing on commercial affordability, that are really outside the scope of zoning changes but are all very interrelated. We want to reemphasize again the the language, the zoning changes that we adopted. They don't make any change to the historic core of the of the international district, Chinatown.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in addition, in that historic core, there are dozens of projects with more than a thousand units of affordable housing. None of those units go away. None of those projects go away. All those will continue to stay affordable for the folks that are living there today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The program's implementation will result in new affordable housing units coming online, which is, I think, really important for us to remind folks of. And it's important because a lot of families of a lot of different incomes are being displaced from the city right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we want places for all those families to be able to call home.
