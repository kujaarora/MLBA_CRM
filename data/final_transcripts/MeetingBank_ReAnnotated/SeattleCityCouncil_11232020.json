        "'speaker_3': 'on on collecting this revenue, because I know we can put it to good use collectively. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Peterson. I appreciate those comments. Any other comments? I see Councilman Mesquita, then Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Madam President. Thank you, colleagues, for all of the work that you've done to support this revenue effort, but also to, I think, strengthen the final language that accompanied it. I appreciate Aaron House working in our office on the amendment language Councilmember Perez, the council president Gonzalez included and passed and I want to thank'",
        "'speaker_6': 'members of the building construction trades, ironworkers, laborers who will have a seat at the table as we look at the data for determining where the investments go. And just again, to underscore my comments from earlier, recognizing that there is a lot of shared priorities when we look at infrastructure related to bridges that our busses and bikers and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'pedestrians do use these bridges. So looking forward to that conversation and having a data driven analysis to really point this in the right direction here in the very short time frame that we've now scaled back. So thanks to the community at large and looking forward to getting more information from you all as you can be in very'",
        "'speaker_6': 'soon, but I think was the right thing to do for folks together. And thanks again to our friends from the building trades for being part of that discussion, along with the transit advocates and broader community that will be coming together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Herbert Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'll be brief. I voted for this previously in the in the Budget Committee. Certainly was disappointed that the initial proposal on the dedication of these resources for bridge maintenance didn't go through. I will be voting in favor again today at the full council, but remain committed that if not on this funding resource at'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the end of the stakeholder process, that this Council will continue to look for four ways to find additional resources to meet the maintenance funding goals outlined in the recent audit. I'm for bridge maintenance and that will still be considered a potential source as we go through the community stakeholder process and to determine where some of these resources'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can go. I and and by voting today, I am affirming that that is a process that should go forward and that we should have this discussion about how we are going to make these important investments. So with that, I'll be voting in favor, and I appreciate the moment to just make those remarks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for those remarks. Councilmember Herbold. You're a mutant, so you are ready. I wasn't muted. Oh, my goodness. All right, well, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just trying to keep things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Interesting here. Again, council members voted five four to such a substitute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A version that adopted a fee. This is a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Version that I was a co-sponsor of. But at that time, the the the vote was to remove the specified funding for bridge maintenance instead. In this version, a stakeholder process will develop a proposal for use of the funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I voted no on the revised proposal because I'm concerned that the Council is handing the decision of whether we should provide funding necessary to partially implement auditor recommendations to a stakeholder group who might decide that the funds should be used for other purposes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe it's up to the Council and the mayor to make the tough decisions on how to implement recommendations of the city auditor. Sometimes that that means funding items that there are competing needs for. But by doing so, because the city auditor has identified it as as as critical.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm concerned that this practice creates a troubling precedent that undermines SNC 3.40.050, which reads that under the section audit report's follow up required that it is city policy to follow up on audit reports by the city auditor. And folks might argue, well, we can we can find other funds to follow up on audit reports by the city'",
        "'speaker_1': 'auditor. I just want to note that the move levy goes through 2024. The Council won't have the opportunity to discuss Levy funding until that time. And so our options for dedicated transportation funding to address maintenance on our critical bridges is very limited.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The 2015 Move It Move Levy was set up a little differently than the previous Bridging the Gap levy, and the previous levy dedicated a higher proportion of funds to maintenance than the move levy does. So again, the MOVE Levy started moving in a direction away from maintaining critical infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we're going to move towards maintaining critical transportation infrastructure that is multimodal transportation infrastructure, we are not going to have the opportunity to do so for some time. The mayor, as we all know, has chosen to proceed with the repair for the West Seattle Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wholeheartedly agree with this decision, in part due to significantly lower capital costs and the time it required to to build a new bridge. The ongoing maintenance costs will be higher for the West Seattle Bridge. And so this is going to be an issue that I am going to be continuing to weigh in on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, again, as I said, just just to keep things interesting here, I'm going to actually vote consistently with my my committee vote and not support this legislation. Thank you. Councilmember Mosqueda. And is there anyone else who wanted to make any comments on Kaspersky to please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much council members. And I'm always nervous when people want to keep things interesting and appreciate the comments that were made. But I did just want to write and say for the record earlier in my comments about the support from the building construction trades.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I wanted to thank the ironworkers. They sent a letter in that said the iron workers support the budget for bridge maintenance being proposed by Councilmember Peterson. But we also understand the need for community oversight group. We feel it should be made up of labor and community stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're excited to have a seat at the table and looking forward to working with you. That's the piece I wanted to read. And for the record and again, thank our friends in the building trades and make sure that that comment got recorded for the record.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much for those comments and that conversation. We had a really protracted conversation about the amendment that led to this final council bill in Budget Committee. So I don't want to belabor the point. I do want to thank the original sponsors, Councilmembers Peterson, Lewis and Herbold, for bringing forward the legislation to authorize a 40 million'",
        "'speaker_1': 'vehicle license fee. There has been some comments in committee that this is an increase in the license fee. It's actually a decrease in the vehicle license fee. Folks, through the end of the year will be paying $80 in their vehicle license fee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And starting in 2021, that will be reduced to a total of $40. So this is not an increase in in the vehicle license fee. And I wanted to make sure that the record was correct with regard to to that particular issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Secondly, I and I continue to to hear and understand and appreciate Councilmember Herbals comments and concerns around the the question about the stakeholder process and and its relevance to future policy decisions by the City Council in short order related to how we're going to spend that the dollars and I remain committed to making sure that we have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the benefit of that stakeholder information. But of course, at the end of the day, it's always up to the City Council to make budget appropriation authorities within and within our charter mandated duties. So again, there will be recommendations but not mandates coming out of the stakeholder group.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think we will benefit from having the stakeholder group come together and take a look at best use of these dollars. I recognize that the vehicle license fee in the past has been largely dedicated to transit purposes and not to bridge maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we have a new set of information before us that does provide us with additional information around the need to take care of our bridges as sort of a basic part of our infrastructure that connects busses and cyclists and pedestrians and single agency vehicle users throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's important for us to take that into consideration. So so I hope we will be able to have that abbreviated stakeholder process that will yield us some really rich information and recommendations that we can consider in our deliberations as we look towards shaping a spending plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also want to acknowledge that there that Councilmember Hubbard, you've mentioned that some city resources related to constant revenue streams or consistent revenue streams for bridge maintenance. And I also just just think we'd be remiss in not acknowledging that we also have some great members of our congressional delegation, for example, who have been championing additional funding at'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the federal level for bridge maintenance needs, especially the West Seattle Bridge. So I want to thank Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal from our congressional district here in particular, who just last week was able to secure some additional funding for the West Seattle Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that there are going to be, I hope now with the new administration, more opportunities for us to work closely with our federal delegation, to continue to advocate for federal dollars for for this this particular need in in sort of a long term strategy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think there's a lot of work that we can do here. The vehicle license fee gets us about $7.2 million a year. Our needs related to bridges is a total of $100 million. So we certainly need a lot more resources available to to really meet the minimal need, which I understand the city auditor identified as about'",
        "'speaker_1': '$34 million. So I think we're all committed to to figuring this out into making sure that we can balance all of the varying needs related to our infrastructure and our transit network. So I appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with all of you on those important issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Well, I think I don't see any additional comments here. So we're going to go ahead and close that debate. And I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the Bill Morales.'",

There's more humane ways, a holistic ways to help make sure that people have the services they need.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'and we're doing major investments and making sure that our buildings are energy efficient. This is what it looks like to make sure that our values as a council are represented in a city budget. And we've made tremendous changes to the proposed budget that came down.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And you all have done that in partnership with the community. We've helped shrink areas where we knew those services could be better served in Health and Human Services in a stand alone department or in community investments. You all have made those reductions possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We set out to invest in community alternatives. We're investing. It is historic amount in direct community strategies through the participatory budgeting process, through the task force, by making sure that the 10 million that we committed to earlier this year gets directly on to communities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, 12 million, actually. You've all made that possible. And the third thing is, we now have also committed to making sure that we're not growing the size of the police department, as we also seek to increase the size and capacity of our community partners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've helped to make sure that we're scaling up community based programs and services, community based alternatives to addressing harm and making sure that there's a restorative justice pilot program programing for black girls and young women and black queer and trans youth.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'We have lifted up all of so many investments and all of them. I'll summarize on some of those pieces. We'll talk about the ways in which we've scaled up our our firefighter department by making sure that they have trauma informed counseling, because we know that this year has been tremendously hard and that they have the support that'",

The budget includes unprecedented investments in alternatives to policing and reductions in the police department budget.'",

This is a major step forward in the city's ability to reimagine policing and deliver city services that meets the needs of all of the community.

We restored funding for the Green New Deal Oversight Board and the $30 million Anti Displacement Fund, both unfulfilled promises from Mayor Durkan.'",

Millions of dollars for three new dining halls, villages and funding for Nicole. Small and share meals, self-managed villages and funds for 24 hour homeless shelters.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'color in the middle of a pandemic and a spike in COVID infections in the context of the worst recession for working people since the Great Depression. Democratic Council members will be carrying out brutal austerity. It is true that the city council's budget reduces slightly the size of the cuts proposed in Mayor Durkin's budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But still, the Council is allowing almost $200 million to be cut from affordable housing, bus hours, parks and libraries. Funding for affordable housing has been cut from 131 million in 2020 to only $84 million in 2021, a cut of over a third to affordable housing while homelessness balloons out of control across the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Funding for transportation has been cut by almost $100 million. Those cuts include millions more busses and tens of millions for essential maintenance and construction of our transportation infrastructure. And starting in April, the grocery voucher program that thousands of families have relied on will expire.'",

Amazon alone has made $11.5 billion Billion with a B dollars in profits just since April.

        "'speaker_4': 'crisis on ordinary people. Democratic Council members have shockingly claimed that this is an anti austerity budget, but that is simply a lie. The City Council's current proposed budget does reduce slightly the size of the vicious cuts proposed in Mel Dawkins budget.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'On the other hand, the introduction to the mayor's proposed budget says, quote, spending reductions were necessary and quote, and this is how big business and the political establishment has always approached recessions. You will catch them either engaging in obfuscation and simply pretending that the budget cuts don't exist, or claiming that there is no alternative to draconian cuts'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to public infrastructure and essential services while the biggest corporations continue to absorb record profits. Part of my job as an elected representative of working people and as a Socialist City Council member is to expose the lies of the political establishment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you can see, the claim that this is an anti austerity budget is the latest such blatant falsehood. It is true that the Council's budget amendments, which I have supported, have prevented the budgetary layoffs of City of Seattle workers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that is only because the overwhelming majority of the budget cuts differ or eliminate public works like construction and maintenance projects that the city contracts out to be done by workers who are not directly employed by the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Even a simple back of the envelope calculation shows clearly that these cuts will result in hundreds of layoffs and cancel job creation, if not more, which in turn will deepen the recession.

We should be expanding the Green New Deal jobs program, not cutting infrastructure maintenance, as our movement has said.

        "'speaker_4': 'power to hold the police accountable. Every single Democrat voted against accountability. This is the eighth time I am voting on Seattle City budget and never before have there been more lessons for the activists and organizers of social movements than have been revealed this year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Throughout history, it has been movements that make progressive change, not the machinations of the political establishment, not electing the smartest technocrats and not the relationships between elected officials. Real change is driven by the balance of power in society as a whole, and particularly the organized forces of the working class prepare to fight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Two years ago I was the only no vote as the council approved the police contract, rolling back accountability and increased funding to the Seattle Police Department by tens of millions. Last year, with just me voting no. All Democrats then passed a special bill to provide hiring bonuses for new police officers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, after the Justice for George Floyd movement, many of the same councilmembers have voted in favor of $31 million reduction in police different police budget. What made the Democrats take even this limited step was the pressure of the movement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Similarly, had it not been for the powerful tax Amazon movement over the summer, there would be an additional $214 million of a hole in the budget in the first half of 2020. The tax Amazon movement mobilized hundreds, perhaps thousands of community activists and organizers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We held mass organizing conferences, which elected a coordinating committee that was held accountable to the rank and file where community members voted democratically on both the policy and the strategy to win. And those volunteers create gathered 30,000 signatures on the tax Amazon ballot initiative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And with the threat of a ballot initiative hanging over the heads of big business and the political establishment, we won this historic legislation. Members of the public may have noticed that I never used the phrase, quote unquote, jumpstart to refer to the Amazon tax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is because that language is designed and approved by big business to try and erase that unprecedented role of the grassroots nostrum on movement from the history of our victory. You can see the. Pictures and videos of the DAX Amazon movement and hundreds participating in mass meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'After mass meeting. There are no pictures of a movement called Jumpstart because there was no such movement. Only a watered down proposal passed under pressure from our movement. And it is essential that we recognize the vital role of the movement in these victories, which otherwise would not have happened.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we, as working people do not, then our future demands will fail. We should recognize and claim every victory our grassroots movements win. And I voted for every progressive budget amendment in this budget. But those victories continue to be on the margins of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'While the majority of the budget is an austerity budget, placing the burden of the COVID emergency, climate, emergency, homelessness, emergency and economic recession onto the shoulders of regular working people rather than big business and the rich. For those reasons, I will be voting no on this brutal austerity budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our movement needs to carry forward serious and sober lessons from this year and come back next year to fight renewed battles for COVID relief and a guaranteed jobs program to cancel rent and mortgages for those affected by COVID.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To defend the Amazon tax against what will be round two of attempts by the Democratic establishment to pass a statewide ban on municipal big business taxes and for an elected community oversight board with full powers to hold the police accountable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to win any of this, we will need movements, and the leadership of the movement will need to be independent of the political establishment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilmember Mosqueda, I think you wanted an opportunity to respond to some of those. Colorful comments. I'm I'm happy to allow for that to happen. I do have three other council members who are in the queue. So if there's no objection, I'm happy to allow that to happen.'",

You know, I just think it's really important that we recognize the work of the folks who really organize to pass the just aren't progressive payroll tax. I recognized when we did this this summer the movement of the tax Amazon folks and the gears that folks have been talking about this, no question'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Well, let's remember the entire coalition that came together around Jumpstart that included communities of color, that included workers of color, that included small businesses. This is important to remember because it is absolutely false. It is a lie to say that anything related to Jumpstart was drafted by big business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not true.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just want to make sure that that's abundantly clear, that we have integrity as we talk about it, and that we recognize that this was people coming together to build on years of advocacy that I have also acknowledged.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we passed something collectively as a council that did bring in the 214 million. And we did this with a broad coalition that helped come up with not just the name, but the entire proposal. And I'm incredibly proud of that.'",

The folks who fought for environmental protections and homelessness services. All of the pieces that we got in there is a really, really robust effort.'",

Colleagues, I am really proud to see this budget before us, including my my priorities for food access, tenant protections, addressing homelessness, addressing climate crisis and investing in trees and in increasing our access to transit as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to start off by saying I wasn't going to mention this, but I am really glad that we have limited the lay off of city employees expanding housing, food and economic stimulus to Seattle residents. The council's budget prevents us against austerity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Budgeting, restorations and investments are included in this budget to stop cuts to government services and public sector workers who provide those services. Every budgetary layoff that was planned in the proposed budget has been replenished so that we ensure that the core services in critical areas, especially to our most vulnerable in times of crisis, are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are invested in that. We continue those core government services in critical areas. The council's budget takes this anti-austerity approach. It builds back on all of the proposed cuts and it even builds back the reserves to around the Great Recession emergency reserve levels.'",

Proud and stand by them. Regarding regarding food access, I'm really glad that this budget has invested in the FreshBooks program.'",

I believe the amended budget has both positives and negatives, and I believe it's important for my constituents that I acknowledge both.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First, some of the concerns. I'm concerned this budget shortchanges average infrastructure. I don't think it fully revamps public safety with a plan. I don't feel like we have enough accountability for our response to homelessness. And I'm concerned that we're giving city government a pay raise, a pay increase, instead of investing more in our most marginalized communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But this budget benefits every district, including District four. And the budget process was fair, thanks to the diplomacy of our Budget Committee chair. No budget is perfect. Our constituents have diverse and conflicting views. A budget with both positives and negatives is a natural result.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm not going to belabor those points. I do want to say thank you to Chair Mosquito for a very difficult job here. I think when she was talking to me as a future council president and advocating for an opportunity to be the the budget chair, I don't think she did that advocacy in the context of realizing'",
