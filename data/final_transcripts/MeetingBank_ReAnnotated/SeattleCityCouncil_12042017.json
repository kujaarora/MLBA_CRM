We have relied on their expertize, their professional integrity, their financial analysis, market conditions, and all the difficulties of Reimagining Seattle Center. And let me tell you, folks, it was no easy task.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also want to thank before I think my colleagues in particular and I need to read this list off because it's important. I've been living and breathing these and with these individuals in these groups for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think what the public doesn't know behind the scenes is who these people are that actually roll up their sleeves, get out the spreadsheets, make us go through our exercise, ask all of our questions, and provide the document and do the due diligence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ben Noble from the from the city budget office. Ben, thank you so much. Greg Nava legal. His analysis and superb legal advice has been phenomenal in Greg's. Try on a chair. I can see him sitting right there. Just in case we need him.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to thank the staff from DCI Nathan Torkelson, or PKD, Sam Safir. Asafa Escort Scott Scooby. I would say that Scooby. I call him Scooby. That's why I'm saying that. And departure of neighborhoods, Kathleen Island. All of them provided essential feedback on the EMU particular thanks to council member Bagshaw and her staff, Lily and Alberta.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so much. Working with my staff, it really was helpful obviously. And of course, Council Member Herrell. I want to thank Vin for the work that he did. A particular shout out to my staff. Ms.. Mercedes Elizalde.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There she is in the back. Mercedes and I would have been attached to this for 13, 14 months, weekends, nights. This woman works the floor, gets the amendments, does the research. Another really big thank you. And I hope she's watching Shayna.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We hired Shayna in Sept in January and her only job was to do all the research at the archives down here in Seattle, in City Hall and at the University of Washington. She pulled up all the op ed pieces, the original legislation, the ordinances, the letters from Congress to state, the city from the 1958 to 1962 for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the World's Fair, because it was important for us to see the long term vision of what our civic leaders were thinking about in 1950 859. And believe me, that actually shaped a lot of our opinion about the isn't just about bringing back the Sonics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's about a regional asset. And as I want to quote, Maggie, if some of you remember whoever Senator McGee was called, Seattle Center in the World's Fair and the Space Needle in the footprint, a jewel, the jewel of our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's what we led with. We have two phenomenal groups. I'm going to duplicate a few names because they do show up a few times, but they had been phenomenal. The two groups that we work with their guidance, their comments, their assistance, their perseverance, their negotiating first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first community group, Deborah Fastow from Uptown Alliance, Ali Garrett from Tabor 100. Nicole Grant, thank you very much. From Labor. Todd Humphrey. Megan Jasper. Jan Levy. Jill Nishi. The bill said this. Ron Rico, Quantum Drago. Ethan Stoll.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lenny Wilkins. Councilmember back and I had an opportunity to have lunch with the famous Mr. Wilkins and learned a lot about history and wisdom and what a team means. But not just the team, the whole spirit of the city coming together, and also his phenomenal support, of course, for Seattle Storm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second group has been and will continue to lead the community involvement process in the execution of this development. Their guiding principles are an attachment to to the legislation. I want to thank Monte Anderson, John Barr, Robert Cardona, Andrea Capone, Evan Clifford, Brian Curry, Deborah Foster again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Allie Grant again. Nicole Grant again Michael McQuaid, Brian Robertson, Sarah Wilkie and Jane Slutsky. I could actually give you a lot more names and people in groups, but I won't. We could be here all for another 3 hours if I did that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I do want to add one more thing before I finish. I want to thank the Seattle storm. In the letter, I had a chance to exchange some messages with Jenny. And thank you for the little lady that was here that read this yellow storm letter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the thing that was I found the most most poignant in her letter when it comes to the Seattle storm, because people always just talk about the Sonics. Even though they left us in their letter, they said something to me that really spoke to me about having a new arena and thanking us and being supportive because'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that they deserve to work and play basketball in an upgraded arena where the technology is state of the art, and where we have a building that keeps out the rain when we don't give consideration to other kind of sports, when it's only about male sports, we don't look at the other type of people that contribute to the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'city. In sports, I think you're missing out. And I also want to thank Seattle Storm because they have worked with us on the relocation efforts and also mitigating the franchise losses for those two years and have been very, very open and honest and good about how we can all work together to move them and take care of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'them while we go through this. If this gets past today, this change, I want to thank my council colleagues for their input throughout the process. Those of you who provided me in input, your comments, your drafts, your concerns during the RFP phase and our letter to the Executive in June and throughout the review process to identify the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'needed amendments to the menu, including the August resolution that passed unanimously, where we were very clear in our intent and resolve to build a world class arena for not only the city of Seattle, but for everyone in the state of Washington.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is such an amazing opportunity. Such an investment of this magnitude into the call center has not been seen since the days before the World's Fair in 1962. We see now how this is igniting a new age of female led sports with the young.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Women of Washington Wild. That's the girls hockey team who consistently came to public comment to support this project. And as and as I shared our discussions with Seattle Storm today. If council votes to approve this MSU it it'll be the first step of many more to come over the next year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council will be viewing several documents, as I shared before the development agreement, the lease agreement, the SEAL Integration Agreement, the EGIS, the Transportation Mobility Action Plan, the Community Benefits Agreement. With more work to come, I look forward to groundbreaking and grand opening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I should add that working with OPG has been a pleasure. I've been a lawyer for 31 years and I've built many things and negotiated many things. I am proud that OPG gave $20 million to our community fund, that OPG agreed to MJ, that they gave 1% for the arts, that they of the 20,000,010 will go to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'youth care, that OPG has agreed to relocate and paid for the skate the skate park. And I could go on and on. But all of that is within the is within the ordinance and it's within the 50 page menu, which I think has seven attachments, if I'm correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so let me just end on this note. We work really hard on this. We made sure, I made sure Mercedes made sure, Councilor Bagshaw made sure President Harrell made sure that my colleagues not only had the benefit of all the material briefings, private briefings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We even went as far to make each council member a notebook. I was ready to just show up at their house on a Saturday and go through it again. And I'll tell you why not. Because I'm in the pocket of big business or corporation or the NHL.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's because I believe in this. And this, I believe, is the best thing for the city of Seattle, whoever you cheer for. But more importantly, what I am really proud of are the seven objectives that we hammered out that is in the menu, that it's a world class arena at little or no cost to the taxpayers, and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it embodies all the values of Seattle. So with that, I hope today that the MQ passes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Well done, Casper. And worse. I had to cancel our.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you to Councilmember Warrens for making note of the commitments in this agreement related to Labor. I wanted to just give a little bit of specific detail about those commitments. Not only are we going to ensure that the worker retention rates of of workers at the key arena now are observed, but that we are also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'going to see inclusive proposals for labor peace agreements. But also really importantly is the adherence of this project to priority hire. Last year the mayor issued an executive order saying that we should seek to ensure that public private partnerships also adhere to priority hire.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is not the law right now. That is something that we seek to do, but it's something that is enshrined in this particular MRU and I think that is a really good model for the city. This may be one of the biggest projects in the pipeline with the capacity to secure a career ladder, opportunities benefiting large numbers'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of Seattle workers. I also wanted to give a nod to the the arts issues that this agreement addresses. And thank you, Councilmember Suarez, for shepherding those issues, specifically ensuring that Pottery Northwest is is treated fairly in their relocation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I look forward in the future to seeing a definition on what relocation costs include, particularly concern about the compensation of revenue that's lost during this transition. Also very appreciative of the commitments in this agreement to work collaboratively with the arts tenants in ensuring that what is now a theater district can can also coexist peacefully and thrive with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with these arts uses. And then finally, really appreciate how this agreement makes commitments to work with each Viera, Cerf and Kxip on the development of a future outdoor concert site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Kathryn Herbold. I think I had Kathryn Mesquita and I think Councilmember O'Brien reaching for the mic. So it was like Councilmember O'Brien to go first or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have an amendment and so I can put it out there. But if you wanted to speak before that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why don't we go catch him skate and then catch from Brian Cashman, a skater. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, thank you so much. Thank you to my colleagues and I'm so excited. I jumped for the mic. I apologize for jumping in a rhythm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rhythm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to say a huge amount of appreciation for all of the work that went into this. Especially to Councilmember Suarez, Councilmember Bagshaw and President Harrell also for the incredible work that a Councilmember Herbal just outlined in terms of labor protections.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will be voting yes for this provision today. And yes. And in terms of the effort to create not just a sports arena, but a thriving arts and cultural campus for our community. This is truly, I think, a win for our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that there's strong financial protections. I think that there are strong protections for those who are working on this project to continue to engage with our community organizations and with our neighborhood associations and to make sure that there's strong worker protections.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm incredibly honored to be able to work side by side with those in the labor community who have been working on this. Executive Secretary Nicole Grant is here along with the broader labor community who I know has been working on this to make sure that there is not just strong, good union jobs, but that there is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'labor peace agreements, that we have efforts that will hire locally and that will hire people of color and those who are in most need of jobs that are good living wage jobs and strong protections, strong union protections. I think that there's many things that the city has done to learn from your example when you work to transition'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the zoo and transition the aquarium to make sure that we had protections for the workers who were there. And I know we can learn from those experiences to make sure that we maintain good living wage jobs and that we keep workers whole in the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so when the arena reopens up and I know it's going to be an expedited timeline, thanks to the commitment from this council and of the commitment from all of you, I know that we're going to be able to have good living wage jobs while we construct and then when we're done constructing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I applaud all the parties that were involved in this process. I think that the strong financial protections and sideboards are incredible. And from my perspective, this is level setting. When you think about how arenas will be built in other cities around the country, this sets the stage for holding developers accountable, making sure that labor protections'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are included, and that the community view and the community lens is included from the beginning. So thank you for all your work on that. And there's so many things I want to say just about the tenants that are going to be there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm excited about protecting those who are involved in our arts and culture and those who are also involved in growing the next generation of our sports community. And yes, it's bringing back the Sonics. Yes, it's making sure that we can have a hockey league, but it's also making sure that those who are there right now with the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'storm and with the Washington Female Hockey Association continue to have a strong place to thrive and grow and to grow. Our next generation, I talked to the folks at the skate Like a Girl this morning, and I look forward to working with you and working with them to make sure that there is a place that's equitable and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'accessible for these young women to make sure that they have a place to play, both structured play and non structure plays. I think what we're investing in in the arena. So I'm definitely interested in hearing more about ways that we continue to improve this process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you heard, this is step one, and I think that we're going to be continuing to look to make sure we're good stewards of the public dollar, that we're mitigating for impact on transit and transportation, and that we're lifting up our industries and making sure that our workers are invested in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so to that end, I'm looking forward to working with you. Let's get this built. It's good for our city. It's good for jobs. It's good for a thriving Seattle. And I'm so proud of the work that you all have done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember Skater. Okay, a little pivot on hearing from colleagues. Councilmember Swan, I believe you have some comments you'd like to make.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Brandon Harrell. I agree with Councilmember Suarez on her comments about the hard work that has been put into this legislation from central staff. And I know councilmember was specifically mentioned, goes nose down and done it. I really wanted to second that that that a lot of hard work has gone into it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also agree with Councilmember Waters that she herself made her office very available to all council officers. So I think that there has been you know, in my mind, there is no there's no cause for complaint on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I do have some critical comments to make. So I just wanted to make sure that everybody understand that my critical comments reflect political differences, not in any way of failing to communicate, because I think that was done in a in in a very full manner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, the political substance of legislation matters is not merely about hard work. I do intend to vote yes on this, Emmylou, because. I think that on the balance, it is better for the city than nothing. However, I also want to be clear that whether or not one thinks this is a great deal, as many for the city'",
        "'speaker_4': ', as many have said, that's a subjective assessment. It is based on what standard you want to hold the city to. So in my view, it is a total exaggeration to say that this is the best possible deal and a great deal and so on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I will explain my comments. First of all, for some reasons why I will be voting yes. I am glad that this AMAJU has managed to win the support of workers and the labor unions that represent them. As you know, the concerns raised by the dockworkers and other unions about the SODO arena were decisive in my decision'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to vote against that in the past. And the support of trade unions is an important part of my yes vote today. As a member of the labor movement myself, that is important to me. I am also glad that the city will ultimately avoid losing revenue in this milieu.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city has vital things to invest its limited funds on housing, addressing homelessness, equitable development and other vital services. And I really would appeal to the labor movement to show as much presence and activism as they have shown on aspects like the Arena project to also for them to show that on housing and homelessness issues, these are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'important issues. These are issues that are important for workers. These are, in my view, issues for the labor movement. So I look forward to seeing as much or more presence of labor on those issues and not just on the arena.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Finally, I'm glad that there is the opportunity to possibly bring Seattle a men's basketball team in addition to the storm, and maybe to bring Seattle a hockey team. I know things were better with Sonics fans when we voted no against it, and at that time I said, I'm not against sports.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm very pro sports. Although I would not be surprised if the NBA strings Seattle along for years and uses the prospect of moving a team to Key Arena as a threat to extract concessions from other cities. And in general, as I've said before, I think it is an outrage that professional sports league dominated by billionaires, are allowed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to operate as legal cartels that can deny entire cities the opportunity to have a team. I also want to be clear that even though this Emmylou is better than nothing, in my view, is far from a great deal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city is agreeing to give ovg a massive and that's and capital letters massive tax break for decades as business in key arena increases over the next decades, the city is agreeing to give back half of all the increased tax revenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is only half of the increase and not half of all their taxes. So again, mathematically speaking, the city will not be losing money. From the city standpoint, it will not be losing money, will not be negative. But we also need to be clear as a whole, this is a massive tax break that cities would never give'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to ordinary citizens like you and me. When was the last time you or I got that kind of tax break? And keep in mind, this is in the context of Washington having the most regressive tax system in the nation, because OPG is a very large business and has lots of money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is how big business operates. They are they have the power to leverage that money, that wealth, and they are doing so. They are leveraging that money to extract from the city tax breaks. And this sort of thing happens at every level of our government.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is part of a system where wealth is equal to power, and that power is used to shift even more money towards the wealthy. We are seeing that same thing happening at the federal level. And by the way, the Sodo arena, NYU, you also contained massive tax break for big business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Imagine if governments would make deals with the regular workers, giving us back half our taxes when we get raises. This is another example of how unequal our society is. So I will be clear. I will be voting yes in favor of this, Emmylou, because it does benefit the city as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I will not be calling it a great deal for the city because it's not regular people. But OPG has big business that is poised to reap the huge profits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember should. What thank you very much comes from Brian. You have the floor, sir.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So I have an amendment that you all should have in front of you. It would amend Council Bill 119088, attachment one, Section one B under the section term and exclusivity by deleting the last sentence clause which reads and to the city, shall not provide financial support, benefits or incentives open parentheses other than those that are'",
        "'speaker_6': 'generally available to any potential developer. Close parentheses with respect to the construction of any live entertainment venue with a capacity of more than 15,000 seats within the jurisdictional jurisdictional boundaries of the city of Seattle. See if there's a second for that amendment, and then I can speak to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Calling for a second chance. Memories to watch your brother hang in there. So, okay, we have a motion on the second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the principles for me when we started this conversation over a year ago was specifically around exclusivity and open to the idea of an agreement with OPG or anybody else that wanted to contribute to an arena remodel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it was important to me that we not give them an exclusive deal. This section, at least my read of it, talks about, has about exclusivity, has two parts. The first says that the city shall not negotiate with any person or entity other than ovg, or it's designing or permitted signing regarding renovation or redevelopment of the arena'",
        "'speaker_6': ', or solicit or entertain bids or proposals to do so. Now that makes sense to me as we're working on an agreement for that arena, that they would be the only ones that would do the work in the arena.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But to extend that exclusivity for not just the term of the menu, but also the term of the entire lease agreement, that we wouldn't make any deals with anyone else in the city for arenas. Over 15,000 seats, I think ties our hands in a way and becomes problematic for me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One example is certainly the obvious one, which is around the SODO arena. And what kind of deals would we enter into there? What concerns me more is the reality that we're facing with this agreement in regards to a potential monopoly of large music venues by Live Nation in our market.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've heard a lot from folks in the music industry that have concerns about the monopoly of the music industry by a couple of players in in our city, Live Nation. If this goes forward, we control the arena and we control White River Amphitheater, which is a venue that I think seats about 16,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the music venue at the Gorge, which seats about 27,000, holds about 27,000 folks. The major music venues in town will be controlled by one and one entity. And I think that is a big problem, big problem for the citizens of Seattle, and I think a big problem for folks, especially in the music industry, to have to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'go through the single player. Now, there's no proposal to build major another major music venue in Seattle right now. And I want to be clear that if someone came up with a proposal to do something else for music or other entertainment that the tax credits we're giving away, I wouldn't want to give away lately, but I would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'want to retain the flexibility to enter into agreements like this. If someone over the course of the next 44 years decides that they wanted to do so, make an investment like this, I guess I'll leave it at that and see if there are any questions or comments on the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very good, I'm sure to generate a few comments. Thank you, Councilmember Brian, for stating it very clearly. Councilmember, where is it you want to respond?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien, for your comments. I do have five points I want to make about the exclusivity clause, starting with the fact that as a lawyer for 31 years, building casinos and hotels and hospitals and police stations and golf courses, this is a common term.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a common agreement. It's a common restriction. It doesn't tie our hands. It actually protects us. On November 16th, 18 days ago, this exact amendment was in front of us and this committee unanimously denied it. Indeed, they we voted five zero that we would not change it with the same comments and concerns in exchange.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I bring it up now. Today, nothing has changed. And we have the exact same amendment in front of us. This amendment, the exclusivity term, I'm sorry, has no impact on any street vacation or the Soto Street vacation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This does not bar any group from seeking a street vacation. Like I said, this provision protects us and I guess the common sense responses. Why would we not have one? Why would we allow another arena or venue to be built that would compete against us?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are if we sign and go forward with this milieu with with ovg, it isn't them versus us. If Ovg makes money, we make money. At the end of the day, it isn't $650 million that Ovg is putting into this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It comes out to 1.2 billion. So again, I'm hoping and I. Customer Brian, thank you for talking with me this morning. It isn't just that I've been working on this for 13 months. I did this for a living for many years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I just want to reiterate that at some point as chair of this committee, that I would be given some deference, some understanding that I know what I'm talking about, and I would not have agreed to it if I didn't believe it is a it's an important and it's a critical component in an MCU to have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'an exclusivity clause. It's like when you put in an. Non-compete clause or non-disclosure agreement. It isn't there to take away or tie the hands of any type of sports or economic development. It merely says that not only are we obviously protecting their interests, but they're protecting our financial interest as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Remember, if a business comes in and puts $1.3 billion into a project, they expect to make that money back, as well as making sure that we have a revenue stream. And we also come out in the in the in the black on this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that, I will leave it at that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember Bagshaw.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilmember O'Brien, I'm not going to support this for three reasons. And the first of which is that we had this in front of us just two weeks ago and we voted it down. And I haven't talked with you about this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Haven't seen any reason why we would reconsider it. The second reason is I'm not clear why you would want to eliminate this clause, because what you would effectively do is to allow special financial support and benefits to go to another private developer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not sure what you have in mind there, but it's certainly not something I want to support. And lastly, just procedurally, and I know this is something that we have brought up. We have repeatedly asked if there is an amendment, would you tell us beforehand?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I went to office last week and I asked everybody, is there a concern? Do you have anything that you want to bring up? We heard nothing from you until 1138 this morning. And I just have to say that we are trying to bring some discipline and frankly, some cordiality among our colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just don't think that's right. And I'm not going to support this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before a council member responds. They seem reaching for the mic. In fairness, accounts from Brian, at least in my conversations with him, he has during a very complex budget time, he made it very clear that he was under-resourced and he was struggling with having a good, strong, comprehensive understanding of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we've had many conversations. And again, in fairness to Councilmember Brian, he did comply with the time deadlines to get this within 2 hours of the deadline in order to get it on the docket. I'm not supporting the amendment as well for different reasons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perhaps not that I have disagreed with the criticisms that I've heard. But my concern is, number one, I actually appreciate him bringing the issue up that if we are either consciously or unconsciously creating a monopoly for a company like Live Nation in the entertainment venue, that that's always monopolies do not work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is a restraint of trade. And there's all kinds of issues that come along with that. The language in the existing exhibit that I am comfortable with says that we would give financial support, benefits or incentives. It says.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Other than those that are generally available to any potential developer. So in other words, we will deal with developers as we deal with developers and negotiate with them on what it takes to negotiate an arrangement. But make no mistake about this, that we are dealing with a private entity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They have a rate of return that they are trying to achieve. We have a rate of return we are trying to achieve. And I thought they were they are well within their rights to ask for this kind of exclusivity language, which I understand from the experts that we've hired, that this is nothing to be alarmed about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, this is sort of I don't say standard language, but this is not something that should hurt us in the long run. But I think his policy points are actually the least well-received by me that we need to concern ourselves with whether we are creating some kind of monopoly and whether that is good policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my bottom line is I'm still comfortable with the language, and I think that this does not prohibit us from talking to developers, from talking to the Soto group and having discussions as they arise. But but this is actually solid language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember O'Brien, you you have the I know you have a response you'd like to make. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's let's go to Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Brown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm really sympathetic with the motivation for this amendment. I myself had developed amendment last week, and that gets to some of the issues here. I took a different approach than Councilmember O'Brien took and maintained the exclusivity clause and upped the capacity, because I don't actually see this as this let this language itself creating a monopoly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'except for venues that are of a certain size. And so I was interested in increasing the number of seats to 20,000 seat venues. But I was told I couldn't bring that amendment forward. And I had intended, if I could bring it forward, I intended to make sure that we checked with Ovg to see whether or not that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'was an amendment that was amenable. Because I'm sensitive to the fact that there are negotiations that have been going on as we have been making changes here on this council. And I wouldn't want to make a change that was was basically non-negotiable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's that's right where I am right now with this particular amendment as as drafted. I don't know how it would be received by our partner. And that that concerns me. I again, I don't think that the exclusivity clause as it is drafted actually does create a a monopoly for 1a1 set of interests.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it does allow for a development of another facility, another large facility. But I do have questions of whether or not it is the size facility that our music community is seeking. So that that's sort of where my question is simply striking out the clause altogether.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just I have concerns about the impact on on the agreement with our partner on this by by doing so. If I had more information, I might feel differently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Herbert. Councilmember O'Brien, would you like to make any comments or any customers want as a comment? I would select.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One. I do wrap up because I can address some of the concerns. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you're going to wrap up, so cuts from what you like some comments. This is on the amendment, I take it? Yeah. Thank you. We have a live amendment that's been moved in second.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So first I want to be clear. I mean, as a socialist, I'm totally opposed to using public money to subsidize private arenas or big business in general. That goes without saying. However, I think we should also be very clear that Oleg's motivation in seeking this exclusivity clause is not in any way common with me as a socialist'",
        "'speaker_4': '. They are asking for this exclusivity clause because they want a guarantee of a monopoly on this sort of space as a business for sporting and for arena sized concerts. I am against subsidizing big business. But. But I'm also against giving a contract to any one big business that gives them the power over what sort of contract a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city can do in the future for the next 55 years. For example, over the past few years, the city has lost a lot of revenue opportunities because it gave empty exclusive rights to all alcohol sales in all of Seattle center for decades.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OPG is, of course, well within their legal rights to ask for this clause. The city is well within its rights to refuse this clause. And I think we also have to point out there is an insidious component to all of this, which is the false equivalency between big business and whose interests the city should be representing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's like saying, Well, OPG is one entity, the city is one entity. There all is that all an equal playing field? It's merely a business negotiation that is extremely misleading. This is a city, a country and a world that is deeply unequal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in my view, the city of Seattle should be hugely prioritizing the interests of regular people, not big business. This is not an equal playing field in any way. This is reminiscent to me of the letter that most of this council and many other elected officials wrote to Amazon, apologizing to them that maybe they felt unwelcome.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we have to be very clear which side we should be on. It is not a new, politically neutral territory. I will be voting yes on this amendment because I do not support giving OPG a veto on the city's future decisions for the next half century.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, the city should have the right and it should be principled enough to say that public money will not be used to subsidize big business. But we don't need already to do that and already. So it only should not have any power over the city's decisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember Swann, I believe Councilman Brown is going to wrap up on the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I may try to touch on a couple of the concerns my colleagues raised. I'll go in chronological order, as I recall. Councilmember Juarez, I appreciate you highlighting the history here and highlighting specifically the concern that the city would not want to do anything that would undermine itself going forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I agree that any agreement to partner with a new arena proposal anywhere else in the city would be one we want to take lightly. We would want to consider the impacts on our existing investment at Key Arena, but I do think we would want to have the flexibility to make the decision at that time about what's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the best interest of the city of Seattle. And I worry that this exclusivity clause would tie our hands and not allow us that ability if an opportunity came forward at some point in the next, you know, 40 plus years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Customer base, I apologize for not meeting your timeline. I do always try to be as upfront with folks on this. Unfortunately, because of the commitment I had made almost a year ago, I was unable to be at the committee meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, it was scheduled after I had made that commitment on November 16th. I was under the impression that there was going to possibly be another committee meeting on November 27th, which I was able to attend. But that meeting got canceled.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so my only opportunity to bring an amendment forward where I could actually speak to it myself and make my case was today. And so, so here I am. I can kind of see where the votes are. So I recognize what's going to happen there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also, Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate your different approach. I do firmly believe that this isn't the type of agreement where we go to the other party and ask if it's okay. I think we have a bottom line to and we can say no, this is a non-negotiable thing for us, which for me, this one is which is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'why I want to put this language in now. And if OPG says, well, we cannot proceed at this point with that and it's a deal breaker, then you know, we can have that conversation. But I don't think I need to ask their permission for changes that I think here in the best interests of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Finally, Council President Harrell, I really appreciate your comments there. And when I do read this language, it's it's vague and I'll speak to that and. I think there's it could mean different things to different people, but I'll speak to that after we take the vote on the amendment and talk about the final bill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, very good. So we have an amendment that is basically stated by Council, Brian, to delete the term and exclusivity language at the end. I think we all got a grasp on that. So I'm just going to ask for a not only a voice vote, but raise your hand as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's been moved. And Second Councilmember O'Brien's amendment's been moved. And second and all those in favor of his amendment, please vote yes and raise your hand.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All of the polls say no and raise your hand. Oh, no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the amendment fails. So so now we have the still is an amended legislation because Councilmember Juarez had made a substitution. So we're we now have the Bass legislation. So we will I don't need a motion for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I could just do a roll call when it's time to to vote. Yeah, we'll move it in a minute. So, you know, I want to make sure everyone has said what they want to say before we vote. So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council Member Yes, we're on the Bass. Council Member Back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I'm very optimistic today that we are making way to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in an asset that is one of the most prominent assets we have in our city and certainly historically relevant. And I know we've heard some comments about what the city is giving up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're also getting $600 million that is invested in an asset that needs some love. And let's just be frank and I do want to acknowledge the work. I mean, Mercedes in the background has been the understated person and Kushner aerostat Ben Noble in the back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But Councilmember Suarez you have done an amazing job of bringing us through this and with Council President Harrell, this has been no small feat and we have been working on lots of things through the budget. But you laid out a plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You worked on the RFP. We got proposals. You helped identify the pros and cons of all of those. We worked through the summer. You worked all the way through the fall on this. I do not want to understate how important it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that said, we've acknowledged Brian Surratt, who's still hiding in the back. Robert Nelms, I don't know if Robert is here. Thank you. That's Master Robert's Robert Nelms, but also our friends from uptown. I see that Debbie Fastow is back there and Cooper was here earlier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that. Mike McQuade, thank you so much. On our Belltown friends, it has mattered so much to have you all here in the port. Stephanie Bowman, thank you. You are a star. Lindsay Wolpert, thank you for putting your positions out there and for also saying that you're going to assist with the transportation, whether it's $5 million'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to help the mobility plan or help us with the monorail, it is going to be a big difference. I also want to acknowledge what the city is getting besides having $600 million that's going to be invested in our neighborhoods and the arena.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's going to be $40 million coming in as a transportation payment. We know that the city will match that and more over the next number of months and years. The baseline rent we have acknowledged. But I really want to say thank you to Tim, Luigi and to Francesca you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And Lance Lopes, thank you for reaching out to our community. It's made such a huge difference because I know that coming in from Los Angeles or New York City, somebody would say, Well, you don't know Seattle well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have worked hard to get to know us, and I'm really respectful of that. And I just want you to know how much I appreciate the work that you've done, and particularly around youth care, our friends from Youth Care, you make such a difference in our community and having some of not only those of you who are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'working at youth care, but some of your students who have been here, it's going to make a big difference. And we all are focusing on how our community can be a better place to live. And I think this is going to really help us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The value to Seattle Center is huge. The work that you're going to be doing, not just in the arena, but helping us with bringing together the tenants in Seattle Center, whether it's Pottery Northwest people have talked about that skate like a girl the storm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry that our storm friends left because sometimes we hear people say, oh, we need to have a world class basketball team, or we got one, and we may very well have another. And one thing I haven't heard said is, do you all realize that this year is the 100th anniversary?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is the 100 year anniversary of the Seattle metropolitans who won the Stanley Cup. So I just want to say thank you. Thank you to those of you from from our good friends, from the hockey teams, because you've been here meeting after meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's been great to see you, not just our friends from the Sonics, but to have our friends from hockey as well. And I want to acknowledge this the sense of the Seattle integration, our school district, many of you know, just a week ago we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Seattle Public Schools doing work not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just on the memorial. And potentially another school asset there. And it makes such a difference to be bringing the community around what we can do. The Mobility Action Plan, Debbie FRAUSTO is here and I can see her smiling and sort of that Jiminy Cricket on my shoulder for the last year is that we have to have a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mobility action plan that moves people to and from Seattle Center that doesn't compromise how people get around in uptown Belltown and South Lake Union. So I just want to acknowledge her and Alan Hart via architects are going to be helping us with that and already mentioned has been the equity for workers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Herbold I know that this has been something so important to you and of course our new Councilmember Mosqueda having labor harmony. The priority hires the apprenticeship programs. This is going to revolutionize how our people are working and both during the time we're constructing and afterwards when we actually have them on site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think the business and economic development in the neighborhood is going to be tremendously impactful. Nicole Grant, are you still here or did she leave? So from. Nicole Grant. Marty Anderson Dale Bridle spoke ILWU. Thank you for being here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also Andrea and Bess from Stagehands. Thank you. I think some of you have already gone, but really appreciate the work that you've done and being here and talking to us about how important this project is to you. So I'm all for this in huge contrast to 18 months ago when there was a lot of sadness in this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'room. I think we're going to see a great deal of support here up on the dais, but also a great support going forward. So many thanks to all of you who have come.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember Bagshaw. Okay, I see Councilmember Johnson, the tallest one up here, getting ready to say a few words. So, Senator Johnson, you have the floor, sir, just briefly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Council President Harrell. You know, when we started on this process, I think one of the things that I really tried to watch out for is the danger of what happens sometimes in public private partnerships. And when they go bad is when the public sector has to take on all the risk and the private sector gets'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to pocket all the profits. And that is not what we have here. This is a true partnership where we are sharing in the risk, but also sharing the reward. I'd like to thank Councilmember Suarez and Brian Serrano and many folks here at the city who made this possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd also like to thank the folks at Oak View for really working hard to be good neighbors and good partners with us. Much has been made of the work around labor harmony and protections for workers, but also the work that we did to make sure that the intentionality of the Seattle Center as an arts and cultural district'",
        "'speaker_7': 'is preserved as part of the growth and redevelopment of ARENA. You know that the OPG group continues to commit to the mandatory housing affordability payments, that they will commit to that $10 million of funding for youth care, as well as an additional $10 million in funding and the $40 million transportation funds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are all really important commitments, I think, about being a good neighbor and understanding the impact that you have on your community. We've set very high expectations for this project and we expect it to deliver. But this is just one of the many opportunities that the council has for reviewing the work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I've asked questions in previous committees and will continue to ask questions about issues like the historic preservation tax credit, which is currently 10% of the argues financial plans as we get into implementation documents. If that tax credit is removed, as it is contemplated right now by the folks in Congress, I'll be looking to our private'",
        "'speaker_7': 'sector partners to how they're going to fill that gap as we get into the environmental impact statements and we talk about what the, you know, Sunday after Thanksgiving, really big transportation impact day of the potential of a basketball hockey game, along with the work of the ballet for a matinee and an evening performance, as well as Black'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nativity and all the other things that happen on Seattle Center on that first Sunday of Thanksgiving. You know, what does that really mean for our transportation mitigation plan and how do we analyze those things through an environmental impact statement?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those are going to be important elements as we move forward. And the implementation documents that I'll be watching for. And Councilmember wise, you alluded to my little bobblehead. So after the last vote, you know, I will confess at six foot three of being one of the shorter of my cousins.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And my little brother played basketball at the University of Washington for a couple of years. And I've had a cousin who played overseas. And when I got to see him and his friends and my cousins, I hear more about the Sonics and hockey than I do just about anything else.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I had a good friend. Give me that bobblehead after the last vote and said, Don't lose the faith. Keep up the work and make sure that you stay committed to bringing professional hockey and professional basketball to the city of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm proud to be here today and taking this vote. And I hope that it is just another step for us in bringing those professional teams back to the city. Councilmember wise, the kids wouldn't let me bring my storm swag with me today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's how important it is to them. So I don't have my little sort of supporting dolls that I hope that I would have. But Hannah was having too much fun playing with that on the bus this morning, and I couldn't part with that four year old's commitment to her storm dolls.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you, everybody, for being here today. Thanks to all the hard work for the city staff. Looking forward to voting yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very good. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. If I don't see any more folks grabbing the mic, I'm going to ask Councilmember Councilmember Brand, you want to say a closing word, please?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I if I had the choice, my preference today would be to abstain from voting for this. I believe that there's been a lot of hard work put into this. But when the city is going to invest potentially 614 million in tax revenues, it will forgo and give to the Ovg group to do this work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's critically important that we make sure that we're doing this right. And I am not convinced in looking at them or view that we're quite there yet. One little example is the amendment that I proposed earlier.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a parenthetical in there that says we can't provide financial support other than those that are generally available to any potential developer that is fairly high level language. In a memo you and I understand its purpose as a placeholder, it's not clear to me that if providing if providing $600 million of tax benefits to another project would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be considered, what we generally want are generally available, or if that would be an exception, that would be prohibited by this. And the distinction between where we are today as an emotive issue and where we'll all 20 billion a number of months for signing transaction documents I expect to get to a level of specificity will be clearer'",
        "'speaker_6': 'what we're actually signing on to at that point. As I mentioned, my preference would be to abstain today and wait to see what those transaction documents look like. But our council rules prohibit abstentions on the full council, and so I have to choose to vote yes or no.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I will be voting no on this. But I want to let the folks know that are continue to negotiate this, that I hope to be in a place when the transaction documents are ready, that I feel confident in voting yes on those documents when they're here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Baroness. Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilmember Wurst. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll wrap it up. Before I make the motion, I want to just say a few comments. Since we took a vote in May of 2016, it's been a long road, particularly for my female colleagues. The irony here today is that the women, not just the women, all the men in my colleagues, put in the hard work to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'get this done. The end of the day, I didn't get a bobblehead. I got called names and a bunch of awful other things. And I think some people thought, well, because that happened, that somehow some of us would be punitive and vindictive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But in fact, you know that saying if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen, that just made us more emboldened to do the right thing and do our homework and show up and read everything and make sure everybody had everything in front of them with the whole time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'US Our rally was Councilmember Bagshaw. Councilmember Gonzales. Councilmember Humboldt was to make sure that our colleagues had all the information that we wanted to have a partnership we wanted to, but also understanding the clear lines between the executive and the legislative branch that we would work with the executive branch.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I never started this job with an us or them attitude that the executive is somehow on the seventh floor doing something evil and they're going to send something downstairs that's bad and my job is to take it apart.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's not how I do business. So with that, I think I'm going to I'll leave it at that and I'll go ahead, make a motion, please. Do I move that council? I'm sorry, I move that council pass council bill 119088 as amended.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And second, please call a role on the passage of the amended bill.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No salon. I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'BAGSHAW High. Johnson. Whereas I herbold ii mosquera i. President Harrell I seven in favor one opposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excellent. The bill passes and the chair will sign it. And thank all of you for your rich comments and discussion. Is there any further business coming for the Council?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Swan Thank you, President. I move to be excused from the full council meeting on December 11, 2017.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And secondly, the customers want to be excused from the Council on December 11, 2017. All those in favor say I, I oppose. The ayes have it. Any further business going for the council? If not, we stand adjourned and everyone have a great day.'"
