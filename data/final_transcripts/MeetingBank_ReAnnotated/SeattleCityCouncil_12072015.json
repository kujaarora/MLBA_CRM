And I'm sure my my staff are following this conversation now and are preparing document to have you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And members of the council. Councilmember Carter, to answer your question. This letter we have received with additional commitments from Comcast represents several benefits, as Councilmember Harrell was describing, in particular for the low income seniors discount program. But Comcast has committed us to do is include the city of Seattle in a pilot program nationwide where the company is'",

And one of those programs is the City of Seattle Utility Discount Program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we expect to work with Comcast to implement this between now and mid 2016. And at that time, just as an example, if you are a senior who is enrolled in the utility discount program here in Seattle, you would be eligible for an Internet connection for $9.99 per month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the other area. I believe we're dealing with youth in particular and what is happening with that particular program. So this weekend, as we were working with Comcast to increase their commitment to us for digital equity in the city, we recognized that one of the areas the Council on the Mayor are very focused on right now is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'homelessness and the state of emergency that has been declared on homelessness. We worked with Comcast to say if the city could put some of our franchise fee revenue into a commitment and Comcast could also make a commitment, what could we do together?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we thought one of the more impactful areas that we could focus on is making sure that housing insecure, housing insecure youth and youth who are at risk could get easier access to devices to help improve their educational outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what we've committed to do with Comcast is to work out the details because we couldn't get through everything this weekend, but to develop a program where the city and Comcast together would supply laptops to housing insecure youth over the next five years of the franchise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't want to go back to sound, but I'm curious, in the first program you mentioned it was a nationwide program that they had with seniors. So we did one of a number of cities participating in it. But what I find unusual is that this came up literally in the last 48 hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did we not know that they had this national aid program? I mean, what did it take for us to get access to it? When we worked with Comcast over the past several months. We put together a series of benefits that we found to be very good compared to other cities like Seattle, who have recently negotiated franchises that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'include cities like Denver and Portland that we benchmarked ourselves against. There were some things like the senior pilot that we were aware of and we asked Comcast about, but were unable to obtain as part of our package. What happened on Friday is Councilmember Harrell and Mayor Murray saw the franchise package that Philadelphia received and we asked Comcast'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to go back and look at their commitment to our community and to recognize that digital equity is one of our core values and see how they could improve the package of benefits offered to us. And it was in going back and reviewing the benefits offered that Comcast agreed to make us part of the senior citizen low income'",
        "'speaker_2': 'pilot. They also increased the value of the digital equity grant from a one time $50000 to $500000 or 100,000 each year for a five year period. And to develop this commitment to put together a program to increase device access.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if there is any disagreement about the execution of the areas that we don't have measurement time, but we'll pursue with the assumption of goodwill, do we have any recourse? If there's a disagreement, this is a set of benefits that is separate from the franchise agreement itself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we would not be able to use the mechanisms of enforcement in the franchise agreement in the same way we could if Comcast did not follow our Consumer Bill of Rights, like when a customer has an issue that they would call the cable office about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so no, we wouldn't have that recourse. But I should point out, in the programs with which we've worked on Comcast in the past, we've found them to be a good partner. And Comcast has participated in our digital equity initiative over the last year to develop a sense of how we roll out more Internet service to different'",

We were prepared to pull the legislation. Comcast knew that we were I was prepared to move to late today to hold it if necessary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the executive and the Department of Information Technology are very comfortable and very proud of the benefits we were able to get. This is an ongoing working relationship, but I think that Comcast knew very clearly that certainly we were ready to hold the franchise agreement because these are ten year agreements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we're comfortable with the representations and the commitments that are now made by Comcast. And with that, the committee recommends approval.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I could take a shot at Michael. You could come up and try to give a shout.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The commitments Comcast is making to us that are directly related to cable television are included in the franchise legislation. So those would be benefits such as the PEG fees, franchise fees, commitments to the Seattle Channel and a low income discount for cable television service.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And how does the city memorialize those additional benefits?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those additional benefits in the letter are sent to do it, to memorialize that they will be provided to us. And in particular, the grant will need to be received by the Council through a supplemental budget, which is in process, I believe, for Q4 of this year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what I would ask. In in asking the same question that Council President Burgess asked. I've made it clear at least, and there are theory of promissory estoppel that they have made promises, they made commitments. We are relying on these commitments in a letter of agreement, in my mind, that establish a contractual relationship, perhaps not as stringent'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as can be in the franchise agreement. But it is very clear that I look at this as consideration for us passing legislation today, and I must say that Comcast has stepped up to this. Two, what we need and what's happening in other cities as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And but these are all great, great, great issues and great concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Comment. So whether it's Comcast or any other company, I just wonder, Councilmember Harrell, if that letter of agreement should be in our because we do not have that today. We have an offer letter from Comcast saying here's the things we'd like to do with you, but this would not be binding on them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wonder if there's any any way that we could obtain that letter of agreement between the city and Comcast that would give us a stronger position going forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition to the December 7th letter that you have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, this is a letter that's from Comcast to the city.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. We can do that. There's. Did you want to say something like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we when we worked with the law department on this approach, our intent was to recognize these benefits in a letter from Comcast that would be separate from the franchise because the city is not putting up consideration per se.'",

There is, as the council members have pointed out, some risk that without consideration, Comcast could change these benefits at some point. However, I should note that some of the benefits, like grants like the cable modem program we have been receiving since the last franchise, and we'",
