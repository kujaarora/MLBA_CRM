This resolution last came for a vote to the city council on March 15th, two weeks before the city and state eviction moratorium were poised to expire.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At that time, renters were terrified that they could lose their homes in two weeks, and housing activists and organizations demanded that the mayor and the governor extend the eviction moratorium to the end of the year. Minutes before the city council meeting on that day where the resolution was going to be voted on now, Durkan relented and extended'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the moratorium for an additional three months. And later, Governor Inslee did the same. As we said at that time, this was a victory for the renters rights struggle, but it was also only a partial victory because it was extended.'",

And already, as a public comment, testimonials have stated, and as I have said in my comments and previous weeks, the data from the real estate industry in Seattle itself shows that rents are starting to skyrocket starting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in January already, and that they are projected to increase at a greater rate than the rents were going up in the pre-pandemic period. So renters are facing a dire situation, both in terms of keeping up with the current trend, not to mention the debt that they are being forced to accumulate.'",

Lifting the moratorium and allowing landlords to proceed with evictions a month from now would be grossly irresponsible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And quite frankly, it is. I agree with them. It is not acceptable that elected officials would even consider lifting the moratorium before renters are able to get caught up on their past rent and stabilize their lives after this unprecedented emergency.'",

But to be clear, while the statewide moratorium is scheduled at this moment to end on June 30th, according to Senate Bill 5160, there is nothing legally stopping Governor Inslee from issuing a new moratorium proclamation.'",

This editorial advocates for ending eviction moratoriums around the country by making the neoliberal bootstraps argument that poor renters need the threat of eviction to be motivated to access rental assistance money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that such neoliberal arguments have no truth. And when you look at overwhelming statistical evidence, but we also know that this is the new line of the corporate establishment now. And we are seeing it being used around the country to erode renters rights from Philadelphia to Olympia.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it is being used as a cudgel against any any advocacy of extending eviction moratoriums nationally. The reality is that rental assistance agencies need time to distribute rental assistance funds. Renters do not need the threat of eviction. Renters need some guarantees that they will not lose their homes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as progressives, we have a duty to push back against this neoliberal narrative. Housing should be a human right and not used as leverage.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam. Councilor. So on. As chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to address. I am sorry. In order to provide the committee's report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. President Gonzalez, this is the legislation from my office banning the eviction of schoolchildren, their families and educators during the school year. It is common sense, but there are also mountains of research showing that when children are evicted, it has devastating impact on their academic achievement and their development and mental health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For example, the Losing Home Report found that code of evicted respondents with school age children 85.7% said their children had to move schools after the eviction, and 87.5% reported their children's school performance suffered very much because of the eviction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in 2018, the state found that nearly 4200 Seattle public school children were homeless at some point during the school year. That is a staggering 7% of all public school children. And in practical terms, it means that in an average of 30 students, two will be homeless at some point during the school year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a racial justice and Black Lives Matter issue as well. Just as Seattle landlords evict black tenants at much higher rates than other tenants, we also see that black students and other students of color disproportionately face homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we should make sure, of course, to understand the causal link between evictions and the likelihood of ending up homeless. We know the Losing Home report also found that nine times out of ten evictions result in homelessness. The 2018 state data found that fully 40% of homeless students were black and 23% of homeless students were Latino.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Even though those communities constitute only 14 and 12%, respectively, of Seattle's public student population. Preventing school year elections will reduce at least this one form of systemic racism that is affecting our students. In the class of 2018, for example, 55.2% of homeless students graduated on time, compared to 85 or 84.5% of students who were housed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we see a dramatic impact of homelessness and evictions on children, graduation rates and the academic research into the impact of eviction and housing instability on students and children is also revealed, for example, the negative effects of instability on child development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The report, published by the Urban Institute, found that children experiencing residential instability demonstrate worse academic and social outcomes in their residentially stable peers such as lower vocabulary skills, problem behaviors, grade retention, increased high school dropout rates and lower adult education attainment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And similarly, research shows that turnover in school staff significantly harmed the school's effectiveness. And that is why this is such a strong bill where it includes not only school children but all educators, staff in public on public school campuses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as I've said in the past, the eviction of children from their homes in one of the richest cities in the richest country in the world is a damning indictment of capitalism. But at the very least, the city has the power right now, just drop evictions during the school year and should do so immediately.'",

And so that's a larger conversation that I would really be interested in having and something that I've been most often and I've been discussing with renters and renters and rental activists over the years.'",

And I also agree that if it's applied in such a way that only small landlords who are facing this specific, difficult kind of situation, then it's then it's not that you cannot characterize it as a loophole, but the reason I would be concerned about it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is twofold. One is that I don't think it is needed because with little foresight, with a little foresight, landlords should be able to arrange to move in over the summer so that they don't force a child to move during the school year, because it often also entails having to move schools in the middle of the school year'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And that's the that's an onerous burden to put on a child. And so so in that sense, I probably this may not arise very often, but I would also be concerned that it may not be used by genuine landlords.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, that brings up the overall question of enforcement and the concern that an unscrupulous landlord might, you know, use of also just saying that they intend to move into the unit and they have no and but that they are actually no intention of actually occupying and that after the fact, it's impossible for the renters or nearly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'impossible to figure it out and then follow up and and get reparations for it. And also, I think this amendment would allow any building on or not just small ones, to move themselves or their family members into the unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I still agree that it is probably not going to be very damaging, but at the same time, I would hesitate to be party to opening the door. And so that's why I would not support this amendment at this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I really appreciate Councilmember Mosquito's interest in improving the enforcement in the future. And as I said before, my office has been eager to look into renters rights enforcement overall. So this is something that we would really be happy to follow up with you, Councilman, was get in any other council member who wants to look into this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I also wanted to share with members of the public that I have discussed with the small landlord who is facing a specific situation, which sounds extremely problematic. It is an outlier situation, but nonetheless, it seems like a very troubling situation.'",

I wanted to offer those amendments, then debate those amendments, then that committee, rather than rehash them here.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So for the three ordinances before us today, I had offered amendments that would have exempted small landlords owning four or fewer units in Seattle. Regarding this bill, 120046 this permanent bill that singles out educators or special rental protections.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of my amendments would have targeted the bill to assist teachers and substitute teachers and curriculum specialists, rather than every single employee at the school who might not be involved in the direct education of children. My amendment would still have kept the special new protection for the school children and their families.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another amendment would have made the bill more like the law from San Francisco, which limits the eviction protections to one. It is no fault of the tenant who is an educator.

        "'speaker_2': 'Another amendment would have changed this permanent alteration of landlord tenant relations to an 18 month pilot program to determine whether it's effective or what its impact is. It's important for the general public to know that this bill is different from recent COVID relief bills because it would be permanent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe we should focus on getting targeted funding to those in need rather than permanently altering the contractual relationships. That puts the burden entirely on the housing provider. So to be consistent with my votes at committee, I'll be voting no on this council.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, are there any other colleagues who would like to make comments on this particular bill? I'm not seeing any other hands raised. So I did actually want to just add a little bit of context for the bill that we're about to be voting on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to signal that I am very supportive of this particular piece of legislation. And as a reminder, we have I have personally sponsored legislation, and we have all supported multiple pieces of legislation over the last year and beyond to provide additional rental assistance to people who who need it in this space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, again, I think it's important to understand that in particular, some of these bills have identified funds, very much needed funds for to address the issues related to students experiencing homelessness. And of course, keeping students house has been something that I have personally championed additional resources for during the last three years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, for example, our families education preschool Promise Levy includes for the first time ever dedicated funding to the tune of $600,000 a year to address the experience of student homelessness. We've also provided funding for child care, for families experiencing homelessness, and we have added language.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We added language the Jumpstart spending plan to require work with small landlords in addition to language focused on families with school age children. Our 2020 budget process ensured that there were additional dollars specifically designated for rental assistance to go to families with school age children of overall rental assistance for overall rental assistance resources.'",

And yes, more rental assistance is needed and yes, more dollars to allow for an invest in investment in the families.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing stability is absolutely needed, but that isn't enough. We also have have an obligation as policymakers to fix regulations when regulations are part and parcel of one of the causes for why that housing instability begins and continues to pervade within our communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm excited to support this legislation and I look forward to future conversations with all of you who have expressed interest in identifying additional resources to support families experiencing housing instability. One of the things that my office has been following very closely is spending on the families, education, preschool and Promise Levy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And one of the things that we have begun to learn is that many of the dollars that we have identified to support specifically students experiencing homelessness, have not been able to be spent at the level that we expected, in large part because of at home learning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there will be an opportunity for us to potentially work together as a council to reprioritize some of those dollars, to still meet the needs of students in our public school system, but be very nimble and quick with some flexibility as it relates to existing revenue resources.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'self-certify that they are facing financial hardship. So following that certification, renters will be allowed to assert this defense, as I've mentioned in council briefing this morning.

        "'speaker_2': 'it corresponds to the potential lingering effects of the COVID recession. I think we want to be mindful of the financial challenges faced by smaller housing providers who lack the economies of scale to absorb these costs. I also don't think it's appropriate to make such regulatory legislation permanent at this time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neither of my opponents passed, so I voted no at committee, and as nothing has changed in a material way since that time, I'll be voting no today. Again, while this legislation is framed as being related to COVID civil emergency, it would be permanent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rather than making wholesale permanent regulatory changes to existing contractual relationships, I put the entire burden on to the housing provider regardless of their hardship. I believe we should instead get more funding in the hands of the housing providers and the tenants to make them whole.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, because there was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President I'm going to just say some brief comments about all three bills. I reluctantly voted yes for the school year evictions, but not for some of the reasons that Council Peterson outlined. But mainly my main concern and I did vote yes, is ultimately we do want to protect children in their families and educators.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I do feel like, as we were advised by legal, that there's going to be some issues on the definition and how broad that bill is. But nevertheless, I voted yes because I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, on this bill, I cannot vote yes on this one. I think that my main concern with the whole slate here and I think we heard this from legal counsel as well, and also including the preemption arguments and the recent variant case is that we really do need a comprehensive review of city tenant protections that work with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'state law. And I think this pandemic field recession has really changed the landlord tenant and the as we learned from legal counsel, the preemption landscape. So I think this piecemeal approach on long term consequences is really going to be difficult to unwind.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so it regarding Council Bill 120077 this is a defense, so it is not correct to say that you will be protected. It means that you have a defense when you go to court. That doesn't mean it's going to be successful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm always concerned about raising expectations. So what you're going to have is somebody to come into court, assert the defense of COVID. That's why you couldn't pay your rent during the moratorium. That doesn't mean that a judge or jury is going to buy that, and that doesn't mean that you don't get to walk away from responsibilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of course, these are not I'm not passing judgment because all of us have been affected by this by this recession and what it's done, but obviously to renters. But a morea a moratorium doesn't mean that you don't have to pay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It just means that at some point you have to pay. Later you have to work something out with your landlord, with notice. And so with that and what we've learned from legal counsel and the briefings that we've had and how it works with state law and the it I don't think it works with state law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's been was made very clear to us. But in any event, I'm sorry, but I cannot support this today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Juarez, for those comments. Really appreciate it. Are there any additional comments on the bill? I'm not seeing any of their hands raised. So, Councilmember Morales, you will get the last word as the prime sponsor and we'll close out debate after your comments and call the bill to vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Colleagues. So I do want to acknowledge and thank council members a lot for joining me in sponsoring this. I neglected to mention that beginning of my remarks. Colleagues, we know that thousands of our neighbors will find themselves caught with a growing mountain of debt and a looming deadline for when that that comes due.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we don't do something to provide a defense for renters now, we will face depression level, depression era levels of homelessness. So, you know, our system is already overburdened. This is a huge issue that we've been talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And even if a quarter of the renters who currently owe rent that fall into homelessness, our entire system could collapse. So this is about providing some protection in the form of a defense so that there is at least an opportunity for them to to have a discussion, to be able to work out the payments as council member'",
        "'speaker_1': ', as is talked about. And these are things that we have also been discussing throughout this year as we talk about how to make sure that there are different levels, different mechanisms in place for folks. So we have to respond to this impending crisis with the gravity that it deserves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to take action now so that renters who have faced a financial hardship don't face eviction, too. And as Council Member Water said, we aren't saying that folks don't owe the rent. We're saying that while they are dealing with a hardship during this era, during this time, that there is some protection from them from getting evicted'",
        "'speaker_1': '. This is the reason why they can't pay the rent for now. So passing this bill will do just that and will help keep tens of thousands of renters from the threat of eviction.

    "Ordinance on Tenant's Right of First Refusal of a New Tenancy.": [
        "'speaker_5': 'Agenda Item five Council Bill 120090 An ordinance relating to new residential rental tenancies. Giving a tenant a right of first refusal of a new tenancy after the expiration of a tenancy for a specified time. Requiring a landlord to have just cause for declining to give a tenant the right of first refusal requiring notice in advance of asserting'",
        "'speaker_5': 'just cause. Creating a private right for action for the tenant. Providing a defense to eviction. When a landlord fails to give a tenant a right of first refusal, allowing a tenant to rescind a termination agreement and amending section 7.24.30 14.0 8.050 and 22.20 6.160 of the Seattle Municipal Code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The committee recommends the bill pass with a divided report with Council member Sergeant Morales and Lewis in favor and Council Peterson opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Sala and Morales is customer Morales going to take the lead on addressing this one or are you just one?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, since we're both sponsoring, I'll speak as committee chair then of course, Councilman Morales and also Luis, I'm sure will want to add points.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect. Take it away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. This bill, as I said, is jointly sponsored by Councilmember Morales, his office and my office and co-sponsored by Councilmember Lewis. This bill creates a right of first refusal for renters to renew their lease unless a landlord has a just cause for refusing to renew the lease.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I've said before, this issue has been discussed by the Sustainable Living and Renters Rights Committee since March, and I really appreciate members engaging on this issue and appreciate being able to work alongside the Councilmember Morales office on this bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've heard as a committee from two panels of impacted renters and renter rights activists. We also discussed two previous draft of the legislation developed by our two offices, and through those discussions and technical feedback, it has become clear that what renters really need in these situations is the right of first refusal, where a landlord is required to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'give the current tenant the first chance to sign a new lease before offering that lease to any other renters unless there is a just cause. When there is need a new lease long before there's any question of eviction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, we've heard from hundreds of renters who've been in the situation or who are about to be in this situation and who are strongly advocating for the passage of this bill to make sure that Seattle, just those protections cover all renters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Few renters who are told by their landlord that they will not have their lease renewed are going to refuse to leave because the law says they cannot be evicted because in real life, renters will end up doing what's called self eviction, which is starting to look for a new place to live, even though they know that it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'unjust and that they cannot be evicted because understandably they don't feel confident with having to potentially fight it out in court. And in the course of discussing our bill in the committee, we heard from dozens of renters who called in for public comment and several who testified at the committee table who all recognize this legislation as basic'",
        "'speaker_3': 'common sense. And I wanted to express my gratitude to all the rank and file renters, not only those who testified publicly, but also who signed the petition community petition release from my office and just hundreds of rank and file renters who have spoken up about this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I wanted to quote Lee, who is a Starbucks worker and a trans activist who also testified at our committee who said, quote, As a barista in this city, I struggled for months to find an affordable apartment to rent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, the apartment that I moved into has become less affordable each time I renew Molly's because they raise the rent every year. I'm afraid each time my lease is up that they will refuse to renew my lease, essentially putting me on the street and quote and maddeningly whom I quoted earlier, a public school educator who spoke in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'favor of the ban on solo evictions, but also spoke in favor of this bill, who said for the first time that I was evicted. It was after living in the house along with five roommates through two full six month leases without any problems filling.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our rooms are paying rent on time. After the conclusion of the second lease, however, our landlord abruptly decided that he would not renew our lease and that we would all be having to move out. The second time I was evicted, my landlord told us he was planning to convert our unit into an Airbnb and that we would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not be able to renew our lease despite having no problems with us as tenants, unquote. So this bill puts the right of first refusal into the part of Seattle's law, which is Chapter 7.24 of the Seattle Municipal Code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections has the power to enforce. That means that if the landlord does not offer a new lease and does not have a just cause 60 to 90 days before the end of the lease, that's called the date that they can back up in court.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then CCI has the power to follow up, investigate the other landlord that they either need to offer a new lease or present a just cause not do. Is DCA going to issue a citation or a notice of violation and started showing fines if a landlord refuses to follow the law, all this can happen before the lease ends'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So ideally these issues can be resolved and the renter can get a new lease without anyone going to eviction court. And besides discussing with renters, we also discussed in my office with some landlords who contacted us that as I resigned from the council this morning, several small landlords we have spoken to support renters like legislation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some even signed our community petitions, but some landlords that we talked to oppose this legislation. One of the landlords made an argument to us against this legislation where he said they are that some renters are a quote unquote headache and the end of the lease is a convenient time to get rid of the so-called headache renters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the fact is, over the last seven years, my office has supported many renters facing abuse from their landlord. So when I hear claims like renters are a headache, I would ask what that means. I mean, this legislation allows landlords to refuse to a new lease if they have a just cause to refuse to do so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, it's a question of having been complying with Seattle just cause the list of just causes to review refused to renew this lease, not just any headache. So, in other words, if a renter reports a landlord to the Seattle Department of Construction inspections or housing code violations or violating the renters rights, that might be a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'headache for the landlord, but it is completely legal and just for the rent out you seek redressal. And it's not a just cause to kick out the renter. And as I said before, it is not a hypothetical example.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a case that we've seen happen many times. Just in closing and the initial remarks, of course, I speak in closing again. But but last week's Councilmember Morales, his office in my office distributed four technical amendments to this legislation, clarifying the language.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The amendments are attached to the agenda, and none of them make any substantive change. And after Councilmember Morales and Lois make introductory remarks, we can move those technical amendments. If Dr. Morales wants to move those amendments, that's. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you so much, Councilmember. Silent for the initial introduction of that particular bill, Councilmember Morales or Lewis, do you have any additional comments you'd like to make? Yeah. Morales, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Q I'll be brief. I do think, Councilmember Salmon, for providing a good overview of the technical aspects of how this will work. And I think, you know, for 40 years, tenants have benefited from some kind of just cost protection in the city, which is has been great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those protections for no guarantee that their home will continue to be their home once their current lease ends. And that's what we are trying to solve for here. So this bill brings, I think, the best elements of the two previous bills that councilmembers and I were working on, and much like the prior legislation, proposes a really simple'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fix that will ensure all tenants, regardless of where they are in their lease term or what kind of contract they have, that they'll be protected from a threat of no fault, no cause removal from their homes. It provides tenants the first right of refusal to either stay in their home on a new lease or a month to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'month lease or to voluntarily leave. And it also allows landlords to pursue removal if they have reason to cause reason for doing so. And then lastly, it does strengthen the tenants bargaining power by allowing them to rescind a mutual this termination in the case where they were pressured into signing one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is another way to make sure that we are keeping folks, our neighbors who rent, keeping some protections for them, extending protections from them, and also ensures that more renters in our city will benefit from tenant relocation assistance that is offered by the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, you know, as we as we start to move through recovery, as the emergency tenant protections are lifted, it's important that our neighbors who rent continue to receive some stability. And this is another way for us to make sure that that happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do want to thank Devon Silver now on my staff. He's been a trooper, really making sure that all these different tenant protections, the work that we're doing to try to protect our homeless neighbors all reflect what we are hearing from community and from our our houseless neighbors and from our renters in communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I really want to thank him for helping Shepherd bring their ideas into our council office and before full council today. And he is all I have, Councilman. That's all, Alex.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Councilman Morales. Because we're. Lewis, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'm going to be brief on this and rest mostly on my comments that I made a committee. You know, I did have the opportunity then to address that. Several of the issues that have been raised by a lot of folks that have concerns over this bill are are mostly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Addressed by the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fact that with with just cause there can be notice provided. So it's not a, you know, if you still do not want to, for whatever reason, renew a lease. So this is a pretty reasonable change to make sure that the spirit of our just cause eviction protections are defending tenants when they.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seeking a renewal to roll their tenancy that they've depended on and the place where they have found community and living as our neighbors. And to continue to do that, I think we in a lot of ways tend to take for granted the the investment the tenants make when they really put down roots and become part of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'neighborhoods in our city. And this is really making sure that we continue to hold tenants as as equal members of our neighborhoods and not somehow folks that that are more fungible and that don't deserve the kind of security that folks who own homes can enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think this gets us one step closer to that. And I'm happy to support this. And I don't really have anything else to add, but the co-sponsors did not add. So in the interest of time, I think I'll leave it there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Customer Louis. Are there any additional comments before we close out debate? Actually, we're not going to close that debate because we have four amendments we need to consider. So I. I got ahead of myself there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So looks like there's no additional comments from the sponsors of the bill. So now we're going to go ahead and consider we have four different amendments to consider, and I am going to hand it back over to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So want to give me some direction on who is going to advance those amendments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it doesn't matter to me. Councilmember Rawlins, did you want to move the first three amendments and I'll move the last one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure works for me. Shall I? I move. Amendment 1/2.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. It's been moved and seconded to adopt a proposed amendment one where. Morales, would you like to describe Amendment One?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. As I said, this is a technical amendment that acknowledges that federal law supersedes local law in this matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Three. Any comments or questions on proposed Amendment one? Hearing none. Will the court please call the rule on the adoption of Amendment One?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or as I. Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Morales Yes.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The motion carries the amendment is adopted and the amended bill an amended bill is before the Council proposed amendment to Councilor Morales.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I move amendment to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second chicken? It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill is presented on amendments to. I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Morales to address Amendment two and then we'll take comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. This amendment just clarifies that a new lease will start on the day following the expiration of the previous lease.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pretty straightforward. Are there any additional comments on proposed amendment to. Hearing none will accept. Please call the role on the adoption of amendment to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whereas. I. Lewis. I. Morales. S. Was scary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Peterson I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Want yes council president Giddens follows.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seven and seven unopposed oppose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion carries the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the council. I'm going to hand it back over to Councilman Morales for Amendment three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. I move Amendment three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill. Wanted an Amendment three. So Casmir Morales I'll let you quickly address it and then we'll take comments, if any.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. This just clarifies that a landlord and tenant can agree to a new lease before the 60 to 90 day window mandated in this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any comments or questions on proposed Amendment three? Harry. None will accept. Please call a vote on the adoption of Amendment three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whereas I. Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Morales as mosquera.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Petersen I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So want. Yes. Council President Nicholas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seven in favor and unopposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion carries. The amendment is adopted and bill is before the council. Council Member So once you have amendments, once.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I move amendment for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded to amend. The bill is presented on Amendment four because they were silent. Would you like to address Amendment four?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. This is also a technical amendment it refutes if it removes redundant language about how mutual termination agreements work when the renter has a housing voucher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there any additional comments or questions on proposed amendments for. Hearing that all the parties call the roll on the adoption of Amendment four. Whereas I. Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'MORALES Yes. Must to. I. Peterson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Swan. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council President Gonzales. I seven in favor and unopposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion carries, the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the council. Okay. That does cover all of the proposed amendments. So we now have a fully amended bill before the Council. Are there any additional comments on the bill as amended?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Peterson, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President I think I would have been able to support this legislation. Council 4120090 Especially with these technical and these good technical amendments today. If a similar state law had not recently passed, but a similar state law has recently passed House Bill one, two, three, six and in my opinion, counts 4120090 is preempted by the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'state law, which includes but is not limited to that House Bill 1236. As I understand it, local laws are generally preempted by state laws that conflict on the same subject matter, even if the state law does not expressly include a preemption clause.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's not clear to me why the city council is proceeding to adopt a city law that could burden the city with substantial legal risk. So consistent with my vote at the committee level, I'll be voting no on Council Bill 1290090 because of the concerns of preemption in state government.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, are there any other comments about the bill as amended? Right. I'm not seeing any hands raised because, remember, Sam wants more Alice or Lewis. Any closing remarks?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do the closing remarks, but I'm going to do all this to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She's saying she doesn't have anything else she wants to say. And I'm not seeing Councilmember Lewis. So you get the last word, councilmember silent and then we'll call this bill to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Contreras and Gonzalez. And thank you again to Member Morales for your office's work on this alongside our office. It's really important that we have brought this bill to potential passage in a few minutes. And thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for co-sponsoring.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This bill is part of the overall important victories that renters are winning today in Seattle as protection from unjust and devastating eviction. With this bill, we are closing the loophole, as Morales said, for decades left renters on external leases like a one year lease or a six month lease with zero protections at the end of the lease'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And, you know, we we in this council meeting, we passed legislation providing renters with additional eviction protections for rent due to COVID eviction protections for children during the school year. And we've urged the mayor and the governor to extend the eviction moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are all crucial victories. But we also need to be clear that eviction is only one issue renters face. It's a very crucial issue. But in addition to that, we also know that renters are facing unaffordable rent increases.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as far as the corporate landlord lobby is concerned, it's going to be business as usual. Now that vaccinations have been available and the economy is starting to go back to what seems like a little bit of normalcy since the last year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But nationwide, we're seeing every time average rents increase. And this was pre-pandemic, every time average rent increase by $100. Homelessness increases by 15%. The staggering causal link between rent increase and homelessness increase and rent in Seattle have increased by $100 many times over.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as I've informed the city council before, my office has prepared several renters rights bills related to rent increases. Including rent control that we will be bringing to the Sustainability and Renters Rights Committee later this month. But first, what we are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What we have is a bill that we will introduce requiring landlords to give renters six months notice for rent increases, which has been a successful measure in cities around the world. So we won't be charting new terrain here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will be following other cities that have already passed such a law. We also have sent to the City Attorney's Office for introduction a bill that creates relocation assistance for renters who are forced to move by unacceptable rent increases.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as I said, we showed a draft rent control bill that will limit rent reasons to more no more than the rate of inflation and is devoid of the many problematic loopholes that laws in New York or California have introduced, which end up affecting renters badly and also damages the credibility of the ability of rent control to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'actually provide protections. For the last several years, I've called for a renter's bill of rights centering around rent control, but also including all these other issues. And I thank Morales for also calling for such a bill of rights that is really important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And once again, I want to thank our in our office everyone in my office specifically want to recognize Eduardo and Jonathan Rosenblum, who were part of really making sure that we had everything ready and making sure that we had all our technical work and our organizing work ready to go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wanted to thank Adam, Jim Koski and Nick Jones, and sarcasm are also and also the volunteers who have been working with our office and talking to renters around the city. I wanted to thank everyone who called in support of the renters rights bills today and in the previous committee meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I urge everybody who is watching to join us at the next meeting of the Sustainability and Renters Rights Committee on June 22nd to begin the discussion of the upcoming Renters Rights Bill. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's so much conspiracy and that does conclude debate on this particular bill. So I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the amended bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whereas now. Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'MORALES Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mesquita I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Peterson So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excellent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council President Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'High.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Five in favor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two opposed the bill passes as amended and the chair will sign it. Will the caucuses affect my signature to the legislation on my behalf? Other business? Is there any other further business to come before the Council? Hearing than colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This does conclude the items of business on today's agenda. Our next regularly scheduled city council meeting is on Tuesday. I'm sorry, is that right? Tuesday? I think it's a monday. Monday, June 14th. Monday, June 14th, 2021 at 2:00 PM.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hope that you all have a wonderful afternoon. We're adjourned. Thank you so much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bye bye.'"
