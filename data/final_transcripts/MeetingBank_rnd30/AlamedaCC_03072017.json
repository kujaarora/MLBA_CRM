    "Consider Revising the City Council Call for Review Process to Appeal Board and Commission Decisions by Requiring that Two, Rather Than Just One, City Council Members Initiate a Call for Review and State a Reason for the Appeal.  (Councilmember Ezzy Ashcraft)": [
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Ms.. Spencer. So I brought this call for review. If you've had a chance to read the staff report, I think it's fairly straightforward. A call for review by the C o. It's my counsel referral concerning the call for review process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those words are just too similar in my mind anyway. My council referral asks that the council consider revising the City Council call for review process to appeal board and commission decisions by requiring that two rather than just one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'City Council member members initiate a call for review and state a reason for that appeal. And just by way of brief background. Currently, a single council member can ask that a decision of a city border commission be appealed, and it's been taking place sometimes without even stating a reason to do so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now there is always the appeal process that any member of the public can engage in, but that does require the payment of a monetary deposit to the city because there is a cost in additional staff time for preparing for this appeal process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The financial requirement doesn't apply to council members, and my reason for bringing this is that I think it's always good to get a second opinion, if you will, just validating that, yeah, this is this is something that we need to look at as a council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You would have to get three votes to gain that majority to approve an appeal anyway. And it just might be that those two heads are better than one and might say, for instance, just taking the case of the most recent call for review appeal that we had at the last council meeting of a planning board decision that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'had been approved unanimously by the planning board, and it was called for review by one council member. And this was it involved a private private property owners in some work they were trying to do on their property. I asked them to go back and tell me how much did it cost you if you'd add up all your'",
        "'speaker_7': 'costs to prepare for the Planning Board's call for review? Because the planning board did say, we want more information on this particular item that had to do with making sure that heritage oak trees were preserved in this project where some work was being done in the proximity of their roots.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was, I think, well and good. And it was a very detailed, well documented appeal and response to it. Those homeowners spent $28,000 getting their experts together, getting engineers, analysis, landscape architects, arborists. They have engaged an attorney, so they paid that and they got the approval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But then within the prescribed time period, this appeal was brought. They ended up spending another $4,500 just to prepare for the council. The appeal before the Council and the council upheld the planning board decision on a 4 to 1 vote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is money that these applicants are spending before they even get to the point of of doing the work. And I'm just concerned that we need to be mindful of the time and the cost to both members of the public, to our business community, and also staff time and expenses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think this is a reasonable approach, and I believe there's probably some public speakers on this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Did any other councilors want to speak at this time before I call the speakers? All right. There are six speakers on this one. If you'd like to speak on this item, please submit yourself. Kerry Thompson. Thomas Ellerby, then Janet Gibson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello again. As the Chairperson for the Government Relations and Economic Development Committee for the Chamber of the Chamber of Commerce, we felt that it was a really unfair burden that is placed on particularly the business, because that is generally the one area that seems to be called for review more often than on a residential basis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, it's inconvenient for both residential and business people to have to go through this process. The costs are prohibitive, it adds. It delays projects. There is a fair process for going through all of these projects that people are given ample opportunity to speak at any one of the various planning board meetings, city council meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, the process has to go through and to have them go back after everything is done and approved is just unfair and unnecessary. And I do like the idea of having a second pair of eyes, another thought process, and think that that should be a requirement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're not happy. The city council is not having to bear that cost. So they're not really having to think about it like someone who a private citizen who is having to really weigh that budget item for themselves to, you know, call that project for review.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If. The. Applicant has to go through all of that cost. That is also a deterrent to business. Businesses think, you know, they're not going to want to come and do business with the city if they're afraid that they're going to have to then have this project called for review.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Their investors are not going to want to invest in a project, and it's just not a good use of time, of staff's time of the council's time. I mean, there are a lot of other important things that they could be doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I urge you to approve Council Member Ashcroft's call for a review referral. And thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thomas LV.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening. At the last council meeting, my wife and I were called to defend a project that we have trouble with St Charles Street. We own that property and the call was made in spite of having. A unanimous approval by the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Having four or five months of vetting being done. By the planning staff. Just to give you a little bit about my background, I'm a retired executive. One of a three person council that was responsible for $6 billion business with $24 million overall business.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My responsibility is worldwide. I understand what the decision means and the impact that it has, and I don't feel that as I work tonight. The due diligence you gave to everything that you review tonight was applied to me with regard to my project.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'A simple phone call to any member of the body representing the planning board or the staff would reveal that the city arborist as well had approved a plan that was revealed to our mayor who made the call for me during the during the session.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The people that she made the call. On behalf of my neighbors, I'm sure they had an expectation that when they came here that they would receive a different outcome. That it would be repealed. But our mirror only represents 20% of what needs to be done to get it overturn it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Just based on my observations in the meeting, I didn't see where she made contact with any other council member. To have you understand why she had made that call. I think my wife and I have been injured. You talked about it financially.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of course that's a part of it. But this process has been tedious for us. And that call impacted us in a way that caused more mental anguish than I've suffered in a very long time. So I think what you're doing tonight is something that's necessary.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We need to rein it in. We need to have. We need to have the same kind of due diligence applied to what happens to me and others in this community that you did when you looked at what has to happen with the homeless in the seniors community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Janet Gibson. And Janet Gibson. And then Dorothy Freeman and then Gretchen Lebow. And Michael McDonough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in Janet Gibson, I know all of you in just hearing this gentleman's comments, I am very sympathetic to that. I think that, however, my experience with the referral process is quite different, and I think that this was an unusual exception.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I go back. Ten, 12 years on my street, on Morton Street, across from the Trinity Lutheran Church to the a small Victorian cottage that was there since it was kind of rundown when we moved in in 1973. But by the nineties and in year to probably 2000, they were the people had been there, sold it, and there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'was an owner who let it run down. It was a rental with several illegal apartments and the shingles were falling off the roof. And and he you know, he didn't fix it up. He just rented it. Navy was still here at that time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, eventually he wanted to tear it down and. And build a duplex. Yeah, we all know that tearing down Victorians is not too profitable because you can't build more than a duplex in Alameda. But it was a small house and he thought he could do it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the neighbors on our street were just we have a lot of nice Victorians. Several have were torn down in the fifties and sixties and we have apartment houses but but it generally is a Victorian street. And so we, we got together and we went to the planning board and it wasn't planning board, it was the Historical'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Advisory Committee. And we presented our you know, we thought that this House had a lot of assets to it and help the neighborhood and could be restored. But they didn't they voted to were to let it be torn down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At that point. We were able to use the referral process as neighbors in Alameda to to have a second hearing. And it was at at that time that I became acquainted with the Alameda Victorian Society then and Chris Buckley and he did research on it and indeed it was a historical home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The bigger home next to it was the original home. This had been built, built for a family member. It was built by an architect that was famous. And anyway, the council voted to to change that decision. And and now it's it's it was purchased by a young man who's been working all these years and continues to and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it looks quite nice now and will continue to even get better and better. It has been a real asset. That type of possibility won't be available to people who don't have the money to spend it. I think we're really talking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Finish up your comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. That if you want to be responsible to citizens in Alameda, they need this process to be covered unencumbered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dorothy Freeman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Council members and staff and public. I'm Dorothy Freeman. Some staff and business people have objected to the call for a review process as causing unnecessary delays and overload of staff. Time for business. The rules associated with the referral process are designed to keep action on the process short.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Within ten days after the decision, another major objection about the referral process is from the Planning Board regarding council referrals for decisions the Planning Board has made. The public has a right to request a review without adding layers against them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When the 2100 Clement development was before the Planning Board, there was a very important issue for a homeowners association rule requiring garages to be used for parking and not filled up with storage. The city staff, the developer and the community all agreed on language that would be included in the homeowner's association rules.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Parking in our neighborhood, as in all of Alameda, is difficult. So this rule was very important to the community. During the planning board meeting, when the rule was discussed. One planning board member remarked that she agreed or disagreed with the rule because she liked being able to use her garage for storage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was no further discussion on the rule and it was, as it was known, the project had to come back to the planning board the next time 21 came before the Planning Board. The staff report still contained the recommendation to the homeowners association to require that garages be kept available to park the number of cars the garages'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are designed for. There was no discussion about the rule until the last 5 minutes when the planning board members were formulating their vote. Then a different planning board member stated that the proposed rule should be removed because it would be a first for Alameda as no present homeowner's associations in Alameda had that rule.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At that time, it was too late for public comment or staff comments, and the text was removed from the highway rules. The community members requested a Karl Rove call for a review, but it was determined that a call for review was not necessary because the project had to come to City Council for approval and the Planning Board'",
        "'speaker_3': 'decision could be heard at that time. The council voted correctly to return the restrictions on parking and garages to the highway rules. There has been a lot of discussion about the time and effort that has to be has to be spent by the developers and the staff to call for a review.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The community also spends time researching the information they bring to the council. Our community group spent the entire month of August researching, searching condo and town homeowners association rules. What we found out is all and I repeat all, condo and townhome owner association contracts contain restrictions on the use of garages for parking cars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This includes all the homeowners associations here in Alameda and in fact that planning board members should have and the planning board members should have been familiar with this, at least they should not be making decisions without knowing the rules.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Gretchen Lipow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I'm Gretchen Lipo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Welcome.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, my team and I did some research on this, and I'm going to. And I we sent you a letter, and I'm going to just summarize it. We're in opposition to this referral, and one of our goals is to make city government open and responsive to our citizens as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Such a constriction of citizen access to the council should not be enacted unless there is clear and convincing evidence that supports the conclusion that the present procedure unduly burdens council and staff and has some other demonstrable, significant adverse impact on the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Ashcraft Primarily our primary argument is for requiring two council members to initiate a call for review. Is that an individual council member might feel pressure to accommodate the wishes of constituents regardless of the merits or cost and time burden.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, no data is presented to substantiate this claim. Our letter includes an analysis of eight matters which have been call for review from 2015 through the current date.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seven of the eight calls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For review were either high public interest items or matters that impacted a much broader sector of the community that the property that was the focus of the call. The high public interest items were Harbor Bay, Hotel, Park Street, shipping, container development, mixed use development at the corner of Webster and Taylor and the Harbor Bay Assisted Living Development'",
        "'speaker_3': '. All four of these property projects were approved by the Planning Board. The calls for review resulted in three of these projects being rejected or amended by the council, with the fourth project being rejected by a regional agency, BCD.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What our citizens should have free and easy access to the appeal process rather than requiring them to lobby multiple council members to call for review or pay the substantial fee required for a citizen initiated appeal. In these four instances, a fee of what 850 to $220 would have been required.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're asking you to reject this referral. And I feel like I gave a little bit of that as I gave a speech about a year ago on the container thing where I said a committee of people in Alameda spent in the city spent about $100,000 on this job to come up with a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Plan for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The area that they were going to build these containers. That plan was didn't have anything to do with the proposal that finally came out. And so we said, wait a minute. You know, does the planning board know that the city had a committee that worked on this, came up with a plan?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, I don't think so. And so that particular project was rejected. Anyway, I just want to end by saying, you know, this is a time when we need to open up things and be much more user friendly to our citizens and not close the door on them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Michael McDonough.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor and the rest of the council. I want to thank. I'm Michael McDonagh, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. I'd like to thank Marilyn as the Ashcraft for bringing this as a referral. And this is an issue that we have great despair over.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if we want to have some some facts, since 2012, up to 2006, beginning of 2016, I believe there were something around six call for reviews between 2016 and I guess it was middle of 2015 and the end of 2016 there were almost a dozen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's interesting that some time ago this wasn't a problem, but now that it has become a problem, I'm glad that you brought this up because it's important to bring a referral. The council needs more than one person to bring a referral like this, is my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't see why this calling for a review. Is that not true? Not true? Oh, that was my understanding. My fault, Valerie.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm the only one who brought this one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. All right, then. And I'm glad you brought up the dollar amount that the young man had last last council meeting. 32,000 or so to get that. But the business community has spent millions. And it really has hurt our reputation as a business.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Business environment. This is something we're trying to achieve here in Alameda, especially at some of the areas, for instance, Alameda point where we want to attract business. But if the business can go through the process that's established through the planning board that is appointed by you guys and that to do their job and it's approved and then'",
        "'speaker_6': 'after spending millions more because they think they have an approval, have the rug jerked out from under them, just does not do well for our reputation. And, you know, there is a process, so all the public has to do is participate in the existing process, which is the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then when they do come to the council member council here for final approval, in many cases participate in that process. And if they don't if they're so interested in these projects, then there is a process for them to have easy access to show their opinions, not after the fact, when they don't like the decision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if they are so interested in the decision, it should be possible that they would pay the money that's that's necessary to pay to do that. And it's been shown in the last year and a half, many times that that the one council member rule has been abused a bit and not necessarily by you guys, but it'",
        "'speaker_6': 'has been something that's been called to our attention. The business community doesn't like it and we would really support this. I would I would recommend three, but I will accept the two because I think that's better than one in this case.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we support this and urge you to pass it on behalf of the business community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. He's our last speaker on this item.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so if I can just reply to some of the comments and I appreciate the members of the public coming out and speaking. So in the examples that were cited by a couple of of our speakers about projects that were indeed called for review, and there was some modification made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is still no proof that they couldn't have garnered a second opinion from a second council member, and it wouldn't have prevented that project from, you know, coming back to the council. But I'm just saying that sometimes I think even as elected officials, we need to police ourselves and that it is not unreasonable for us to just'",
        "'speaker_7': 'have the opportunity to stop and think of what all the implications are. And I think that this is a time when we're we're moving forward. We have, you know, hopefully we're attracting new business. We want to create jobs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there are all kinds of reasons that someone might want a project called For Review. The addition of that second opinion and that the the person bringing or people bringing the appeal state the basis for that appeal, I think is just fair and reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So those are my comments and I'm happy to hear from my colleague.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thought each one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Them wrote me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, madam. I said a quick question of staff. So we did a referral on this last year and it's in the queue and, you know, kind of at the tail end of. Of the timeline. I mean, if we pass this, we would still have that referral.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Come back with some other substantive reform ideas or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a referral that wasn't this specific for two. So we would and that ranks in the middle, um, priority of the council goal setting workshop. And so when we bring that back. The Council could add this as a part of that to say look at the referral process, but also specifically look at this request.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And again, hypothetically, if we pass it, I mean, we get this is a change to the municipal code. That's where we're. Where we have that authority.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would require a change to the municipal code. So what you would be voting on now is basically what the city manager just explained. You would be telling staff to go back and look at modifying the municipal code to accommodate this, and I think it could be done in connection with staff's already work in progress on it'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Meanwhile, we would have if hypothetically it's passed, it wouldn't be implemented until whenever that is on the schedule. So we could have council direction that we want to be able to call for review, but. It may take 6 to 10 months to implement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So. That may be something we should talk about. I mean, I am kind of sympathetic to the fact that. Folks can have this happen with no skin in the game. I mean, the couple that had the. The garage.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, they had a lot of money invested and. I understand the business issue, too, but it, you know, kind of hit home to me more with a residents because residents don't have. Is unlimited amount of funds. As you know, we all like to think businesses have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And yet, you know, they had to expend their money. But those that wanted to call for review had no skin in the game. They could just all one of us, we could put it in there and then they get a free, free ticket.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if you get a free ticket, I mean, you're you may think twice about calling something if you have to pay $2,000. And I mean, I don't know how much I mean, I can't engage in a dialog with you, but I'm not quite sure how much you had to spend for that extra that extra time to bring'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it to the council. 3500 or 4500. So those that were against the project. Which, by the way. Passed 4 to 1. How to spend nothing. So I think there's an inequity there. And if just like I think I said this when we did the referral, the Supreme Court, it takes four of the judges nine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now there's eight, but four to hear something because in their mind, if they're not going to overturn it, why should they spend their time? So in my mind, if we're not going to overturn something and you can't attract two people, I think you should have three.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'By the way, I agree with Mike, but Brown, if you can't. But. There should be some reasonable likelihood that the planning board is going to have their decision overturned. If there's no skin in the game and I mean, I had a problem with then I have a problem with it now and I'd like to see this referral'",
        "'speaker_9': 'get implemented sooner rather than later if it passes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And member matter. S.E..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I looked at this and I looked at it also in context of the. It's no longer a referral. It's counsel direction because it passed here and it's on the priority list. The first thing that caught me was the requirement that a stated reason for and justification for the review has to be included.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think the one on the floor that I saw in the oak tree situation is that that wasn't there. That being said, some of the other calls for review did have the justification, but it was hit and miss.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that needs to be tightened up and I think we have the opportunity to do that when the priority. The priority set brings that ordinance back here as far as having two members. It means that and this is I don't agree with that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think any appointed body, there has to be an appeal, a mechanism to appeal to the elected body and there has to be a ability to do that. That's not cost contained. And I think in the act of going to another council member to lobby that council member to get your review on the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think what causes the problem or the appearance of problem, because we're going to sit as a quasi judicial body when the matter comes to review a planning board decision here. And we have very strict guidance from our training from the city attorney that we have to be careful not to prejudge evidence that comes during that review'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I think I'd rather preserve that and continue having the ability to have one council member call something for review. And then when the comment was made, well, it should be three. Well, if it's three, it's going to be a council meeting and we're going to do it anyway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's already time metered and it's ten, ten days. It has to be within ten days of the decision is when the review has to happen just like the appeal and as far as. I think we need to do a really good job in letting people know the entire process because I heard comments that, well, you should'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have participated in the process. While the process includes an appeal process and currently and includes a call for a review process. And that's the that's the way it works now. And that won't change. Even if it's one or two people, you'll still have to land that in your project that you you could have it either appealed to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'call for review.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if I could just respond to Mr. Rogers, his comments, particularly on the problem of the two council members prejudging an issue if that were the requirement. So currently on our council referral process, we could have two members bringing a council referral.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In fact, the next one is. And then if you go back to the Supreme Court analogy that Council Member Oti offered, I am quite sure that if you looked at the history of the Supreme Court decisions, just because four justices voted to hear an item doesn't mean that all four of those voted to, you know, in a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'certain way, it's what you would be saying is, yeah, I think this deserves a second look. And it might be that it comes back and the second look yields a different result or it might yield. Again, I'll go back to the planning board review.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it did make it a better process when it came back, but it doesn't mean we're prejudging. It just means that someone else thinks, yeah, this is worth taking a second look. And as far as making the appeal process financially available to our citizens, I quite strongly believe that if there were neighbors who came to a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'council member and said, Hey, we're really opposed to this project, it's been approved in our neighborhood, but we don't have the wherewithal to get that $750 appeal fee. What can we do that a council member could recruit a second council member, assuming it wasn't just something that was really just arbitrary and capricious.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think those are certainly reasonable questions to raise. I think they have reasonable answers. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, I think that there's a lot of presumption that that either you have to, you know, get another council member on board or speak to another council member. And that that's some sort of extreme exercise. You know, we.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Presumably if it's going to council. We do hear from all of you who are concerned when it is agenda ized as it when it is brought for review. And so for the projects that like the one at the last meeting, you know, I heard both from both sides prior to that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I and and so I don't think it's a huge lift to send the same requests to multiple council members. And that's something that's fully within, you know, your ability and certainly could be done via email or phone call doesn't necessarily mean a face to face meeting with every council member.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But as part of the due diligence, when when you are involved in a project or you oppose a project and have strong feelings about it, it's certainly an option to go to the council. And I think that to dismiss that as saying it's really cumbersome to do to talk to two council members and get support, I just'",
        "'speaker_11': 'don't see that because that happens leading up to the meeting. And I think ultimately at the end of the day, we're still having the process it still allows for and in fact, I think it helps to to reach out to the council members.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You going to reach out to them at the meeting, reaching, you know, presumably you've been paying attention to the project. If you've got feelings, you know, strong feelings about it. I don't think it's you know, like I said, I don't think it's cumbersome to reach out for the call for a review.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think, frankly, it'll strengthen the cases that we do here because somebody has to make a decision to call for a review. And I don't think when we look at whether or not you're adjudicating ahead of time, certainly the person making the decision to call for a review has based that on something, whether it's an ask'",
        "'speaker_11': 'or they disagree with the the factors that were looked at by the board in making the decision. So I think, you know, for that reason, I'm inclined to support the change just because I think it's in line with everything that we're looking to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's it's certainly feasible. And I think it's going to make our it's going to strengthen our process in terms of the cases and making sure that there's merit to them and that there really is something that we're looking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will not be supporting this. I think it is important to look at the facts. In 2015, there were four or five, depending upon how you count. It calls for review by council. In the entire year. In 2016, there were four calls for review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At this point, there has been one call for review in 2017. And so you think or calls for review in one year, the planning board makes a minimum and I don't know how many reviewable decisions they make in a year, but they meet 22 times a year, twice a month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would just say, okay, let's say they only make two reviewable decisions a year and that's 44 decisions that they make a year. Four out of that would be approximately 10% of the cases. The decisions at a minimum, I mean, it could actually be a much smaller percentage than that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I am concerned about the Brown Act. We are allowed to only speak with one other council member before something is called for review. And then when you look at the items that are have that let's look at some of these items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate I'm going to say assets, research and efforts in regards to speaking in regards to the facts of the decision in regards to the cell phone towers, the school district had taken action to remove those. That was that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Many people in our community think that it is not safe to have cell phone towers on top of our apartment buildings. And that was something that I think was worthy for council to weigh in on. I also think it's important to take note planning board members are appointed by council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They are not elected by the people and council does not speak. It does not go to planning board meetings and weigh in on the issues. There are opportunity to weigh in on decisions of planning board is to call it for review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is the process. And in regards to, for instance, the due diligence of the only way for council to exercise due diligence is actually to have it come to council. That is where we get to ask our questions and weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not do that at the planning board meeting, so it must come to council for us to exercise our due diligence that that is the place where it takes place. But if you look at the cell phone towers, I think it was a legitimate concern for council to weigh in on that issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you look at the hotel at Harbor Bay, I call that for review. And and yes, I a council level. It failed. It was a there was a compromise that I would actually say it did not fail. There were accommodate changes that were made in the parking on the Harbor Bay at this level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact, it was member Odie that made the motion that made those changes. Now, if I had had to reach out to say that, say, I would have thought, okay, which one council member am I going to choose to work with on this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then maybe I would have chosen a different council member when in fact it was member that came up with, I think, a legitimate solution of how.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To do it. I thought he would have done that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Remark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. Yeah. So we have to guess which is the one. And he, I think he made a good suggestion and that's where we went forward however and I and I did not support that though it was a leave a 3 to 1 vote, one member had to recuse himself, member matter, S.E. And then when that project went'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to Bccdc recently, again, we had many community members attend those hearings and Bccdc shut it down. So to me that actually validates our concerns that it was within the 100 feet of the bay and that it was not a good project and that's rare for B DC to shut it down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that does mean something. The Shipping Containers project that was also called for review, that was on 1926 Park Street. And in fact our council voted to not allow that project to proceed. So again, by having it come here and that was brought by a member of De SOG, one member.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then we weighed in as a council and we, we sent it back and it had to completely modify the use permit member already. And I brought regards to 1716 Webster so that when there were two of us that would have been allowed, but I again I would not have known.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh member Oh, you're the one out of all of us that I should be asking about moving forward. And that is because we can only speak with one. So. To me that that is the problem we lost and everything is correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We failed on that one. But but but again, to me, it was worthy to have it come here. Okay. And then the other, the assisted living project that when I called for review and it was rejected by council, three council members agreed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, and also when we call something for review. I do attend as many planning board meetings as possible. However, we do not get into the depth and detail of any project that we do when it comes to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the council level is where we really then spend time. Exam. That's where we do our due diligence here. And on that project it did fail. And then, of course, there's the structure recently at Saint Charles that came up that I brought.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I called for review and that one also failed. However, when you look back at all of them for a year has been the pattern, which is not that many. My opinion, and when you look at each one, I would think at least half of them have either been have been modified in some manner by council when they'",
        "'speaker_0': 'come here. And I think that really is council's job. We are the elected officials. We are exercising our due diligence when we examine projects and I don't think it is done haphazardly. I did receive an email suggesting that these calls for review, the term haphazard was used.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I and I don't think that that's appropriate. I think that each of us, before we call anything for a review, we do take it seriously. And we are actually and there was also a suggestion that by calling something for review, you are reducing transparency in the process, which to me is absolutely the opposite.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are there are many more people overall that attend council meetings. And in fact, I was on a bus going to to Sacramento today and I asked the gentleman who was very informed if he could name the planning board members and no, he could not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He can name every council member. So in regards to who does our who do our residents expect to make the decisions? Who do they know? Who do they have the relationships with? It's council. And as much as I appreciate the work of the planning board, I do think it is important for council to protect this ability for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'us to do our job and be accountable to the people. So I will not be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mary Spencer. And so I just want to reiterate for my colleagues in the audience that I'm not suggesting that we eliminate the appeal process. I'm just suggesting that we put a little more thought and deliberation into it and also that we be mindful that there is a cost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nothing is free. We talk about wanting a free shuttle around the island. It's a great idea and a number of us are scrambling to figure out how to pay for that free shuttle. It was interesting to hear the example of the cell phone towers decision cited as an example, because in that particular case, it is the state'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of California that promulgates the regulations that apply to the placement of cell phone towers. And the planning director had certainly made that very clear, that the city city law does not. It was the word trap, but it's a local law.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A local law doesn't overcome city law. We were bound by state of California regulations. So it was an exercise in a lot of time spent. A lot of speakers came up and voiced their opinions. At the end of the day, there was nothing the council could have done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so might that have been a case where that second opinion would have said, you know, we've got a lot of items and issues before this council. Let's make sure that what we're doing really counts is really meaningful and within our within our ability to influence.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, again, I'm not saying do away with it. I'm just saying make it fairer all around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in regards to the cell phone towers, we gave direction of prioritizing location so that when cell phone companies want to add them within the city that we have, prioritize what we think are safer, better places than on top of apartment buildings, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we did give direction to staff that they were able to use moving.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Forward in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A progress that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Situation because we realized we can give direction without calling an item for appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it has to be in front of us. So that's how that item came.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In many ways to that issue in front of us. But anyway, I think we've probably said all we need to say. Does anyone else want to comment? Okay with that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I already have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will make a motion that this council will consider revising. The city council call for a review process to appeal boarding commission decisions by requiring that two rather than just one, city council members initiate a call for review and state reason for the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have a second?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I guess I'll second it then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oppose.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Did you want to speak?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I was going to wait till you recognized me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'm sorry, Brody.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't want to speak out of turn. So I. Similar to the previous referral, I think the language of the referral speaks for itself. I think we all understand that we cannot impeach the President of the United States.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But similar to the issue with the FAA, you know, there is 65% of the American people think there needs to be an independent prosecutor to investigate the Russia ties and the financial potential financial misdeeds. And we as citizens, I've heard from many of our residents that we also share those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we do have, as citizens, through the First Amendment of the Constitution, the right to petition redress of our grievances. And if our representatives aren't listening to us, I think there's no better place to do that. From the grassroots, the ground level, city councils, state legislatures.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I want to hear what the public has to say on this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I join Councilmember Odion bringing forward this referral. You know, I think in a free society, we all have the ability to engage in free speech, to question the actions of government and our elected officials, and to demand transparency and clarity when evidence surfaces that something unethical, illegal or untoward occurs, which is the case here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think specifically in our system of governance, our founders, when they were contemplating what sort of government we were going to have, they were very clear about it. They wanted checks and balances, and so they enumerated a specific power for Congress in the Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that power is the power of impeachment. The House has the ability to make that call. And based off of the allegations that are supported by evidence that have been made, you know, the allegations are serious. And they undermined not only our system, but the faith in all of our institutions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, you know, at a certain point, we have to ask ourselves if what's the point of a constitution and the ethical standards that we're requiring if they're not being enforced? And so, you know, for that reason, we think it's important.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think it's important that we take united action in our official capacity as counsel, because I think that that means a little more coming from us as a as a council than just as individual elected officials to ask our representative and all of the federal representatives, because they do all collectively, regardless of party and regardless of whether'",

They do represent our collective interest and our collective interest in preserving free speech and not chilling it and preserving our system with as much integrity as possible.

        "'speaker_11': 'not just an empty action.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And just to close or follow up on the vice mayor's point, I mean, Nixon said it best. I think the American people have a right to know if their president is not a crook. So I pray he's not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I really do. There's, you know, thousands of political decisions we could disagree with. And this is not really related to any of those political decisions. It's we have a right to know whether there are financial interest violations of the amount annulments clause.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there are there are so many lies and cover ups regarding the ties with Russia and if there there's a lot of smoke there and every time something happens, somebody gets called in a lot in a lie. So I think we as a public have a right to have that investigated.'",

My name is Rosemary Jordan, and tonight I'm speaking again as a citizen of Alameda. I'm asking for your support for the resolution calling on Congress to initiate an impeachment investigation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some might ask if this action is necessary. Now it is. Since we last addressed the council just two weeks ago, the concerns we identified in terms of fitness for the office, emoluments violations, Russian interference and obstruction of justice have all become more extensive and more serious than on March 4th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'President Trump made serious, unfounded accusations against our 44th president, presenting another potentially impeachable offense. Some wonder if a resolution at the local level is appropriate or even helpful. It is this proposed resolution, like the one passed in Richmond and Charlotte, Vermont tonight and those being contemplated in College Park, Danville, Denver, Littleton, Montgomery County, Nashville, Philadelphia, Savannah, Seattle'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and others can help build public support for impeachment, and in fact, may be the only thing that can obligate reluctant representatives to act on behalf of the American people and our system of government over party. You know, Charlotte, Vermont is not too different from Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a beautiful small town on the banks of Lake Champlain. Folks take the ferry to work over to the big city there. They enjoy bike riding and hiking, just like we do. At their latest town meeting, whether to raise taxes on a network of recreation trails actually saw far more interest than presidential politics.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as Susan Ohanian of Charlotte remarked today, we do the little things and the big things because we are part of the United States, as well as being very concerned about what happens locally. Just like Richmond and Charlotte.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are not asking the city to initiate an impeachment investigation itself. We don't want the city council or staff to spend much time on this at all. Beyond approving the model resolution we delivered on February 21st. Passing a resolution is a courageous act, but it is not a difficult one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cities, counties and states call upon Congress on various topics all the time. This action is in that tradition of our democracy, where American citizens not feeling heard find their voice in their local officials. You are our voice. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council members. First, I want to thank you all for passing the sanctuary city resolution several weeks ago. As a first generation American whose parents immigrated from Egypt and Syria, my parents would certainly not have been allowed in this country under what is going on today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This resolution is very important because you, the council, are our voice for the citizens. We are deprived by the Constitution of being able to initiate an impeachment of the president or any member of Congress, which I think is a fatal flaw in our in our Constitution and our democracy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If one of you was guilty or had done something really inappropriate, inappropriate. The citizens of this city could take action and we could do something about it. We're counting on you to do something for us and to show the the federal government, to show the world that we Americans are not in agreement with what's going on.'",

I just would like to give give you a brief a brief summary of it, because it is so pertinent to what we are seeing happening today on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And these and these characteristics were common to Hitler and Mussolini, Franco, Suharto and Pinochet. Powerful and continuing nationalism. Disdain for the recognition of human rights. I.D. of enemies. Scapegoats as a unifying cause. Supremacy of the military. Rampant sexism.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Controlled mass media. Obsession with national security, religion and government are intertwined. Corporate power is protected. Labor power is suppressed. Disdain for intellectuals and the arts. Obsession with crime and punishment. Rampant cronyism and corruption. Fraudulent elections. These sound very, very, very familiar to what we're seeing in our country today.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Our precious.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Democratic institutions. Passing this resolution will not cost the city a penny, nor take up much of your time. The constitutional remedy for presidential misconduct is impeachment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Later on, when we look back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we will say that passage of this resolution tonight, speaking loud and clear for our Constitution.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Defend the Constitution and our democracy. And I am here to ask you, as our elected representatives, to do the same, to stand up for our Constitution and our democracy. I think that this president that we have now is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Certainly the first president ever in our history who has violated the Constitution from day one and violated it deliberately by violating the Emoluments Clause. You know, there was plenty of discussion. Before, before he took office about this, his possible conflicts of interest.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so he certainly knew what was going on and decided to proceed anyway with without divesting himself of his many business interests. Which receive a lot of money from from foreign governments. He's also, I think, the first president who, while he was running for president, actively advocated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A, you know, total ban on Muslims, which is in clear violation of the Constitution. Now you may ask, okay, well, what does this have to do with us here in Alameda? This is, you know, way out there in Washington.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But to me, this is not an abstract issue. My family and my wife. My wife's family were among the more than 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were rounded up by the US government and put into prison camps in. Various places around this country.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that was all done as a result of an executive order by the president. An unconstitutional executive order, I might add. So. To me, this is this is not an abstract issue. This is a very real issue. We need to take action to defend the Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The only you know, the Constitution, as we learned in World War Two, is only a piece of paper. It's only as strong as people are willing to stand up and fight for it. So today, I think that, you know, what we have at stake is our democracy and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Possibly, you know, our existence as as a people. I think, you know, we face the possibility of of a nuclear war and the dangers of climate change. So we need to do what we can to change the situation and stand up for democracy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Leslie Walsh. And then that e and then can. Can Cameron.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'of history and defending our institutions and our Constitution. I grant you that this is a bold request. Calling for bold action. But it is right action.

Mr. Trump has refused to do so, and the so called Republican led investigations can be dragged out for years, as has happened in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Donald Trump has only held office for less than two months and within the first month declared, in essence, that the press is the enemy of the American people. But does that. One pundit stated Trump may not understand the implication of this, but Steve Bannon certainly does.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I agree. Because it's a close cousin to Joseph Stalin statement that the press is an enemy of the state. That is a chilling statement. In many ways, I'm in disbelief that I'm standing here on a matter as grave as the one before you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But as a citizen and as a true believer in democracy and our system of government, I don't feel I have any other choice. I have to join my colleagues in this grassroots endeavor and ask you as our city leaders to join us as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm going to close with two things. Trump has just demonstrated that he's an undisciplined person, but his appointees aren't. So if this quote attributed to Hannah Arendt doesn't scare you, I don't know what will. And I quote, A disciplined minority of totalitarians can use the instruments of the democratic government to undermine democracy itself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And lastly, if any of you are using an iPhone. If Steve Jobs, father from Syria, had been denied access to our country, we wouldn't be using these little gizmos. So I leave you with that. Thank you for listening.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Madam Vice Mayor, council members and staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been living in Alameda since 2007.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is my first time speaking in the council. So why now? The reason is that I'm alarmed by the actions of the president of the United States. I'm here to support the resolution calling on Congress to investigate if there are grounds to impeach the president.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Given what everyone has said, I think that there's already enough, you know, evidence to support such an investigation. If violations have occurred, then the president of the United States must be held accountable for these actions. I do not think this resolution is partizan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The president's actions have been alarming, and I think we need to respond in kind. We need to sound the alarm that his actions must be investigated. And I believe the time to act is now. Emerging you to pass this resolution tonight and take the stand for our community and sound the alarm.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'With the eloquent marks of Isabella and Mr. Odie. They've sort of stolen a lot of our thunder. I just did want to make one.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of my speaking points, which sort of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ties this national issue and local issue back to. Those of us here in Alameda, the. City manager was mentioning monitoring the EPA.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the I would consider it a parade of horrors coming out of the EPA. We're particularly sensitive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here to air and water.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And having them be clean and appropriate. We have a great environment. We need the kind of balanced approach to public service and public policy and communitarian values. And those have been nearly destroyed. And we see that almost on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think there needs to be a lot more said about this. It's been said by our council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Steve Thorson. And then Gabby Dolphin and then Philip James.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Saving Mayor Spencer and the council and staff. I'm a long time aluminum. Third generation aluminum. I'm here to speak in opposition to this resolution. I can't believe you put such a stupid resolution on the agenda. This is just crass, partizan politics that we've been hearing during the election, after the election and what have you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It has nothing to do with running the city of Alameda. Now you say you want to. Make a resolution to petition. Someone. Well, you need my authorization to do that. And you need the authorization of every single voter, the city of Alameda, in order for you to say that you actually represent them and you don't have it'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I'm not giving you my authorization.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'City of Richmond.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Has passed a similar resolution. So I'm going to suggest before you go off in the wild blue yonder. That you quash this resolution. And you monitor what happens to the city of Richmond. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Gabby Dolphin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Madam Vice Mayor, city council members and staff. This is not about partizan politics. This is not about good or bad, right or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wrong. This is about legal or illegal. So those of you here who have law degrees think I'm not saying.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think about that, but I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'State that this is the key factor here. I everything I do, as you've seen me percolate on to the surface of Alameda has to do with leveling the playing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Field so that everybody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can have an equal chance and equal shot at our democratic institutions and the vote. And so what I do in this case is to say who can possibly be in that ideal sense, above the law? Not one person, and.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I don't care if you attend the inauguration of our president. What I do care about is looking at the legality and where it goes from there. It will go from there. I want to say quickly before.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I close, I really appreciate that update. Thank you, Frank, for the idea. I mean, following up on that and I might suggest you go to the Alameda Sun and under fire and police you list a possible thing out of your office, too, because we have something to really be concerned about here, folks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Folks. And it has to do with the symptoms of fascism.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'A community to stand together. You are a reflection of the community. It's never 100% vote this way or that for any of you, any one motion. But on the whole.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Kevin Garvey. I think I'm a little taller than you. Sorry. Here we go again. I will try to keep this brief. We had an earlier speaker who talked about whether or not this body needed the permission of every citizen to put forth this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are lucky to still live in a representative democracy. We have elected you to act on our behalf, and I think it's telling how many people who are speaking tonight and we'll probably speak after me have come forward saying this is the first time they've ever spoken at city council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That says something to me when I see this many people getting involved on an issue. Now there are some who think that we should try to respect Trump's office or who fall into the the ceremony and the celebration around having a new president.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those people who want to wait and see them. I say the time for appeasement is over and the time for wait and see is over.

        "'speaker_1': 'Swift action is really essential. As daily, he tears down more of our beliefs and hard won principles. Is having such a destructive impact on local and global standards is frightening. And hopefully Almeida's courage in passing this resolution, as I hope you will, will encourage other communities to speak out and follow suit.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I am not so far. Accusations that Mr. Trump incited racism. This is a characteristic that represents our former administration with his divisiveness. Openly lying about public affairs. Hillary spun a tangled web of them about a video she claimed triggered Benghazi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Trump's contact with Russian officials is more media propaganda than truth. Accepting gifts and fulfilling and profit profiting from foreign states. Hillary, the champion for women's rights, accepted thousands from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump is a man of his word.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Already confirmed freedom of school choice. And that is a big important. Something I hold very dear. I think it's awful how children have to go to the school where they live, close to where some some children don't have a choice of getting a really decent education.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'For listening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To what I have to say. Council members and mayor and Vice Mayor. I am speaking for the first time at a meeting. I love government. I grew up with a history teacher who taught me civics duty and what it means to be responsible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe strongly in the principle that if I don't agree with what you say, I will defend with my life your right to say it. I love hearing from the two people who have disagreed with my wish for you to support this resolution, because I believe that we learn best from hearing from the opposition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I support this resolution because I believe that Trump is someone who has never been held accountable by his own party, by people that are currently backing him up and his cabinet. It's amazing for me just to see his influence that he's had on the local level.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Carrying the agenda item before about housing was shocking to me that on that level it's trickling all the way down to our local level. That funding is now disappearing. That was something that was a huge revelation for me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to be brief and say that I am in support of this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council members did. We want to start with Claire. Any questions? We do that first. Question. And my question was going to be, how much does our city pay for federal lobbyists?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Um. I think it's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Less than $100,000. It's.'",
        "'speaker_0': '$100,000 or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Less than that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, this. I don't have that off the top of my head, but it's close to it's over 50,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's over 50. Okay. Thank you. Another question I have is some of these emails have that we've received we've received many emails suggest that it is outside of the jurisdiction for our council to weigh in on this issue to support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City attorney, I want to ask you if you think it's within our jurisdiction to support this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that it really is a free speech issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that, as some of the speakers have said, and I think the two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members, the vice mayor and council member, already have indicated there is some connection to what the government, the federal state government does that has impact on local government. So it's my opinion that you certainly talk about you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, there are questions from council members. So Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, some people have said, how is Alameda impacted by this? Everyone, including all comedians, are impacted, deeply impacted when there is allegations of tampering with our elections. We are all impacted by that. And we are directly impacted.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If. If this occurred and we are directly impacted, if our president had a hand in it and nobody is above the Constitution, and certainly if we're requiring transparency around elections and boards for our local elected officials and our our volunteer community members who serve on different boards and commissions, that they have to disclose financial interests, that they'",
        "'speaker_11': 'have to refrain from and abstain from involving themselves in any decisions or actions that could directly impact their own financial interests. And when our Constitution expressly says that the President cannot benefit from public office, we are all directly impacted.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're also directly impacted when free press is silenced, which is what's happened there. They've been silenced for asking questions and inquiring when evidence has presented itself that something unlawful or unconstitutional has occurred. And certainly, I would say the highest level of questioning by our free press is specific to government action and specific to our Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so when there is evidence of of these alleged wrongdoings, we all have a direct impact in this. And everybody here does. And our system is impacted. And the faith in our system needs to be restored. And the only way we do that is by looking into what has presented itself to find out what has gone on'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And I think, you know, in a federalist system, even little municipalities like Alameda have a stake in this and have a stake in making sure that our system, that everything has been looked into and investigated and questions surrounding voting and our elections and our press have been looked into to make sure that we restore faith in our'",
        "'speaker_11': 'system, because we're also a part of it. And this is this is one of those opportunities that if the lowest level of government can't represent the citizens of Alameda or any other community to the federal government to say, hey, please look into this, please make sure nothing bad has occurred.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Let us know that you're doing something about it. If we can't do that, I don't know who can. And we are certainly stronger together and stronger when we're united and we're stronger when we take official action. And I think it's very important that we do this and that the buck stops here and that we start now and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that we put the pressure on to look into this before anything worse happens. So I hope that my council, my fellow council members will join Councilman Brody and I in voting for this referral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's all just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Too long ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So this is I think for me, it's another issue that's challenging to figure out, you know, pros and cons of it. And I. Completely here and support many of the concerns in regards to our current president. Regardless of the comments that we need to have a voice, our people need to have a voice on this issue'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I would submit that we have a very strong voice for us that we have voted for consistently for the past, I believe, 18 years, something like that. And that is our representative, Barbara Lee. She and I've had I've spoken with her office several times recently on not just this issue, but also the sanctuary city issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And at this point, there her position has been that she's not asking cities to weigh in on this. And that doesn't mean that we don't have that. We can't weigh in on it. But there's not the ask at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we also have very strong leadership in our House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has spoken at least twice on the issue back on February six, that there are grounds for displeasure and unease in the public about the performance of this president, who's acted in a way that's strategically incoherent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is incompetent. It's reckless. But that is not grounds for impeachment. And then more recently, she's said that, and that's February 27th. That doesn't mean that nobody is listening to cases that are being made in a very scientific, methodical way as to whether there are grounds for impeachment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, I think we have very strong leadership on this issue. And when you look at the Constitution, the Constitution does, in fact, provide that it is the House of Representatives who has the sole power of impeaching. And then it is the Senate that tries the impeachment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My concern. And the the concern when it came to us in regards to the sanctuary city. At that time. We did have a phone call with some of our police staff. And the reason I brought up the lobbyists also, and I'll get to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in regards of our release staff at that time and more recently has been the risk to the city of financially. Because we we have a base out our name, our former naval base that is in the process of being cleaned up, but it's not cleaned up yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there's work to be done there. We are also trying we have a VA clinic we would like to have out at the base. That is important to our plan of how we're going to move forward with the base.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have married ships that lease. We have our Coast Guard island. We have I've received emails from families that are concerned with special needs, children, housing and other moneys. And in fact, the issue of financial the changing financial environment when it comes to our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then the question is, all right, so we did it on the sanctuary city. And I think that that was important because. That is, in fact, we are a city and we are the ones that determine whether or not we would then be a sanctuary city and do our best to meet the needs and and try to address'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the fears and concerns of our citizens. This is then to support this would then be a. It's a second time that we would be sending a very strong message to our president and then. Will it make? Now, I know many speakers this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's very important that you all think it will make a big difference in regards to our representation. And I with all due respect, I, I strongly believe that Barbara Lee and Nancy Pelosi are are doing their job as well as can be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that the concern truly is the red states. And at the end of the day, that to me is where this issue, if there's going to be a change in support, that it would be more so from those states.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the risk to our city. We are not we have a limited budget. We spent, I don't know, maybe an hour tonight on the discussion of $6 billion. The moneys we receive from the federal government significantly more than that and it's the larger part of our budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So ah, if we're were so I will not be supporting this. I think it's critical that we support our athletes at this time. I'm going to say I will not be supporting it at this time. I will be following the leadership of our representatives of Barbara Lee and Nancy Pelosi and their leadership and supporting their efforts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will also be doing my utmost to support our council, as well as our federal lobbyists, to do our best to protect our finances as limited as they are. Band member matter?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'SC Yeah, so I think on the sanctuary city issue, that was a clear to me a very clear protective step that we took. And I think the the question of the risk to funding versus the protection of constitutional rights of our residents, it didn't matter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had to protect that. On this one, I. I struggled with it. You know, I'm I'm in agreement that there is sufficient probable cause to fully investigate, particularly two items. The. Financial ties of the Trump Corporation to the president.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the effect of that and the ties to Russia, I think, have been in the news and have been well explained. And I don't like the characterization of federal government trickling down to Alameda because it's a torrent. When it hit here with regard to those two housing projects that we're trying to get off the ground for for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the greatest need in the city. If I thought this was going to do something, I'd jump on it right now. I think it will do something in the future. There'll be a time for it. I think we can do everything we can as individual politicians because I think as it's rolling out, whether we like it or not'",
        "'speaker_6': ', it is a partizan issue. And I think a resolution that we're acting as the city of Alameda at this time is is not really appropriate. I think as individual members of. Five politicians, we can make our voices be heard to the same effect as if we had a resolution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'd. I'd like to hold this off until. We have, I think, a clearer picture of what's happening in Congress. And I think we also don't need to put any more because people say, well, this won't cost us anything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have one, two, three, four, five. We have city employees here who could be doing something else to do the very, very protections that we're trying to do to for our residents here in defending their constitutional rights. And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd just like some time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mary Spencer. And thank you to all the speakers and my council colleagues, the vice mayor and council member, only for your eloquent remarks. I concur with just about all of you except that last speaker, but that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Dissent is good with the president and what he's done. And. But at the same time, one of the things that appalls me about this president is his utter disregard for the rule of law, for the institutions that govern this this country, the the separation of powers of the executive branch, the judicial and the legislative.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so as the majority of us on the council, Laura, I'm a lawyer, I went back and dug out my trusty pocket volume of the Constitution, and the mayor quoted it. And she's right in the article, one of the Constitution, paragraph five, the House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment, and then the Senate shall'",
        "'speaker_7': 'have the sole power to try all impeachments. And when the President of the United States is tried, the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall preside, and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So while I am as frustrated as many of you at the appalling turn of events in not even two months since this new President took office, I also am aware that. A symbolic resolution, as well-intended as it is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is not going to have the impact that we need it to have. What is really needed and you've seen this in these votes to confirm the various cabinet appointees. Is more Democrats or at least more elected representatives with backbones to say, no, I won't go along with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In this very state, we have some vulnerable Republican seats. I would urge people to act where they really can make a difference. Back in 2008, I traveled to three different states to support the presidency of Barack Obama because I thought and continued to think it was very important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And working locally, we can address the impacts of the administration's startling actions. And we've we've taken and taken actions. And and I credit Councilmember Jim Odey, who jumped on it right away. Some of us thought, oh, you're maybe being a little alarmist, but he wasn't at all in bringing the sanctuary city resolution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we passed it. And we are making sure that the protections there are in place for our local citizens. And we also just a couple of weeks ago, this council met on a Friday, and we spent six or 7 hours discussing what our priorities would be, how we can be an effective council, what the important issues were'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that we need to address for this city, that the federal government's not going to come in and help us with, and we're struggling to get help from the state. And we came up with a matrix. And at the top of that were the housing issues, affordability, addressing homelessness, preventing homelessness, then traffic and transportation to move our residents'",
        "'speaker_7': 'around and get people on and off the island for jobs. And these these issues need attending. And we also discussed and concluded in this workshop that time is a finite commodity, both the time of the council that we have to deliberate and speak with you and ourselves and make decisions and also the time of our staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so if we if it were just as simple as saying, yeah, I sign on to this resolution, let's do it. That might be one thing, but it's not the city attorney. We cannot say so this all passes muster, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're going to need that analysis by city staff. And still at the end of the day, and I do agree with the mayor, I'll say we don't often agree on issues, but I do agree that we are blessed in this congressional district to have stellar representation in Barbara Lee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I'm sure that she stood alone in opposition to the Iraq war when it was first declared in. And she was a leader and she continues to be a leader. We have a strong Bay Area congressional delegation, not the same in other parts of the state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But so what my concerns are is that. The staff. Time to carry out this. Very important, but largely symbolic at this point. Gesture will take time away from other pressing business that the Council and the city need to address.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I. I can't support it, but I'm not voting no. I will abstain because again, I would love to see some changes made, some pressure kept on vulnerable districts. I don't think that we need to lean on Barbara Lee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And but when when when Congresswoman Lee, Nancy Pelosi, feel that it's time for the cities to get together and and be heard. We can certainly revisit this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I remember one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Last chance to change hearts and minds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, of course.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I appreciate everyone coming out and staying late, and I appreciate the vice mayor for bringing this forward with me. We're doing this together. I just wanted to maybe point out a few things that may change people's minds and may kind of correct some facts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, I could sit I can go on and on all night about the political complaints I have. But this is not really a political issue. It's do we ask our representatives and not our sole representative, but representatives in Congress as a whole to conduct an investigation where there are at least publicly enough a prima facie case'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that there's been some violations of law. And, I mean, I don't think that that's going to stir the pot or cause us any undue harm. I mean, I was not put up here and elected to be a potted plant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm not going to be a potted plant. I'm going to speak up. And when we feel that our democracy is at stake and our Constitution is violated, when we did the sanctuary city, we were all reminded that we took an oath to support the Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And part of that constitution is our basically our country as a whole. So I looked I recall back, I think it was 23, 24. Section eight of Article one of the Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yet in two that I can't remember was oh three or four. I stood on the opposite side of the dais like Rosemary Jordan did, and I participated with there was five or six of us because we read all of the names of all of the cities that passed a resolution saying to the Congress.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We do not want to go to war in Iraq. Now that list again took four or five of us to go through with our 3 minutes each. And I was happy to hear that it's not just Richmond or wouldn't be just Alameda, but there are other cities, Nashville, in the heart of a red state that sends Republicans'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to Congress and Republicans to the United States Senate and votes for Republicans. So there are Republicans out there, and I don't have any problem with any Republicans. There are Republicans out there that actually do believe in the rule of law and do believe that our president should uphold the law.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I am not so convinced by the argument that just because the impeachment power is vested in Congress, because we're not asking to impeach, we're asking to investigate. If Congress decides there's enough evidence there, they will do what they they need to do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just like with the Iraq war, we are not asking Congress. We're not impeding their ability to declare war. We were, as citizens, asking our Congress to not do it, to not go to war in Iraq. And, you know, turns out we were pretty much right that we shouldn't have done that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I don't I don't see the difference between this and what we did last meeting, where we approved a legislative agenda. We basically said to our lobbyist, these are the things we want you to advocate for with the federal government or what we just did or 5 hours ago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or there was an issue of great import to the folks of Alameda airplane noise where we sent a letter to the FAA. The FAA is responsible for regulating airplanes, not Alameda. It's not our job. It's not our responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have really no jurisdiction over that. But we decided we were going to send a letter because we have a problem with the way the federal government is doing it. Just to correct a couple of things we did have Pete Stark is a rep from 22 to 2012.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So Barbara Lee, who I love greatly, has not been our rep for 18 years. And just to calm some of the fears. My understanding is that the closure of the naval base was part of the Base Closure Act that the federal government have responsibilities to do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the cleanup is part of a federal law that the federal government has responsibilities to do. So the president cannot suddenly say, we are not going to clean up your base anymore. So I just want make sure that's clear.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Coast Guard Island is a military base. It's authorized by the federal government. If Congress, if it's going to close, the Congress has to close it. The president has to approve it. It's not going to go anywhere because we say we want an investigation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The married lease is exactly what it says. It's a lease. It's a contract between two parties. If one of them breaches it, the other one can sue and recover damages. So married could terminate the lease. But the president can't terminate the lease.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if Merrit does, then we're going to sue them and collect damages for breach of lease. So I just want to make sure that it's clear that we're not fear mongering, that if we do take a stand and we do listen to you and we do stand up for the values which we believe in, that all of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this stuff is suddenly going to disappear because it's not. So I'm sorry that we're not going to get support for this, but, you know, we live to fight another day. And maybe I changed my mind. Maybe I didn't.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'll go ahead and make a motion. To vote to. Consider the adoption of a resolution in support of a congressional investigation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like to discuss. Go ahead. Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So to the authors of this measure, would you consider. A simplified resolution directed to our congressional representative asking that she. Support an investigation into impeachable offenses at such time as she felt it appropriate to bring it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I would.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, I would support that. I think it should maybe go to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House. Because we're really. And when? When I will say, when we do this in the state legislature, you know, we send these resolutions whether or not you consider them symbolic or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But they're they're expressing the values of our state through our state legislature. You know, they're addressed to the Congress as a whole and not to an individual person. But, you know, I'm happy to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the chair if.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I could do both.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So so I'm sorry. When you said the president of the Senate, you were referring to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The I think.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You talked about.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The tution. I think that's the vice president at this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I mean, I believe the congressional I mean, the assembly member you're working with also working for also has a so I mean, we've all on this dais spent a little or a lot of time doing our fair share of lobbying one way or another.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of the things that happens, and I know your daughter worked in a congressional office in D.C., did start mine, Mike Honda, when they were in college. So when someone calls into a congressional office, the first question that's asked is, may I have your address?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm here to tell you that even if I call, you know what's real common now in the South Bay, that doesn't hold a whole lot of water. So that's why I'm I'm looking for something that I think really would be effective.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But but Utah, I'm not trying to wordsmith your a measure, but I'm trying to see if there's something that can be solved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I can just if we addressed it to the speaker and the president of the Senate, our two senators and our representative, I would be fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then but the second part is I I'm concerned about the the form resolution because I do think that that takes I mean, there were a number of different allegations. And I think that that needs to go through our city attorney's office for some analysis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is there a way that we could make a more general request?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd be fine with that, because the point is not to say that we think bad things has happened, but that we think there should be an investigation to determine whether bad things have happened. I think Richmond, you know, had a pretty simplified, shortened version.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I. I wonder if, Madame Mayor, would you consider maybe a 5 to 7 minute break, if maybe do you do the drafters want to have a little time or do you want to just do it as you go?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would support I would support a break. I do think. Sending it to. Our representative or congressional representative, Barbara Lee is something I'd be supportive of in the alternative of not passing anything. And I think that, you know, specifically at her town hall.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She did say that and I quote, We're in discussions. There are lawyers looking into this building. The case, they haven't gotten there yet. I think you'll find members of Congress are going toward where the facts lead. This issue of impeachment is on the radar of almost every member that I know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we haven't got to the point where we can actually file articles. That was a couple weeks ago. Things have changed. My understanding is that there's now even more things that they're looking into. I would like to empower her by giving her something that she can bring forward when the time comes to say that she does have'",
        "'speaker_11': 'support within her district to move forward. So in lieu of passing, you know, what we have, I would certainly be open to an amended version.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to get back to Nebraska. So if I heard correctly, your request or your suggestion was that we would support it would. Alert. Let our really know that we support her efforts, but with time that she determines appropriate and we would be just supporting her.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, I would I would let the drafters modify their language. And actually, I would also consider the individuals that Councilmember Odie mentioned. I think it's not inappropriate to also submit to the president of the Senate, the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Harris and Senator Feinstein.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, obviously. Ah, yes. But the other thing I'm trying to do is so if we could get rid of the long list, because as you said, it's probably growing every day. But I'm trying to also economize our staff time and get to the heart of what you're trying to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'M.I.A.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Never met her.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think what it comes down to, if I've heard this correctly, is that. Our congresswoman is is working with a group of. Or delegate the of our delegation to build the case that they can they can present to Congress.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think on behalf of the people of Alameda, that's a fair thing to to support is that if they're preparing the case. Because we're seeing lots of reports. We don't have any facts in front of us. We do have facts that are reported in the paper.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not a I'm the only one up here is not aware of someone. So I do not know. And I think most of the people in Alameda were. The impression is we were calling for impeachment. And I think the to put a point on it having communication an official letter from the city council to Barbara Lee saying'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we back your activities and invest in investigating and building a case that can be presented, I think is the step that's appropriate at this point. Once that activity is finished and there's a case, then I think we move to the next level.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if we could perhaps take a quick recess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So we're going to take a five or ten minute recess.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have a ten minute recess out of the room.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Within the notice of what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyone could please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Take their.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seats. We're going to resume. Thank you very much. Appreciate your cooperation. It's now 10 minutes to midnight. All right. Vice Mayor, did you want to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we've if we could have LA read the proposed resolution and then what we would do is we would actually have staff. We would part. The other part would be directing staff to write a brief cover letter to the of the elected representatives in question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's City of Alameda Resolution in support of Congressional Investigation of President Donald J. Trump. Whereas various reports have alleged that President Trump may be in violation of the warrant or now emoluments. Thank you. Monuments Clause and the Domestic Emoluments Clause of the United US Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. Whereas, information has become public alleging that President Trump and his associates may have colluded with foreign authorities to coordinate illegal efforts to influence the outcome of the election and to undermine U.S. government policy regarding sanctions associated with alleged foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. Whereas, these alleged conflicts of interest and activities could be in violation of the Constitution and US law. Now, therefore, the City of Alameda resolves to support calls to the United States House of Representatives to investigate whether such violations occurred and are sufficient grounds for the impeachment of Donald J.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trump, President of the United States.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay so remember ask.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So question so this is directed to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This would be attached to a cover letter and sent specifically to Congresswoman Barbara Lee and then.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think the Richmond one went to the House Judiciary Committee chair. And did it go to the speaker? I can't remember. But. You know, I'm not sure it has to go to the Senate since. They're not going to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's okay. But it it could be with our representatives. I think it should be all of them. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All of our.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our representatives.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Like our California senators. I mean, and to question to the city attorney, does that require any further research on the part of your department?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. What it what this was designed to do is just say there were alleged reports of potential wrongdoing, which the er at the City Council is asking that the house which is the appropriate body, to determine if there should be an investigation, should, should look into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Yeah, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My comment is I would have preferred a more direct line to our congressional representatives, Barbara Lee, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein saying that we support you or building the case based on. What was said there. Based on what we've basically based on what's been reported.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the areas of. Contact with foreign governments and with conflicts of interest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I think those allegations are in what that what she could read it again lark and read it again the issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I agree that there are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mean I can put it on the computer and put it up. We just Marilyn just made me think, actually, it would.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Be nice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's our concern. I'll put it up in 2 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it to me, it wasn't direct. What I would support is that we're we're telling Barbara Lee and our congressional representatives that we think there's sufficient reports. And we support their investigation of these to see if there's a case to bring to the Congress for impeachment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my recommendation and it's certainly whatever whatever counsel wants to do is that since we have had no ability, at least my office has no ability to know what the truth is of any of the reports that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand there are reports in the press, but we don't have any ability to investigate those to know or verify the truth of any of those. So what we rather said was that there are reports out there, reports out there, which we can't independently verify, and it's not our job to independently verify, but that because of those'",
        "'speaker_4': 'allegations that are there, we are asking or supporting that the House Judiciary look into it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I actually agree because I don't think we should be spending staff time on this. I do think as as politicians we should be, and I do want it to be very direct and directly supporting. I think what is written here as far as calling these allegations is just fine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it gives our congresswoman the support she needs to actually do the job that. She's charged with doing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I am so ahead. So what if we added? Now. Therefore, the City of Ireland resolved to support calls. Bye. That's Congresswoman Barbara Lee and others.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, so that's what I thought we were thinking about doing. Was that there? Barbara Lee and our two congressional sources.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The thing is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With regard to the wording. Let's remember our constitutional guidelines here. The Senate will hear removal, but they do not. The sole responsibility for impeachment is in the Congress. If we want to send courtesy copies to U.S. Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, I should reverse that order for seniority.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's one thing. I don't think that they should be identified in the in the resolution, because we're not we wouldn't be there's nothing we can call upon them to do at this point in time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what about support Congresswoman Barbara.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lee's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Efforts to call for an investigation? Well, surprise. Well, I would have. So personally, that's who I would say that we need to speak to our representative to support her efforts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand that. I just didn't know that she had called or if she if she has to support an investigation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That didn't seem to be what the vice mayor said.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would just say that I think that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Leaving it as is and sort of in terms of just saying Congresswoman Barbara Lee and others because she's working with a coalition of other people. And I would like her to be able to take this resolution with her when she goes to meet with them to say, I have the support, maybe you should go out and get'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the support. And when we all have the support and we've taken our time and we've built our case, then we bring this forward and we do it with the blessing of our constituents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I like this wording and I can support it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then we just cc the others and the letter. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Courtesy copies to our our senators. So do whatever you want to make. I mean, I don't mean to cut off discussion, but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is so I'm sorry. I'm confused about who it's going to though. So far. Really.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. It is. This resolution is directed to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, but we would send courtesy copies to our two U.S. senators representing California, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, because just as a courtesy, to know what some rabble rousers in one of their cities are doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And not to the House Judiciary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Chairman or the speaker, I think.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can leave that to our congresswoman. That can include the others that we are. I think that's fine. I want to commend you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Keep it simple. I think it packs a punch.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it respects that we have a very confident congresswoman, assembly member Barbara Lee, who I think is doing her job. So I mean.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I mean, I'm good with this with. What my colleagues have suggested.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That you want to make a motion.'",
