        "'speaker_4': 'It's an honor to represent this city. I want to talk today about shared prosperity. I believe that our lives are intersectional and our experiences are all interconnected. One of our greatest callings is to be each other's keeper in the pursuit of justice and in the pursuit of joy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what I grew up learning in my neighborhood and from my parents as a curious young girl in Mattapan. Believing in shared prosperity must mean that if this city is thriving financially, all of our residents are thriving financially.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It shared prosperity means that if we have a construction industry that's booming, we have residents who are able to find housing and employment. Shared prosperity means that if our residents, if we feel safe and free, then all of our communities, including our migrant communities, should feel safe and free, whether here or at the border.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unfortunately, this isn't happening. But today I'm going to talk to you about how we can work together collectively and in solidarity to achieve these to achieve shared prosperity three ways. One leaning into our fiscal prosperity as a city to issue more bonds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sexy topic I know. To ensuring Boston jobs for Boston residents. And three ending racist and xenophobic immigration policies. Behind each of these ideas. There's a way for us to do right by each other, for us to do right by our neighbors.'",

I don't know how to cook small portions because growing up everything was big, big portions so that everybody who needed food, my neighbors, strangers, could come in and get it.

That lesson has carried me throughout life, and to this moment it informs my need to question How are we looking out for each other?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who gets a share in this city's wealth and prosperity? And certainly right now, it's not everyone. Let's look at the facts. At the end of fiscal year 2021. The city of Boston ended with a $15.5 million operating surplus in its operating budget.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Glad that I get to talk about it. We have an administration that is taking bold steps. We have a strong local economy of growing city with a large and diverse tax base. And because of this, we can lean into our strong bond positioning to help fund building projects like affordable housing at new levels and other ways that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we can creatively use bonds. As a former housing attorney, I spent countless hours in housing court trying to stop evictions. Evictions being a traumatic event that damns people because they're poor. I do what I could for stopgaps, to help individual tenants and tenant organizations, but always knew we needed to do more to stem the crisis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The more buildings we fund via bonds, the more room we'll have in our budget. To look at innovative ideas already underway in other cities to meet residents basic needs such as social housing, such as guaranteed income. All of these creative things that we can be doing if we are leaning more into how we're using our bonds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This hearing order on our bond policy will help explore the bold, yet responsible ways we can lean into our fiscal strength. Second is jobs. Sharing the work of the city must also include good family sustaining jobs for Boston residents.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We know that. I think about all the family members and all the people that I grew up with stuck in low wage jobs who could have it made. And we have it made these good union jobs available and accessible to them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's on us. That's on all of us in this room. I know this is a deep source of deep frustration for so many. The hearing order I file will offer insight into how much we are falling short and bringing community voice to the table to guide the path forward, such as hiring more onsite monitors for enforcement'",

Shared prosperity must mean we promote a welcoming environment for migrants fleeing persecution and harm. As a first Haitian-American elected to Boston City Council, I can say that I'm proud of this city and the work that we're doing to support our immigrant communities.'",

Two weeks ago during Black History Month, the Biden administration ignored the pleas of asylum advocates, elected officials, activists, and many of us here who'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Instead of treating Haitian migrants with dignity, our federal government has met them with whips on horseback, a cruel reminder of the savagery of slavery. Were quick to forget the Haitian soldiers who came here in the 1770s to help this country gained its independence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have an obligation to remember this history, to share our prosperity and welcome new migrants. I call on the Biden administration to find its moral and legal compass and to end these inhumane deportations. To be clear, this is an issue for all border migrants, because it's not just Haitians who are there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're all migrants who are there trying to enter and being expelled without making any claims for asylum. So I ask you, all my colleagues, to speak as one unified voice in support of my pending resolution to end use of Title 42.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been organizing other municipalities across the Commonwealth and the country to do the same. Not only would passing this resolution be a sign of solidarity with migrants and countless advocates, but also with my parents here with me today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This poor black immigrants face mountains of discrimination and rejection, but persevered so that I, a little girl from Mattapan, could dream big and stand before you today as your colleague. I'll close with this. Gwendolyn Brooks, who is a poet, writer and the first black person to receive a Pulitzer here, wrote, We are each other's harvest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are each other's business. We are each other's magnitude and bond. I think about that quote all the time and this call to service and in our collective call to service as a reminder that we are all bound together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We must show it. We must show each other what it means to be each other's harvest, to share in the city's wealth. To ensure all our neighbors are housed. To repair past policy harm. To think boldly. To make good jobs available.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to make economic possibility for all. Economic mobility possible for all, especially for our black and brown residents. We do this to realize freedom for all of us, and we do so by leading with love for all of our neighbors and believing in our shared prosperity.'",

While meanwhile, we know dozens of constituents trying to access economic opportunity, employment right in our neighborhoods.'",
