The United States Air Force has submitted the JBAB Installation Development Framework Plan. The Bolling District Plan and Transportation Management Plan for final approval today. Previously, this past November, we commented on the draft versions of these plans and the Air Force has since added some information to their final plans before us here today. They will provide additional, more detailed information to our Commission through future plans and guidance documents, which I will describe during my presentation. As the final plan review submission, we are considering how the applicant has responded to our previous comments and recommendations, taking into account the nature and intended purpose of the plans. In this case, that the final submission provides enough guidance to inform additional, more detailed planning documents to be submitted for future NCPC review. Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling,'",

The Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge to the north. South Capitol Street and I-295 to the east. And the Potomac and Anacostia rivers along its west side. JBAB is located approximately one and a half miles to the southeast of the U.S. Capitol building. And at the base of the Washington topographic bowl, just to the west of the Department of Homeland Securities, St. Elizabeths Campus. JBAB currently has a maximum population of 17,000 military and civilian employees and families hosting units that include the National Guard, Military Reserve, United States Coast Guard, and other federal agency personnel. Similar to a small city, the 966-acre installation has a wide range of land uses with approximately 1,000 privatized homes and a mix of'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'other uses that include parks and open space, a commissary and base exchange, communications and air operations facilities, military barracks, child development centers and administrative buildings. As a reminder, notable features of JBAB include its raised earthen levee sea wall system along the western river shoreline with a recreational trail along its length and prominent views to the west looking toward downtown Washington, D.C. JBAB currently has three operational gates in the 28-mile internal roadway system that is comprised of primary, secondary and local roadways. And a sizeable portion of installation currently resides within the 100 and 500-year floodplain areas, which includes part of the Bolling District shown here in yellow. Here's a graphic from the final Bolling District Plan that show future conceptual development within the District. Since several of these sites are located within the existing 500-year floodplain, we previously requested additional information on how the Air Force'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'would plan, design and develop these areas to manage their risk of flooding in accordance with Executive Order 13690. Here's a list of planning topics that our Commission previously commented on including Executive Order 13690 compliance, future development locations, eco-friendly surface parking and landscape guidelines, new tree planting priority areas, and how the Air Force will attain its renewable energy goals for the installation. But first I would like to provide some context for the current submission as the Air Force now has oversight responsibilities for JBAB, and the applicant is currently in the midst of a two-year effort to develop requisite plans, policies and guidance documents for the installation per Air Force governance regulations. Air Force planning process differs from many other federal installations where there is a single master plan with chapters that address each topic area such as transportation, landscaping, land use, planning constraint and other related'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'topics. Rather, the Air Force process, which applies to all Air Force installations and now includes JBAB, consists of an initial broader level framework plan, which we are reviewing here today, and then a series of follow-up separate District area and component plans with a single standards document known as the Installation Facility Standards. The table on this slide helps illustrate the interconnected hierarchy between these Air Force plans. Here are the current Air Force plans that we are reviewing at today's Commission meeting, the framework plan, a district plan, and a transportation management plan and how they all fit together within the Air Force planning structure. Previously, our Commission expressed support for the JBAB installation development framework plan strategies and goals, which included making efficient and effective use of limited land through infill development, consolidation of functions and appropriate facility siting, preserving development potential for future growth, adapting to'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'and mitigating climate change and sea level rise, and honoring and communicating the historic significance of the installation. These strategies and goals in the plan remain unchanged from their previous draft submission. Regarding future planning at JBAB, the Air Force will submit three other JBAB District Plans to NCPC for review during the spring and summer of this year. The Air Force will also submit their new JBAB Installation Facility Standards document for NCPC review by this summer as well. Here is part of a typical table of contents from the Dover Air Force Base Installation Facility Standards shown on the right, which helps illustrate the great level of detail that is provided through these types of documents related to things like tree planning, landscaping, architectural design and streetscape standards. The Air Force uses a similar standards document for each of their installations nationwide. 1 2 3 4 5 6'",

They plan to provide information from these and other JBAB component plans to NCPC for a review in 2023. For the remainder of my presentation, I will now go through how the Air Force revised its final IDP framework, Bolling and transportation management plans in light of our previous comments from November and how they plan to provide additional, more detailed development guidance in the future, and why we are satisfied that the Air Force will continue to address our previous comments through their future plan submissions. Regarding Executive Order 13690, which pertains to federal development within the 100 and 500-year floodplains, the Air Force revised'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'several sections of their IDP framework and district plans to specify their intent to comply with the new executive order adding language to the constraint summaries, form-based planning, planning district summaries, and the preferred Bolling District alternative sections. In addition, the Air Force has committed to improving JBAB's earthen levee to withstand higher flood events to developing a future climate action and resiliency plan and incorporating future executive order guidance into their integrated natural resources management plan for JBAB. I would also like to note the Air Force's ongoing participation in Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments study known as the military installation resilience review, which is tasked with identifying risks, hazards and vulnerabilities to JBAB and other military installations within the District from flooding, energy insecurity, and aging infrastructure. As shown here on this slide, we acknowledged JBAB's role in the COG study and recommend that the Air Force use'",

So staff finds the updates provided in the final Air Force submission, in addition to the levee project, ongoing COG study, and scheduled future climate action and resiliency plan for JBAB, that the Commission's previous executive order request has been addressed to the extent possible through the current submission given the broader nature of the framework and district plans. And the Air Force will continue to address previous comments through its continuing installation planning process. In response to our recommendation to prioritize Bolling District development on surface parking, which would remove capacity outside of the flood risk area and help to preserve open space, the Historic Bolling Plan now includes a recommendation as additional guidance to help develop future Bolling District projects. Regarding our previous request for eco-friendly surface'",

WEIL': 'parking and installation of landscape guidelines as the current submission includes broader-leveled documents per Air Force requirements, JBAB would provide those details through their future Installation Facility Standards document as exemplified by our previous IFS table of contents example slide. We note that the stated IFS purpose, which is to maintain efficient operations, reduce costs, reduce energy and water use and establish consistent standards. And this sustainability focus will serve as a foundation for future green landscaping and parking design guidelines. And NCPC staff will continue to work with the Air Force to ensure that the Commission's guidance is reflected in their forthcoming IFS document. Regarding tree priority planting areas, the IDP framework cites an installation- wide goal to increase tree canopy in multiple sections. More specifically, the plan specifies the use of additional planting layers in areas where tree canopy increases are likely to occur. The IDP framework also'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'includes language that includes JBAB's intent to establish park-like corridors to improve pedestrian, bicycle and recreational connections with new tree plantings, along with photo simulations that illustrate the Air Force's intent to establish these improved streetscapes. Based on this broader level of content, staff is satisfied that the Air Force intends to increase trees on the installation. We will continue to work with the Applicant to ensure that additional tree placement guidance is provided through their future IFS document. The Air Force includes a strategy to establish development patterns and operational policies to encourage renewable energy projects within the constraints section of the IDP, which is appropriate for its broader level scope. Future details will be forthcoming through their future Installation Energy Plan with information pertaining to current energy usage, trends and goals and potential energy attainment alternatives. Separate from this review, the previous 2014 master plan identified a number'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'of potential sites for future solar panel installations, which continue to remain relevant today. I'd also like to note JBAB's current 25- year power purchase agreement, which has resulted in several recent on-site solar panel installations and their agreement continues to offer the possibility of future installations. So staff is satisfied based upon the Air Force's intent to develop an energy-focused component plan for JBAB that the current IDP framework and Bolling plans provide a good basis for developing that information in response to our previous draft review comments. The Air Force includes a number of strategies in the final IDP and Bolling District Plan that communicate their commitment to historic preservation in complying with Section 106 requirements. This is all based on a foundational planning goal to preserve JBAB's heritage. The Air Force currently maintains a computerized database with the installation known as the ICRMP that inventories JBAB's historic'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'and cultural assets and features, serving as a useful planning tool to help identify potential adverse effects from future development during early project development phases. Finally, the Air Force communicates that they will undergo the Section 106 process for all their future projects in consultation with the D.C. SHPO and NCPC. So staff is satisfied that the final JBAB's submission expresses an appropriate level of commitment to preserving the installations' cultural and historic features, and that the Air Force will reinforce the content of its broader IDP framework and Bolling District Plans with more detailed guidance through their forthcoming standards document. And this is an appropriate response to our previous Commission comments. We note the Air Force's intent to comply with Section 106 for its future projects in the final Executive Director's recommendation, and we request that a future coordination with the D.C.

SHPO as previously noted, and NCPC as they develop their Future Standards Document and other future district component plans. Here is a summary table that summarizes how the Air Force responded to our previous comments in their current submission and how they will continue to respond through future planning and guidance documents over the next year and a half.

As was just briefed but just to reiterate, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling experienced a lead service transfer from the Navy to the Air Force in October of 2020. During this time from October of 2020 to October of 2022, we've been standing up our 11th Wing here at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling and preparing a variety of Air Force-based master planning documents. Those include the Installation and Development Plan, four District Plans, the Transportation Plan, the Installation Facility Standard, the Installation Energy Plan, and the Climate Resilience.

We are really just very proud of our relationships and engagements and partnerships around the region. We provided tours of the installation as you all are tracking for NCPC. I'm sorry I couldn't be present for those previous tours, but our Vice Commander Colonel Rabe was there. We did tours with GSA and DHS, highlighting many of the environment-friendly programs that were just highlighted in the previous presentation.

It's been a wonderful working relationship working with Mike over many years, but specifically on these planning documents. I'm just going to follow up with a couple of the comments that Mr. Weil made so everyone's tracking how the Air Force documents are laid out by our Air Force instruction, which follows DoD instruction, and how those plans work together. To start off, you're seeing today the IDP, the Installation Development Plan. That's our 10,000-foot level plan. That's way up in the sky and what does the base look like from above. It goes over land use constraints and opportunities. And the District Plan kind of nests into that, so we have four. We've completed one so far in our Historic Bolling Town Center, which is the heart of JBAB in a lot of ways and especially of the'",
        "'MS. KELLERKRATZER': 'Air Force missions. That's that 5,000-foot level, and that gets into where our development opportunities, more of that personal-level development so we can look forward to future projects as well as transportation opportunities and cost benefits. Both of those documents live on the Air Force comprehensive planning platform, which is the dynamic live version of our planning document. So we submit these on a five-year rotational basis, but we don't just put these on a shelf. We continue to keep these documents alive. Those documents help inform all of the projects that we're doing, those major renovations as well as military construction. And we continue to submit those projects on a project review basis to NCPC. And then finally the last document you're seeing today is that Transportation Management Plan, which really overlays how all of these things are connected together. The two other documents that did not come before'",
        "'MS. KELLERKRATZER': 'you today are the Installation Facilities Standards. We are currently working on those. That is more than just a planning document. That's also architectural standards, landscape standards, planting trees, signage, parking facilities, road classifications, site planning, even interiors and exteriors. So it gets into that. It also breaks it down by similar facilities around them. For example, our historic districts. We will have standards specific to make sure that we're compatible with those historic areas. We are working on those right now. We're going to incorporate those tree planting standards and make sure we get good native species worked in there. We'll have that document before NCPC as well once we get concurrence from our 70 mission partners, our Air Force leadership, as well as the Wing Commander. That will also go through Section 106 coordination to make sure those historic areas are well-taken care of. The second document that'",
        "'MS. KELLERKRATZER': 'I know will address a lot of the questions that have come up as part of this review is the Installation Energy Plan. That's essentially a decision-making framework more so than it is a planning document. DoD has rolled these out recently to help us not only achieve energy goals, but also to ensure resiliency for energy and water to make sure that our mission assurance is there. It works in tandem with IDP, so it's great that the IDP is complete so that the documents can feed off one of the other and inform each other. We will continue to work that document. It's going to include energy-specific strategies for JBAB such as power redundancy, storage, backup alternative, and renewable energy, specifically solar, around JBAB. Energy management and control systems in our buildings. Building envelope sealing, HVAC, and lighting performance upgrades in our existing buildings, preventative maintenance, water conservation'",
        "'MS. KELLERKRATZER': 'and backup water supplies. As Mr. Weil has already demonstrated, JBAB is committed to alternative energy. We have one of the largest solar arrays in the District of Columbia. That's good for the DoD as well as the Air Force because alternative energies really allow us to get that resiliency and redundancy in ways that traditional energy sources do not. Finally, we are working towards a climate resiliency plan that goes beyond just weather and planning and that kind of thing, but really looks at how do you keep the installation running well into the future. How do you protect those missions. Air Force at large is still working on exactly what that means, so that's going to be a moving document in a lot of ways as we get continued guidance from the Air Force on what that document should look like. All of these documents will work together,'",
        "'MS. KELLERKRATZER': 'and they will inform every project and change that we make on the installation. They'll cover development transportation, sustainability, resilience, the Section 106 historic process and our great relationship with D.C. SHPO. We will also get into those architectural and landscape guidelines. We continue to reach out to Ward 8. We had a great meeting with them right around the holidays where we actually met several of the members of the community. We're looking forward to being able to get out there post-COVID and have some of these meetings in person like we used to before 2020. We're also continuing to work with D.C. SHPO on several projects. They were an excellent partner in getting us through the charter school process as well as DDOT was. We have excellent relationships with DOEE. They're on our base nearly every day checking on how we're doing in terms of energy compliance. Just'",
        "'MS. KELLERKRATZER': 'to wrap up, we do plan to present the remaining three District Plans in the next year or so. And then if the IFS, the Installations Facilities Standards, and the energy plans become available, we'll also get those to the Board. Thank you.'",

It's hard to really understand and digest it all, but since we are reviewing the framework plan here, the thing that I still feel is lacking in a way is some of the more aspirational goals that we discussed in the previous reviews. I was kind of hoping we would see a more definitive -- the way it's written, it sort of checks all the boxes, we got to meet the Executive Order, there will be follow-up, more detailed guidelines and things like that. So everything is sort of there, but the way it's being presented to us, and I assume that this is coming out of what the document is, it's like the bureaucracy of the federal planning operation that robbed the vision that could be here. The vision is there, it just doesn't feel like it. Now, it'",

It just feels like there could be more definitive statements of the aspiration to plant more trees, to improve the pedestrian experience and so on. I think the most definitive statements have to do with renewable energy. That's probably the one that stands out among them all. There's nothing in here to really object to, but there's just nothing in here for me to get excited about. The campus itself is really an exciting place, the base is an exciting place for its potential, not necessarily for its current state, but for its potential. I'm prepared to vote in favor, and I'm looking forward to further reviews where we will get into more of this and hopefully the detail of it all will satisfy the need for a real vision and aspiration that I feel just'",

I'm not completely aligning myself with Commissioner May's comments, but I appreciate most of them in the spirit in which he's suggesting something that looks more aspirational. Which I guess I wasn't necessarily expecting to be inspired by this plan, but I can see where he's coming from. I appreciate particularly the comments that indicate that they are working on a more robust and definitive climate resiliency plan. One of the things that I didn't hear anything about, or if I did or if they did talk about it, I didn't hear it, anything about transportation. Did I miss that? I don't know.

I'm really interested in seeing what the Installation Facilities Standards are going to look like, which I think will be of great interest to the Commission. I think those are my comments. I really appreciate the work that they're doing. Maybe it could be a little bit more aspirational to join with my colleague.

I'll talk to the staff and get a little more information on that. Remember, we talked a lot about it when we were taking the tour about ways in which we saw opportunities for improvement on managing transportation and parking and also bicycles as an expanding opportunity.

It was really important to see it. It's a real gem. There are some passages -- you can't beat the location, flood potential notwithstanding. Wow. What a location. And on the ground, experiencing it really brought that home. Those are the nice things I have to say. I have to align myself, unsurprisingly, with Commissioner May. But I think the word I would use is not so much that it falls short in aspiration, but the plan to me falls short in imagination and does feel a little bit like a box-checking enterprise.

Unless you start way out of the realm of what you think is possible, in a good way, in an aspirational way, in an imaginative way, it's going to get watered down in the process. So reach further than you think you can attain. That's what I would say. And take advantage of the fact that you have this exercise to do and correct some of the ham-fisted stuff that's been done over the years. Nobody's responsibility who's working on the plan now, but I was so struck by some lovely passages, lovely moments in the campus. And then at the very end -- I think it was I guess is referred to as the parade ground.

Stuff like that was all over the campus. Again, this is a huge opportunity to undo some of the damage that has been wrought over the years by thoughtless -- well, the lack of planning. Again, a box-checking kind of thing, well, we need to meet this need, and we need to meet this program, and this is the fastest, cheapest way to do it. So I wish you luck.

I'd like to associate myself with Commissioner May and Commissioner Wright's comments that there's nothing in here that excites me, but I really hope that imagination can really come through as the future plans come through. This is such a unique site. It's, I think, probably 2 percent of the District's footprint is this site and there's a lot of opportunities for better transportation networks, better walkability, better integration with the city. I think that looking at opportunities to make this feel more like a city within a city than a suburb within a city that it kind of feels like right now. I think that those'",

I hope that as the planning goes forward that we really recognize this for what it is, a fairly unique, very large military installation in the heart of a very dense urban area. I'm not going to vote against or anything like that, but to echo the others, I hope that there's a lot of imagination and good planning work that goes into the future documents that we'll be taking a look at.'",

The last time I was there was 1973, and I imagine it is very different now. But I found it to be a good plan, and I will be voting for it.

So we're eager to hear how that comes forward. I also appreciate the comments from Colonel Logan about the commitment to the environment and recognizing that this is a very special spot and we're eager to hear, as you work through the plan, how that comes forward.

    "7. MONUMENTAL CORE STREETSCAPE DESIGN GUIDELINES": [
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'Good afternoon, Chair White and members of the Commission. NCPC is presenting the draft Monumental Core Streetscape Design Guidelines, vertical and surface elements and requesting authorization to release for a 90- day public comment period. The purpose of today's presentation is to provide a brief recap of the Monumental Core Streetscape and to present the draft streetscape guidelines. We'll review the vertical element guidelines including streetlights and trees, and surface element guidelines including landscapes and plantings, stormwater water management, pavements and pedestrian circulation. And then discuss our current work and next steps to advance the guide and manual development. Now, I'll provide a quick recap on the project background. The Streetscape Manual was first created in 1992 and consists of details and specifications that coordinate construction across federal and local jurisdictions in the National Mall and vicinity. Agencies both used the Manual's details and hold regular working group meetings to'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'coordinate streetscape projects. This is important for developing streetscape consistency across jurisdictions as projects are implemented. Additionally, NCPC and CFA staff used the Streetscape Manual during project review to ensure projects used consistent elements and materials. The current interagency working group includes 11 federal and local agencies listed on the left who signed the MOU to advance components of the Monumental Core Streetscape Project. These project components are being developed in close coordination with the working group and with input from agency experts such as arborists and lighting designers. The Monumental Core Streetscape project is a multi-faced update of the 1992 Streetscape Manual, and it's led by NCPC. The project includes four components shown on the left. First, developing the urban design streetscape framework and lighting policy. Second, developing streetscape design guidelines. Third, updating the construction manual. And fourth, updating our working group MOU. These components will be packaged into'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'a new streetscape guide and manual to inform the future character and civic quality of streetscapes and improve connections between the downtown Monumental Core and surrounding local areas. In November 2019, we received your comments on Item Number 1, the urban design streetscape framework and lighting policy. The Commission commented favorably and directed staff to use this as the basis to develop streetscape design guidelines and any future updates to the Streetscape Construction Manual. To recap, this is the urban design streetscape framework showing street categories including radiating and edging streets in bright pink, which are nationally significant and symbolic. And connecting and traversing streets in light pink, which are nationally and locally significant. This map also shows the streetscape guide and manual boundary, which was expanded to add Banneker Park, the Kennedy Center and surrounding areas in the E Street northwest corridor. I'll note regarding the boundary and the'",

DOWKER': 'relationship between the downtown Monumental Core and surrounding city, the Commission of Fine Arts commented that major axial and diagonal roadways should emphasize continuity beyond the boundary and that the boundary edge may suggest locations of significant thresholds. Our work includes two parts, inside and outside the boundary. Inside the boundary, the interagency working group is developing a new streetscape guide and updating the current manual. Outside the boundary, we signed an MOU with District Department of Transportation and D.C. Office of Planning. This coordination is important for developing guidance for key streets that transition between federal and local areas. This work will be packaged into the companion streetscape for you guide. Overall, this streetscape framework and lighting policy strengthens the city views, supports streetscape consistency, reinforces unique precincts and improves connections and relationships with the downtown Monumental Core and surrounding local areas. (Audio interference) streetscape treatments. Now, I'll present'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'the streetscape design guidelines for vertical and surface elements. The Streetscape Guide and Manual includes many different components within the streetscape as shown here. As a reminder, the streetscape framework categorizes these into vertical, surface, and small scale elements and organizes them along a spectrum of consistency dependent on street category. Generally, most consistency is desired among the vertical and surface elements, which shapes streetscape corridors, frame vistas and important character. Generally, more variability is permitted at the bottom among small scale elements which reinforce character and neighborhood identity. These principles coordinate with the urban design streetscape framework street categories to develop high and moderate streetscape consistency on radiating, edging, connecting and traversing streets. Today, we'll focus on the vertical and surface element guidelines and briefly discuss our next steps on small scale elements. First, I'll present the vertical elements. These are highlighted yellow and include streetlights and trees which'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'shape streetscape corridors and framed vistas. I'll begin with the streetlight guidelines. Streetlights are important because they express the framework of the capital city and provide nighttime illumination for safety as well as ambience and character. We've organized the guidelines into the bulleted topics listed here. I'll note the following guidelines focus on streetlight fixture types, not the quality of light emitted from the streetlights. Lighting quality was broadly addressed in the lighting policy. As a reminder, the Commission commented favorably in the lighting policy and directed staff to use this to inform any future amendments to the Streetscape Manual streetlight specifications and our coordination with the District's Smart Streetlighting Project, which focuses on converting all of the City's streetlights to LED. The current Streetscape Manual specifies the Washington Globes which are found throughout the city and Olmsted lights located exclusively on the Mall. Our work documents a more diverse'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'streetlight fixture palette and the existing range of pole heights. These height details will be necessary to update the streetlight specifications in the future. We also expanded the streetlight palette to include existing special streetlight fixtures, for example, the Pennsylvania Avenue tiered suite of lights. We worked with federal and local partners to develop the proposed guidance, which adds details including the fixture heights and spatial configurations. And I'll call your attention to the orange dots on the mall that indicate potential future crosswalk lighting fixtures, which I'll discuss next. To further the City's Vision Zero goals and to address concerns about inadequate lighting on the National Mall, we developed recommendations to improve mall panel crosswalk lighting. We worked with federal and local partners to develop recommendations that balance pedestrian safety and historic preservation. Specifically, maintaining the dimly lit character of the nighttime east-west vista along the Mall's center panel.'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'In summary, guidelines support streetlight fixtures that unifies city streets, express the dignity of the federal city, highlight unique areas and achieve a consistent palette on the National Mall while improving crosswalk lighting. Next, I'll discuss the tree guidelines. Trees are important because they frame vistas, structures and open spaces and provide an array of environmental benefits. We've organized the guidelines into the bulleted topics here, and I'll highlight a few. The current Streetscape Manual specifies disease-resistant American elms in the street shown here in dark blue. This guidance does not address contemporary trends in our horticulture which call for species biodiversity and improve resilience to pests and disease. Our work focuses on the spatial quality of the tree canopy and how trees shape streetscape character, viewsheds, vistas. In response to CFA's comments, we're broadening the tree palette, considering tree health and recognizing trees as a complex system of living'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'organisms. To improve tree canopy biodiversity and resilience, the guidelines promote consistent tree forms and mature heights to clearly frame view corridors to important structures and open spaces. Focusing on tree form rather than a species broadens the tree palette on many Monumental Core streets. This also minimizes the American elm and similar trees to the Mall where historic preservation is of highest importance. To expand the tree canopy in the Monumental Core and achieve the City's objective, a 40 percent canopy cover by 2032, we looked at historic tree plans that call for multiple rows of trees and develop guidance that encourages restoring a more robust canopy on these streets by working with federal and local partners and stakeholders. We also addressed tree box treatments. Current tree box protections have limited functionality for stormwater management in areas with high pedestrian foot traffic. To expand tree box functionality and improve'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'visual consistency and document existing conditions including historic landscapes, the guidelines include bioretention tree boxes and identify a suite of visually compatible tree boxes based on streetscape and landscape character and pedestrian volumes. In summary, guidelines support increasing tree canopy cover, selecting trees that reinforce streetscape views and improves the pedestrian experience, improving biodiversity in tree health and enhancing human health. Next, I'll present the surface elements which enhance vistas and (audio interference.) These are highlighted in orange and include landscapes and plantings, stormwater management, pavements and pedestrian circulation. First, I'll discuss the landscape and planting guidelines. Landscapes and plantings are important because they unify streetscape character, enhance vistas and provide environmental benefits. We've organized the guideline into the bulleted topics here, and I'll highlight a few. The current streetscape manual specifies a limited landscape and planting palette consistency of mulch, tree plantings and turf grasses. To establish a unified'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'vision, proposed guidance identifies landscape character based on land uses and setting, sidewalk configurations and degree of vegetated and tree- planted open spaces. To enhance streetscape vistas and improve ecosystem health and biodiversity, proposed guidance identifies vegetation heights, generally shorter heights on radiating and edging streets, and taller heights and connecting and traversing streets and supports a great diversity of plantings to include native and pollinator- friendly plants. In summary, guideline support enhancing streetscape and landscape character and improving soils for healthy trees and vegetation and promoting native and pollinator-friendly plants. Next, I'll discuss the stormwater management guidelines. Stormwater management is important because it improves environmental quality, filters pollutants and reduces strain on existing infrastructure. We've organized the guidelines into these bulleted topics, and I'll highlight a few. The current Streetscape Manual only addresses catch basins and inlets. It does not provide guidance on current stormwater management best practices and'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'techniques including green infrastructure. Stormwater management guidelines respond to CFA's comments, which advised staff to consider contemporary environmental issues such as the impact of extreme weather and localized flooding. Guidelines also expand on comprehensive plan policies and coordinate with federal and local stormwater regulations. To address contemporary environmental issues and incorporate best management practices, or BMPs, proposed guidance identifies appropriate locations for stormwater BMPs based on urban design considerations. BMPs are largely encouraged and only limited in certain areas for visual historic preservation or functional reasons. In summary, guideline support using BMPs to address flooding and water quality issues and to meet federal and local standards and regulations, protecting historic and cultural resources and aesthetic character, and ensuring proper stormwater facility maintenance. Next, I'll discuss the pavement guidelines. Pavement is important because it conveys streetscape character and facilitates circulation. We've organized these guidelines into these bulleted topics, and again I'll'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'highlight a few. (Audio interference)the current sidewalk, pavement and curb and gutter types in our area. Our work focuses on unifying pavement character, recognizing special areas, considering transitions on and off the mall and addressing environmental issues. To address pavement character, proposed guidance carries forward the intent to use exposed aggregate on many Monumental Core streets and identifies for custom pavements, highlights special and historic areas, and reflects a more diverse palette that exists today. In summary, guideline support unifying Monumental Core, pavement character, enabling comfortable movement, simplifying material transitions and joints, improving stormwater management, and mitigating heat and wind effect. Next, I'll discuss the pedestrian circulation guidelines. These guidelines are important because they inform the space needed for comfortable and inviting pedestrian circulation. We've organized these guidelines into these bulleted topics, and I'll highlight a few. The current Streetscape Manual addresses roadway classifications and identifies pedestrian ways, but it'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'does not provide guidance on minimum space needed for pedestrians or how other modes interact with pedestrian space. By comparison, the District has guidance for sidewalk width and space needed for pedestrian circulation. Additionally, since pedestrians as well as bicycles and other micromobility modes such as dockless scooters use the multi-use trails on the National Mall, more guidance is needed regarding how other modes interact with pedestrian space. To address space needed for pedestrians and better convey how these spaces are utilized, proposed guidance identifies minimum widths for sidewalks and pedestrian-clear zones and identifies designated multi-use trails and restricted access roads. Our guidance focuses on pedestrian circulation, not transportation or curbside management, but our guidance does address how pedestrians, bicycles, scooters, and other micromobility interact on sidewalks, pedestrian paths and multi-use trails. This guidance is coordinated with federal and local plans and regulations. In summary, guidelines support enhancing circulation for'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'safe, comfortable and enjoyable pedestrian movement. Providing access to unique destinations and events. Ensuring consistent alignment and adequate size of pedestrian space. And coordinating spaces with other streetscape zones and travel modes. In summary, the vertical and surface elements guide streetscape design character and physical quality including the placement configuration and type of streetscape elements. Here are some examples of how our guidance comes together in an illustrative street section. This is a radiating and edging street example of Constitution Avenue NW, showing the double row of vase or spreading-shaped trees, twin twenty streetlights and unified plantings and surface materials. This is a connecting and traversing street example of 12th Street SW showing the single row of round-shaped trees and Washington Globe lights. Now, I'll discuss our current work and next steps, which are continue guideline development for small-scale elements, initiate the construction manual update, and advance collaboration with the'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'City on the Companion Streetscape Review Guide. As a reminder, the streetscape framework guides identifies the importance of streetscape consistency across character areas, which have their own unique identity and are shown here in color. As we develop small-scale element guidelines, we'll identify elements within the right-of-way that are important for supporting streetscape consistency and unique character area identity. We'll address furnishings and civic infrastructure for furnishings such as benches and trash receptacles. We'll focus on updating these elements to meet current needs and standards and for civic infrastructure such as fire hydrants and drinking fountains. We'll focus on addressing current technologies such as car charging stations. I'll note that the Small-Scale Element Guidelines will inventory existing parameter security but will not specify or prescribe parameter security elements or designs. As we update the Construction Manual, we'll begin with pavements for roadway curb and gutter and sidewalks. And in the'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'future, we'll update the federal LED streetlight specifications in coordination with DDOT's Smart Streetlighting Project. As mentioned at the beginning of the presentation, our work is broken into two parts, inside and outside the Streetscape Guide and Manual boundary. Outside the boundary, we're working with the District to develop a Companion Streetscape Review Guide for key streets that transition between federal and local areas. We're currently developing pilot streetscape guidelines for three streets, 16th Street NW north of the White House, South Capitol Street and Massachusetts Avenue. And we're meeting with stakeholders this month to seek their input on draft guidelines. In conclusion, the Monumental Core has beautiful, inviting and functional streetscapes, and we're putting guidance in place to more consistently achieve this level of quality. The new Streetscape Guide and Manual will be used to achieve streetscape consistency across jurisdictions and inform NCPC and CFA staff review. It is'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': 'the Executive Director's recommendation that the Commission authorizes the release of the vertical and surface element guidelines for a 90-day public comment period, commends the interagency working groups collaborative efforts, supports the boundary editions, finds that the guidelines build upon the streetscape framework and notes the importance of using the framework principles to inform the guidelines, notes that the guideline principles are important, directs staff to use the guidelines to inform the construction manual update, and encourages the working group to use the draft guidelines to inform projects. Regarding the Companion Streetscape Review Guide, the Commission notes NCPC's collaboration with the District, finds that this work is important for improving streetscape transitions between the Monumental Core and local neighborhoods, and reinforces CFA's comments regarding the relationship between the Monumental Core and surrounding city. That concludes my presentation, and I'm happy to answer any questions.'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Great.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' In reviewing the draft, the EDR, that was sent over. I noticed safety was mentioned a few times, but it seemed like it's more like pedestrian safety, but it's more in the context of streetlights and intersections. Is there discussion in here or in the accompanying manuals that eventually come out of design for pedestrian safety, especially in the Monumental Core?'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': ' No. What you saw in the guide was probably in reference the crosswalk lighting improvements. That's where we've been made aware that there are some issues with regards to nighttime visibility of pedestrians in the crosswalks. And as your comment relates to the pedestrian circulation guidelines, again, we're really relying on federal and local transportation plans to target those issues and coordinating where we can.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Great, thanks. I'll have a few more comments, but that's very helpful.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Any other questions for Ms. Dowker?'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Ms. Koster, was that you speaking?'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': ' It is. One, Meghan, if you could take your PowerPoint presentation down. I just wanted to note we've been having a little bit of audio delay with your presentation, so you may want to go off. As much as we like seeing you, you may want to go off camera to see if that helps with the sound quality a little bit.'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': ' Thank you. That's a very helpful suggestion.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner Wright, you had a question?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I do. And I should know the answer, but I don't. Does the manual or will the manual include maintenance? Like recommendations for consistent checks once the streetscapes are installed? It's not probably in the purview of the manual, but some mention of it might be a good thing.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Ms. Dowker?'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': ' Yes. Thank you for the question. So the current manual includes a limited maintenance section primarily for maintaining trees. This is something that we've discussed at length with the working group. We are including a maintenance section specifically for the stormwater since those facilities in particular do require additional maintenance.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Okay. That's what I was thinking of. When we put in these low-impact developments at first, some of them have been less than successful. And unless they're checked often -- especially for new installations, it's important to make sure they work because we have a tendency to just finish the work and move on to the next project. So some kind of section on that, however brief, would be a good thing.'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Okay, yes. (Audio interference.) I wonder whether there was any discussion here about the 5G that the District is planning to, I think, make part of its installation on lights and also whether the maintenance issue is there also. That does happen -- I believe the carriers will be responsible for maintaining their 5G equipment if they are going to be included in the lighting process.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Another good question. Ms. Dowker?'",
        "'MS. DOWKER': ' Yes, thank you. We are including small cell antennas into the topic of civic infrastructures. So that is something that will advance in our next phase of work.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I just want to be sure that the maintenance that Commissioner Wright brought up also connects to this because carriers get in, they do something and maybe they don't have a success and then they need the gear, and it's kind of like the cables that hang all around our streets because they don't want to take them down once people disconnect their TVs or their cable.'",

I also appreciate the fact that staff reached out and gave me a bit of a pre-brief on this given the extent of Park Service's interests are involved. I don't really have any specific comments. I will just say that this is a very important, if often overlooked, document. It is something that all federal agencies should be looking to as we continue to maintain the Nation's Capital in the condition that we want it to be. I think that it's also the sort of thing that isn't really that noticeable to most people. They don't really see and understand how much thought goes into things like light fixtures or park benches or what have you, but it is the streetscape. I think that's the reason why it goes'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'unnoticed is that it's all very good. It's not perfect. There's certainly lots of room for improvement, but I think that the fact that we've had this manual before and that we will continue to have the guidelines, and manual and there will be further instructions, if you will, coming from it. I think it will help guide the development and maintenance of the streetscape for a long time to come. I'm not sure how soon we'll have to revisit it, and there are some concerning things that are out there like small cell technology, but optimistic that it's on a good course and this is sort of a good basic guidebook for how we operate the properties in the (audio interference).

Particularly happy that the City's plan, and I'm assuming our effort too, will allow the monitoring of lights that don't work and, therefore, they hopefully will be fixed and work because in certain neighborhoods, in my community, lighting is very important to safety. There was a time when the police department would keep records of lights being out so that the Pepco or whoever could turn them back on again or fix them, that dropped, and it was sort of up to the community to do this. I've spent many a night out wrapping yellow ribbons around poles and asking the City come in and correct them, and this will eliminate that need. And it's very important. It's a safety issue. I'm glad that this will hopefully address that. Thank you.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Thanks so much. As I alluded to earlier, I think that pedestrian safety has been an increasing concern in the District -the mayor, our Vision Zero goals, and everything going around with that. There's been a lot of work on kind of the non-federal streets in D.C. to either put up bollards to reconfigure roads to reduce the lanes to slow the cars down. Some of this have been more effective than others, but I just think that in moving this more forward and to looking at the design manual, maybe we think about some trends that have been going on. I mean, there's some talk in the presentation about the possible lighting that was mentioned earlier at certain pedestrian crosswalks, but I think there are other things to be considered in translating this over, just to have more emphasis on safety. I never thought that I'd say anything good'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'about the design of L'Enfant Plaza, but I will say it's the only federal area that I know of that actually has raised crosswalks at several of the intersections that keep the sidewalk at the pedestrian level and cause the cars to slow down a little bit to go over those speed humps. I think that to the extent in taking these kind of priorities and to talk about how it is we want to design roads down here in the Downtown Core. Things like the bike lanes on Pennsylvania Avenue probably made things a bit safer in many ways because it slows the traffic down by taking those lanes away. But despite that there have still been some fatal accidents along Pennsylvania Avenue with buses taking turns too fast. I think that this guide maybe had more of an emphasis on ways that the design downtown can work to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'make it a better pedestrian experience, especially down around the Mall. Maybe we should be putting some speed tables where the National Mall crosses over -- what is it, 7th and 9th Street down there. I'll just encourage you as we're taking these principles forward into actual design manuals to think about whatever we can do, especially in the pedestrian-heavy downtown areas where we have a lot of tourists that don't necessarily know how D.C. traffic works. But I want to thank you for the presentation. I think there's a lot of good updates and kind of an emphasis on just good design quality downtown, so I'd like to thank you.'",

I also want to -- as it says in the Executive Director's Report commending our agency work, the work that has gone into this and the simplicity of its presentation and ability to understand what it's doing is very impressive. really appreciate that. I noticed there was one comment on there. I think it said, note that the following things are important for, but you could just stop at the word important because all the elements of this document in how they treat the federal core and then how it expands out and transitions into the local city, they're very important and it's a very successful document.

I do think it's a really great opportunity as we move into the public comment period to really solicit feedback. I agree, it's a really comprehensive effort. I think there's more that all of us can do in furthering the conversation around safety, traffic coning, lighting. The Vision Zero effort, I think has captured people's imagination that help them think about streetscape. I appreciate what Commissioner May said about our Nation's Capital and the streetscape is actually quite good, but we have to be vigilant to make sure it stays that way. And the comments around maintenance and trying to encourage folks who are actually negotiating with the private companies, building in those safeguards for making sure that things aren't left behind.

I'd also like to thank the District Department of Transportation and Office of Planning for their collaboration on a Companion Streetscape Guide for axial and radial city streets with important relationships to the Monumental Core, echoing Commissioner Steingasser's comments in that regard. I do want to stress that this work is really important for unifying and achieving consistency on our streets within the downtown Monumental Core and connecting physically and visually with our national buildings, important monuments, our open spaces, but as well as the surrounding local neighborhoods and the rest of the city.

        "'MS. KOSTER': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'All right. Good afternoon, Chair White, and Commission members. Today, I will provide an information presentation on the updates to the Federal Capital Improvements Program, or FCIP for short. During today's discussion, first, I will broadly touch on the FCIP, the enabling legislation and legal framework and requirements, and how the FCIP is used by our Agency, how capital improvement is defined by our agency, as well as financial reporting requirements for projects. And lastly, the FCIP process and scorecard. Next, I will discuss project and mission changes that have occurred as part of this year's program to address new NCPC and administration policies. And lastly, I will close by highlighting the next steps going forward for the program. One of NCPC's core activities under the Planning Act is to prepare the FCIP, which is a six-year program of federal capital improvement projects for the National Capital Region. NCPC uses'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'the FCIP as a planning tool to help guide planning and development in region and evaluates each proposed federal capital project for conformance to NCPC plans and policies. FCIP can be seen as an outlook of capital projects within the National Capital region over the next six years. Each year, we submit the six-year program with planning and finding recommendations the Office of Management and Budget for use in its preparation of the President's annual budget. I'd like to note because of OMB's Circular Number A-11 regarding pre-decisional information on budget matters, the FCIP report that is submitted to OMB is reviewed in the executive session of the Commission. In the fall, the FCIP-funded report, which is composed of projects that have been proved and received funding within the President's budget in the fiscal year is released to the public. To give the Commission an understanding of the reason why'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'you may see the types of projects that you have historically seen during the Executive Session, I want to provide an overview of what we have defined as a capital improvement project that will be required to submitted for FCIP review. A capital improvement includes acquisition of buildings and lands, construction of new buildings and structures, additions or major alterations of existing buildings and structures, this excludes ordinary repair maintenance such as replacement of HVAC units or paving roads. Capital improvement may include the acquisition of fixed assets, construction of streets, highways or bridges, transportation infrastructure and major utilities. Major site improvements including perimeter security and landscaping projects, fences, and our remediation projects. I wish to note that a capital improvement project is not defined by the source of funding for projects. A project that receives donations or receives internal sources of funding other than appropriated funding from the President's'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'budget may still be considered a capital improvement project. The cost to fund a capital improvement should be calculated based on its whole life cycle cost, including all direct and indirect costs for planning, design and construction of the project. Just a reminder about last year's program that you saw, we had 37 projects that received funding in fiscal year 2021. The total cost was approximately $756 million. The largest funded project in the last fiscal year was the National Institutes of Health Surgery, Radiology, and Laboratory Medicine building -- that's a mouthful -- which topped at $229 million. To prepare the annual FCIP report, federal agencies submit to NCPC a copy of the advance program of capital improvements for the upcoming six years. This year's program includes projects with funding requests for fiscal years 2023 through 2028. The FCIP process is composed of two data calls, the initial and'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'the second, which are timed to give NCPC staff and agency representatives ample opportunity to submit and review capital improvement projects prior to finalizing the report. The FCIP process ends in July when the final FCIP report that is submitted to OMB is reviewed by the Commission at the July meeting. Following that meeting, recommendations are forwarded to OMB. In September, following the release of the President's budget, NCPC releases the FCIP- funded report to our website, which provides details on projects that were funded within the President's budget that particular fiscal year. Just to go over the scorecard, NCPC uses the FCIP project scorecard to evaluate a project's consistency or policies in the Federal Elements, NCPC-approved master plans, site and building plans and other plans and policies. The projects are evaluated with a consistency to each category and score a green, yellow, red or not applicable rating and then'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'get an overall rating. Projects with an overall green rating are generally consistent with NCPC's policies and plans. Yellow ratings are often for projects that need additional information to determine consistency with plans and policies or impacts associated with that project, and commonly many of these projects are at the earlier stages or concept stage of planning. They do not have all the information fully ascertained to be able to score the project as a green. A red rating means often a project has major inconsistencies with Agency plans and policies or there are unresolved adverse impacts. There are a couple of changes that have been made to the FCIP submission and review process for this year's cycle. The most pronounced change was the inclusion of additional questions that ask applicant agencies how they are mitigating climate risks and advance the equity and support of underserved communities. Last year, the'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'Commission was presented with a finalized Climate Action Plan and an overview of the Agency's Equity Action Plan. As discussed, last year during their respective presentations. These plans seek to advance the goals and policy as outlined in Executive Order 14008 in case of climate change and Executive Order 13985 in the case of equity. Within the Climate Action Plan, the FCIP was identified as a tool that can enhanced to help applicant agencies identify climate opportunities and challenges and to work with them to meet NCPC and federal goals for sustainability, adaptation and resiliency planning. In the case of the Equity Action Plan, the FCIP was identified as a useful tool to engage with federal applicant agencies on how their capital improvement projects may impact undeserved communities and discuss ways in who to reduce potential disparities and eliminate barriers. The questions that were created attempt to advance goals of'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'both of these action plans. Under the Planning Act, the final customer for the FCIP report is the Office of Management and Budget, which uses the FCIP for its budget considerations as OMB views the FCIP solicitation process is a key source of information to gauge how applicant agencies are complying with the executive orders. NCPC staff worked with OMB to draft and finalize the questions for inclusion in this year's FCIP submission process. I will note that these questions are required fields and must be completed by applicant agencies prior to submission of any project for FCIP review. To discuss the climate change questions, they are again informed by both the Climate Action Plan and Executive Order 14008. The questions are arranged into six different categories within the four. The first category asks if a project is incorporating renewable energy resources into its design. The questions or the types'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'of energy sources range from solar panels, wind, geothermal, biomass, biogas or low-impact hydropower, or if the project is meeting net zero energy principles. The second category seeks to understand if a project is implementing water conversation measures by incorporating applicable technology and equipment into their plans and design of the project. Another question to applicants is on how the project may reduce stormwater runoff and contain that runoff onsite. The third category of questions seeks to understand how a project may reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including net zero emissions principles such as retrofits, if it's for a renovation project or incorporation of new technology for new construction projects. The fourth category asks if the project would meet green building design standards and would allow applicants to explain the building standards chosen and ways it would achieve that certification. The fifth category is related to how a project would be'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'sited to minimize land disturbance. There's a category of questions on how a project may disturb forested lands or wetlands within the project's boundaries and existing site for how a project may adaptively reuse land and installation to mitigate greenfield development. The final category asks applicant agencies questions how a project is designed, considers potential hazards and threats related to climate change such as sea level rise, nuisance flooding as you see in the graphic here along Constitution Avenue in front of the NMAAHC or failing infrastructure in ways that they are incorporating resilient practices to reduce environmental hazards. Moving to the equity questions. The equity questions are informed by the first question within that section. Is your project located within or adjacent to an equity emphasis area as defined by the metropolitan Washington Counsel of Government, or COG. As illustrated here is a map of the equity emphasis areas,'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'which was presented to you by COG at your January public meeting. Since it's tracked within the region that are considered equity emphasis areas are labeled in orange. We then overlaid that map with the major federal installations within the National Capital region, which are labeled in gray. Using this locational question as a basis, the questions then are categorized into four additional categories. Impacts on underserved communities, which seeks to understand if a project would have impacts within the community where it is located that may relate to traffic, traffic access to the facility within the community or the question is, does it cut off access within the community and create barriers or impacts on natural and cultural resources within the community. Next, we seek to understand how a project design may provide access to all people. This includes how the project is designed and mentions physical security elements'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'including fence and gate placement, interior design of the site. And if the project accommodates multi-mode of transportation opportunities and the project's physical interconnectivity within the surrounding community. The next category is to understand how a project would promote economic development within the community in a myriad of ways such as, would the project create a positive investment within these communities by allowing the support of local businesses, or is designed in a manner that would permit employees to readily support goods and services around the site. Lastly, we seek to understand an agency's plans for community engagement and outreach with undeserved communities adjacent to the project site and ask them to detail the method of that outreach. In closing, I wish to highlight next steps going forward for this year's program and beyond as it relates to the new submission questions. We understand that many agencies are also beginning'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'to address how their projects may be impacted by these orders. NCPC is proposing a phased approach in how questions may be used to evaluate and issue scores for projects. The first phase will occur with this FCIP cycle with the answers to these questions being used as supplemental information for projects but were not formally factored into a project's scorecard. We'll then present a full FCIP report to you in executive session on July 7th. Following the end of this year's FCIP cycle, NCPC will reevaluate questions after receiving feedback from the agency representatives and also engaging with you as a Commission on these questions, as well as our OMB partners, following this year's cycle. We will then refine those questions prior to the next FCIP cycle in December of 2022. The second phase will start when the next fiscal year cycle begins this upcoming December as responses will'",
