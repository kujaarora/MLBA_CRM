Following my presentation the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments will share current economic trends in the region and their planning efforts to update the region's cooperative forecast. Our Commission last adopted a Federal Workplace Element in 2016. In 2019 the Commission released a draft update to the element for public comment. Following that update the pandemic emerged and resulted in immediate changes to the federal workplace. Because of the unknown long-term implications on the workplace in March of 2021 the Commission decided to defer action on further changes to the element and only approved amendments to the boundary and definition of a central employment area to reflect NCPC and the District's joint effort to make the boundary and definition consistent in both the federal and district elements. Since last year we've been'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': 'studying the potential long-term impacts of the pandemic on the workplace and monitoring changes to federal telework and the demand for office space. Today we will provide you an overview of our research and our scenario planning efforts for the Federal Workplace Element. As a reminder, the Federal Workplace Element provides policy guidance to improve the operational efficiency and productivity for the planning, location, design, and operation of federal workplaces. The 2019 draft considered trends and major drivers reshaping the Federal Government's footprint and influencing development in the region, however it did not consider the impacts of the pandemic. The pandemic forced changes to the workplace. Since March of 2020 a significant percentage of the region's federal workforce worked from home. Two years later we're finally at a point where federal agencies are slowly returning to the office, but many to a hybrid work environment. The pandemic has accelerated a'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': 'trend in telework and remote work and permanently changing the way the Federal Government works. Given the uncertainty of how much telework and remote work agencies will adopt in the long term, as part of the element update NCPC decided to consider scenario planning to help identify a range of potential outcomes and impacts. To help with this effort NCPC will partner with COG in the upcoming year to explore scenario planning initiatives to better understand the cumulative impacts of federal telework and hybrid workplaces on our region. This initiative will convene a panel of experts and include facilitated discussions with stakeholders to help identify future scenarios that will be considered for subsequent targeted research. This research may be conducted by consultants as needed. We'll study the use of telework in analyze how that may impact office demand of the federal footprint, the transportation network, and federal procurement. Each scenario'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': 'will be analyzed through the lens of impact on climate and equity. In the next few slides I'll highlight to focus areas and the questions we will study. The Federal Government is the largest single employer in the region. In 2020 federal workforce was 12 percent of the total region's workforce. And if you factor in federal contractors, approximately a quarter of the region's workforce is federally-related. Three percent of federal employees teleworked daily before the pandemic. This increased to 45 percent during the pandemic. So as part of the study will continue to monitor how federal agencies are considering telework and remote work as the workforce reenters the physical workplace. Questions we'll study include what is the demand for telework as federal agencies return? What type of federal jobs have the potential to telework and/or work remotely, and where are these jobs concentrated in the region? 1 2 3'",

Changes to the federal real estate can have a significant impact on the region. Before the pandemic agencies were already prioritizing consolidation of offices and moving workers from leased to federally-owned space. At last month's Commission meeting on the Ft. Belvoir North Area we heard DoD's plans to consolidate out of leased facilities across the National Capital Region into federally-owned space over the next decade. And as of last month there are approximately 484 total GSA leases in the region with 60 percent of the leases set to expire in the next five years. So why does this matter? This just shows us that in the near term many federal agencies will need to reevaluate'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': 'their space needs and decide whether to remain in federally- leased space or relocate in federally-owned, which is a large interest of many jurisdictions. So questions we'll study include how will federal telework and remote work redefine employee space requirements? What is the Federal Government's demand for office space? How will this impact the federal footprint, federal office leases, and federal location decisions including the central employment area, central business areas and COG's equity emphasis areas? The Federal Government is a significant contributor to the trends related to the region's transportation and environmental stewardship. Currently more than half of all Metrorail stations serve federal facilities. Before the pandemic approximately one-third of Metrorail peak period commuters were federal employees. And then earlier this year Metrorail ridership was 20 percent of pre-pandemic levels on weekdays. So the use of telework and remote work will have consequences to commuting patterns and the region's'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': 'transportation network. We're already seeing these changes as federal agencies update their master plans. For example, last year the Commission approved the Goddard Space Flight Center master plan. They plan to reduce the number of facilities by 25 percent, as well as their amount of parking. They plan to decrease their single-occupancy vehicle commuting, which will be offset by increasing the number of employees teleworking from an existing 0.4 percent to a proposed 40 percent. So our study will consider how would federal telework impact the transportation network, transit ridership as well as roadway traffic, and change the region's greenhouse gas emissions? Lastly federal procurement is one of the most importance forces shaping the region's economy. This includes federal spending on acquiring goods and services like design and construction of buildings, building rent and utilities, contracting services, and all other essential workplace items. In 2017 the Federal Government accounted for'",

The workplace may require investment to modernize or renovate existing federal buildings in the future to address changes in office space needs. So our study will consider how would federal procurement changes impact the region's economy and office space? Our next step for this initiative is to finalize the proposal with COG before we start the expert panel discussion and targeted research later this year. NCPC then will summarize the analysis in a key findings report that will be a framework for NCPC, COG, and regional planning directors to make more effective decisions as they consider potential impacts of the future scenarios.

        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'Transportation Planning Board at COG and also to the Montgomery County Council. So again really trying to seed a conversation about the future of the region. What you're looking at here is a schematic of our forecasting process at COG. This is something that our region's planning directors established in the 1970s to come up with a consistent set of growth projections for local and regional planning. Just call your attention to how the process works. In the upper left-hand corner we have an econometric model that determines what is the maximum amount of growth we realistically think from an economic standpoint the region would be seeing over the next 25 or 30 years. The lower left corner, the strength of the process, are the projections that actually come from the local governments. In the near term as you see from permitting, site review, where projects are actually going forward'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'as we speak, and then guided over the long term by comprehensive and small area plans. We reconcile those forecasts. And then the most significant part of this process is the small area projections that go to serve a host of complex transportation models, air quality models, water supply, a range of very technical needs that are widely used. Forecasts are also used locally for capital improvements planning for schools, hospitals, any sort of needs like that. Next slide, please? Very quickly, what do the most recent forecasts show? As you see, we would add about 880,000 jobs over the next 25 years or so, about 1.3 million people, and about 500,000 households. So we are still expecting fairly significant growth on top of the base that does in fact exist. Next slide, please? This slide shows for employment where and the amount of growth that is currently anticipated in'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'the forecasts. The forecasts were arrayed based on the largest number of jobs in the region in 2020, which is the District of Columbia, followed by Fairfax, Montgomery, so forth as you continue down through the list. The lighter portion of each of those bars shows the number of jobs in 2020 and then the darker portion, the dark red if you will, shows the increment of growth that's expected over the next 25 years. Again, you can see the relative rates of growth with the District continuing to be the center of the greatest number of jobs throughout the region, but followed very closely by Fairfax. Something I would point out; and again you can see the relative relationship, if you will, between the dark red and the lighter portion of the bars, we spent a lot of time at the Council of Governments visioning and looking at the'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'future and alternative scenarios. And something that we're always very mindful of and what's seen in these forecasts is that 80 percent of the future, 80 percent of 2045 is already on the ground now. So our ability as planners to influence the future really is constrained by that dark red portion that you see there. Next slide, please? This is obviously the companion to the prior slide. This is the residential forecast, the household projections for the same time period. Again arrayed the same way with Fairfax having the greatest number of housing units in 2020 first, followed again by Montgomery, Prince George's, and throughout the remainder of the region. Again the same pattern where the darker portion of the bar shows the amount of growth in housing units that's expected over the next 25 years. Again, commensurate with what I mentioned before about the household projections, about 80'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'percent of the 2045 households, the residential pattern that we expect in 2045, 80 percent of that is already on the ground now. And that blue portion of each of those bars, the dark blue, is the portion that we can really focus on trying to influence in our planning initiatives. Next slide, please? So I'd like to pivot now, as Angela said, to really a snapshot of where things are now in our region's economy. What you're looking at here is a slide that goes back to December of 2019, immediately prior to the pandemic, the number of jobs in the region, and then continuing to the most recent period on the far right-hand side, February of this year. I'll point out to you that dramatic plunge between March and April of 2020 with the onset of the pandemic. We lost 370,000 jobs, as you can see. It's the'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'greatest loss in employment in this region in any one month period that we have ever experienced. The far right, again you can see we have -- we recovered up to a bit more than 3.2 million jobs, or about 98 percent of the jobs that we had in the region in 2020. So again, we are basically back to where we had been. We have recovered, but what you'll see is the unevenness of that. Next slide, please? This slide shows -- again picking up on the prior slide showing total jobs, this is a breakdown of employment change between March and April of 2020 as the pandemic hit across all the sectors. And what you can clearly see, every job sector in the region lost employment in that one-month period. The most obvious, the most prevalent are those bars towards the center: leisure and hospitality, followed by retail.'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'And then some of the other services: educational and health services. Folks often ask, well, what do I mean by that? Day care centers, child care centers. You all remember two years ago when things literally shut down, it was if someone had pulled the floor out from beneath us. Next slide, please? As I mentioned before, we have recovered. We're at about 98 percent of employment as it was in March of 2020. This bar -- or this chart rather shows how job sectors have recovered across the spectrum. Again we're still short about 35,000 fewer leisure and hospitality jobs and about 25,000 fewer retail jobs with things changing as we are well aware of. Next slide, please? Something we also track at the Council of Governments. This is data from CoStar. We look at subregional office markets. And I'll talk about construction in a moment, but this is'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'looking at vacancy rates. For the fourth quarters of 2019, '20, and '21, as you can see vacancy rates during that period, that three-year period increased throughout with the most rapid increases during calendar year 2021. Northern Virginia experienced the highest vacancy rates; 16.5 percent vacancy rate region -- or I'm sorry, throughout the Northern Virginian subregion, but several markets throughout Metropolitan Washington have consistently had much higher vacancy rates than that. Next slide, please? Something we have been tracking for some time at the Council of Governments, and it has -- as you can see form this particular slide, has been getting a good deal of press as an indicator, if you will, of office occupancy. Kastle Systems is actually a local firm. They're based in Arlington and they provide building security services in the sense that they have the little electronic key cards that you use to access'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'an office or go into a secure area. You swipe and you gain access. They're also the firm that owns the Kastles, the women's tennis firm, or tennis team rather here in the District. Next slide, please? What this slide is showing based on the Kastle System's data is office occupancy trends really going back just the last six months or so. Again, there's data available for a much longer time period, but showing in red how our return to office rate, if you will, compared to the blue bars, which are for the nation, the 10 major metropolitan areas in the country. Again you can see that massive drop off just at the end of the year when the omicron variant hit. We were up to about a 36, a 37 percent office occupancy rate. We have begun the slow return. But most significantly for this region as a'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'whole we are always about two to three points below the average of the 10 major metropolitan areas, consistently ranking really only No. 3 or No. 4 from the bottom of all those 10 metropolitan areas. Next slide, please? I mentioned before that we track commercial construction. This is a slide going back the last 30 years or so showing construction throughout Metropolitan Washington by different structure types: office in purple, the orange for retail, and so forth. Would point out just to the left of this -- I believe it's 1987, if memory serves me, was the year that we produced the greatest amount of space in this region. But as you can see, 1990 was clearly a peak. In 2021 we actually produced about 11 million square feet of space across the region. One thing I would point out to you, again the fact that the trend for'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'commercial space has been declining over the last 20 years or so. I would also call your attention to how the share of office construction, the purple areas shaded in at the bottom of the chart, has declined over time as well. And there was an increase in that turquoise or teal colored share of other space which includes a host of things like data centers. Next slide, please? I mention data centers because they're an increasingly interesting point for commercial construction throughout this region. This is a slide from our most recent summary report for 2020 describing again -- or I'm sorry, showing rather the location of major projects. The red circles, graduated circles by size show the projects that were completed in 2020. The beige areas show the universe of all other projects that were completed before 2020. Again as the slide says, office construction was actually the'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'single largest source of new space during 2020, but again the prevalence or the increasing prevalence, particularly in some of the far suburban jurisdictions of industrial flex space data centers.

Pivoting to some of the other indicators we track in economic trends, what you're looking at here is a slide showing roadway traffic volumes throughout the region, again beginning prior to the pandemic and then through the most recent period, the data available in December. So that second bar on the left-hand side, that is for the -- or the series of bars, I should say, on the left-hand side are for calendar year 2020 through February of '21. What you can clearly see is highway volumes were less than half between March and April -- April was less than half of what highway volumes had been in the prior year of 2019. By December, on the'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'right-hand side for December of 2021 we're back to about 95 percent of highway traffic volumes compared to where December of 2019 volumes were. Next slide, please? We also work very closely with WMATA. What you're looking at here is a chart comparing Metrorail ridership in blue and Metrobus ridership in orange, again going back to January of last year. What you can see again is the disparity, but also on the right- hand side that Metrorail ridership most recently is only at about 30 percent of prior pandemic ridership levels in 2019; Metrobus at about two- thirds of prior ridership levels. Next slide, please? COG is also the host to the National Capital Transportation Planning Board, the TPB. And in 2021 the Transportation Planning Board commissioned a survey of about 3,000 households in the region called Voices of the Region. And what you're looking at here is the results'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'of one of those questions that was posed to householders. And it's a chart of what are the preferences of teleworkers? And what you can clearly see is nearly two-thirds, 65 percent of all of the households that responded said that they would prefer to continue to telework at some level going forward. More than a quarter, 26 percent said they would really like to telework full time going forward and less than 10 percent, about 1 out of every 11 said no, I really want to return to work full time. So a very insightful view into the pulse of workers' thinking on this topic, if you will. Next slide, please? COG also works very closely with George Mason University, the Stephen Fuller Institute. And what you're looking at here is the results of a survey that they commissioned with the Washington Post last summer. It's a bit dated,'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'the timing, if you will, but I would also assert that this is probably a fairly good indicator of the current mind set of many workers in that if we all think back to last summer, we were all fully vaccinated, we thought things were reopening, we were going back to a level of normalcy. What you're looking at again across different age categories is workers' preferences about returning to the office. The light blue portion of the bar shows workers who said that they would mostly like to be back in work on a daily basis. The dark blue, the bottom portion of each bar is the portion of workers who said they would mostly like to telework. I draw your attention to a couple of things: For the region as a whole 48 percent, that first bar, about half of all workers said they would still mostly like'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'to be back in the office, mostly like to be at work. That second group, the 18 to 29-year-olds, 58 percent, nearly three out of five younger workers, that young cohort that we continue to track very, very bright workers of the region, they would largely like to be back in the office. And we can think of a variety of reasons: early stages of your career, but it's also the socialization, the opportunity to meet a potential spouse or partner. So very insightful points and very interesting perspectives when you look at different workers and by their age category. Next slide, please? Companion to this, that Post -- the Post and the Schar School commissioned this snapshot, if you will, from the perspective of movers. The dark blue portion, or the dark blue bars rather of each group show the total number of workers in the region based upon'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'their interests, why they chose to move during the last 12 months or so. The yellow shows the workers -- or the, I'm sorry, the households rather who responded purely based on their perspectives or their need, if you will, from the pandemic. So as you look across the groupings of bars, very traditional rationales for crime safety, education, access to restaurants and so forth. But I would call to your attention to those last two sets of bars for more space, where nearly 70 percent of pandemic-related movers said we just need to move because we need more space and access to the outdoors. Contrast that with the set of bars immediate left of it, proximity to extended family. Folks who had really been locked up during the pandemic, that wasn't really a priority for them when it came to moving. That was probably not what was the rationale'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'for them wanting to in fact pick up and move. Next slide, please? Again as I said we work closely with George Mason. This is a slide actually the source of which is Avant, Avison Young. This looks at the number of commercial office leases that will be expiring by class type over the next four years. Again, you can see to the right the different array. It is nearly 44 million square feet of space that is coming online to be leased going forward, or re- let, if you will. These are spaces that are expiring. I think part of the question -- and when I share this with other groups, it is the question that Angela alluded to, is what will space utilization be like going forward given telework trends, given the proclivity to move to smaller spaces regardless of the size of your workforce? And from a'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'COG perspective, commercial real estate is extremely important from a revenue standpoint. So this is a series of data, a source of information I think really bears watching over the next few years, particularly as these individual leases, and in aggregate, as they are in fact renewed and what sort of premiums, what sort of exactions, if you will, come out of any one of those transactions. Next slide, please? Looking forward COG is spending time looking at a number of different indicators very much along the lines of what Angela alluded to. I won't go into all the detail here, but we have begun the work to develop our next major series, or next major round of forecasts, if you will. About every five years we do put our finger to the wind and look at what are the macroeconomic trends that are driving growth going into the future'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'for the next 25 years of so, that second set of indicators, if you will. What are the COVID-19 impacts to future growth going to be? I've alluded to several of them: commercial space utilization and demographic assumptions. Interestingly enough we've become a tremendously more diverse region with all the wonderful benefits that has brought to the region, and our household size is actually begun to increase slightly. I'll chat about that in just a minute. Next slide, please? Going down very quickly some of the steps we'll go through, we are currently benchmarking our employment to the year 2020, examining Census 2020 trends, how we have matched those estimates with our own projections. As I said, we are developing a new econometric model to really determine what is the baseline, the benchmark forecast for the region? And then we work very closely, as I showed in that schematic, to'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'obtain local forecasts from the member planning departments with their processes and what are the assumptions that they are using to drive their forecasts? Next slide, please? So very quickly, how we intend to accomplish some of this is we have actually engaged a consultant through the Transportation Planning Board to look at a couple of key indicators as we in fact develop this vision of our future for the region. That first bullet we're actually asking that they would help us put their finger on the pulse, look at some of the key drivers, if you will, that might create a range of regional economic forecasts. As I said, we talked about office demand changing, patterns of job growth by sector, but really to balance the forecast with some confidence of what might an alternative future be that might be slightly higher or slightly lower. The other trends that'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'we're asking them to look at in that second bullet is a couple of things on the demographic side. As I mentioned, the change in average household size. In the 1970s and 1980s average household size plummeted when Baby Boomers deferred having children. As we mentioned before, we have benefited from tremendous immigration to this region. We continue to attract extremely bright and talented workers across the spectrum and our average household size has begun to increase slightly. Why is that important? At the local level that factors into things like the need for schools, services, hospitals, public safety, and so forth. We talked about office space utilization, but also retail space demand. We all know the impact, how we've become very comfortable with home deliveries from a retail standpoint. Here are ITE standards for how many -- how much square footage you need for an office worker or for'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'retail space. We believe both of those are changing going forward. And again, that change, the demand based on the number of workers equates to the demand for the space that would be needed to house them for their occupations. And then lastly, that last point, I believe when I came to the Commission three years ago I shared with you our work with the local governments on the need for more housing in the region. We're all aware of how expensive housing has become, the tight markets that we have experienced. Something we were very much interested in, particularly with the advent of broadband, telework policies, and so forth, what would the potential spatial impacts be to the timing and location of future housing in the region and beyond? The COG footprint is fairly small, but we do in fact model two, three, four tiers of counties beyond our'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'footprint and we do already see on an occasional basis commuters from very, very far distances from the COG footprint. Next slide, please? Then lastly, wrapping up, again adapted from my colleague Terry Clower at George Mason, these are some of the key points that we have been talking about within the Council of Governments and with some of the other audiences that I've had the privilege to share this with. Obviously inflation, interest rates, where are we with the pandemic, that fifth bullet that no one would have possibly anticipated; conflicts domestically, but internationally, the impacts of federal spending throughout the region, but across the region as legislation and spending authorizations move forward. On the right-hand side these are some of the key drivers that we see that are clearly more locally-focused. We've talked for many years at the Council of Governments about our ability to attract and retain'",
        "'MR. DESJARDIN': 'the talented workers that we want for the jobs that we are creating. But as you can see there it is also the challenge that I mentioned before about the need for affordable housing. Again, work from home, telework, that does influence both the number of workers as well as their place of residence and how flexible can we as employers be where this is in fact still a bit of an uncertainty going forward? So thank you. Those really are all the comments I have to share. If time permits, I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone might have. Thank you. Angela?'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': ' Thank you, Paul. And thank you, Commissioners. This concludes our presentation for today. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Well, thank you, Ms. Dupont and Mr. DesJardin. It's just fascinating to see this work and we really appreciate the presentation. Do the Commissioners have any questions?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I do.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Okay. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes, I have a couple of questions. One -- well, it starts with a comment which explains my question. Well, I don't know. Anyway, there's a couple of things that I'm -- you say that the audience for this thing is -- includes -- well, is it a given that the audience for this will be -- or it's federal landholding agencies and that's why you don't mention them? Because you say this is for regional planners. And I'm assuming since it's the federal planning agency that you're including the landholding agencies as your target audience? Right?'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': ' That is correct.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Okay. So, and they will also I assume inform your -- I mean, I'm assuming that you're going to -- this won't be like a spreadsheet exercise. You're going to be interviewing people and getting their take on the ground as they engage in portfolio planning. Right? Yes?'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': ' That's correct. It will be critical for us to work closely with GSA, DoD, other federal agencies with large campuses. And we're going to have these facilitated stakeholder discussions, so there's going to be a lot more discussions, not just a spreadsheet.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes, okay. So that brings me to my third question, and then I'll just roll right into a comment to sort of connect it. Are you going -- you say -- so you're going to I assume have a -- you're going to contract -- you're going to have a contractor who's going to be kind of running the show, process-wise?'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': ' We're still going to be working through COG with the proposal to see what pieces we may need a contractor for some of the targeted research, but that's still to be determined.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Yes, so here's what I'm getting at: You're going to talk to a lot of people who are either SES or they're going to -- or maybe even Schedule C people who are not going to want to admit that they don't really know. So I would -- they don't know what's going to happen. We all -- I mean, people who are honest don't know and -- but you're going to need to give them a safe space to feel like they're talking to you in -- with -- you're going to have to extend some confidentiality if you want to get legit data because nobody wants to say, well, shoot, we're putting together our budget ask and we don't really know. And so if you get a whole lot of -- you're going to get a lot of bravado. And that's not very useful for this assignment, so'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'I would really spend some time thinking through how you're going to offer -- how you're going to create trust with the people that you interview and guarantee a certain amount of confidentiality so that the integrity of the data you do collect is reliable.'",
        "'MS. DUPONT': ' That's very helpful. Thank you so much. And we'll definitely do that. And just note, you know, I think we have an understanding that we may not be able to predict what all agencies are going to be deciding in the near and long term, but part of the scenario of planning work is to identify potential scenarios that could happen and what some of those implications could be, if we were to see several agencies move in that direction.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'And one more thing: You might consider extending this out a little bit and not necessarily make -- putting a lot of pressure on yourself to produce. And here's why: Because people are starting to go back and it's going to be at least six months before -- what we're doing -- what we're saying to ourselves is we -- like everything form -- in good design form follows function. And in this case function is employee behavior. And people's experiences as they go back over just the next few months, over -- and because we're -- it's springtime we're going to be -- and then there's summer vacations and all that. Reliable -- you won't be able to have a real picture of employee behavior, the driver. I mean, the employees, the workforce is in the driver's seat now. And I would just urge that you give it more'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'than a glimpse. And I think it's going to take a minimum of six months for behavior patterns to start stabilizing, at least, and possibly into next year as people kind of search for their groove. And certainly for the people who have kids, the summer will be again an anomalous data set because kids aren't in school and that tends to kind of make things a little bit less typical. Okay. I'll shut up now.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Commissioner Cozart?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'So thank you for this presentation. Definitely thank you, Paul, for that great information, and I think it helps to contextualize the study. And very excited to work with you all on this analysis. As you can imagine, the District has a vested interest as it relates to this, especially underscoring our support for the 60-40 policy. And I think that this analysis is going to help us understand kind of the new world that we're in and what that means for that policy. And I would say, just background, as part of our work to update the Comp Plan we looked at this and had conversations with NCPC about it and found that on -- as it relates to supply, there's lots of places where we're making investments underway now and planned investments in places that are going to be great locations for federal facilities, and we want to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'maintain that commitment. So we're really excited about this proposed analysis, excited that it's happening, thinking that these are the right partners, and stand ready to talk about sites and supplies to the extent that that's helpful for this. And really interested in finding ways to support federal agencies in their location decisions in the District, and supporting kind of the needs and recognizing the timelines, and understanding that we're in this place, as Commissioner Wright said, of unpredictability, and interested to learn from that, and figure out how we can be supportive as a municipality. So thank you so much. Excited for the invitation to engage this way and looking forward.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. I'd like to open it up now to the Commission for discussion. So I'd ask everyone to turn on their cameras. I'll do this again in round robin format. I don't want to miss anyone. And I was going to start with Commissioner Wright. So I just want to check in. Any further comments, Commissioner Wright, for discussion?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' No, I kind of got it all done at once.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Very thoughtful, as always. Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Yes, I'd like to just thank everyone for the presentation and associate myself with Commissioner Wright's comments.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' I'll also just echo some of Commissioner Wright's comments. I know that here on the Council we're going through the budget process right now where we bring in each agency and the Council asks them do you have what you need? And of course the answer is oh, the mayor's budget is the perfect thing; we don't need anything else. So I think there's -- if you're going to look at this issue that I think is very complex, I think that kind of that confidentiality and making sure that you're getting an unvarnished opinion is the way to go because otherwise I think that agency agendas could come into play. So I think that there's a lot of usefulness in looking at this.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Davis?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' Thanks very much for the presentation; it was really informative. Really appreciate hearing more perspectives on what workers are looking for in the future of work and the future of federal property. We'll be sure to continue to follow up looking into this. And I appreciate the presentation.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cozart, any further comments you'd like to share?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' No, not at this time. And as a matter of protocol I'm going to figure out the difference between a question and a comment between now and your next meeting. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Oh, not a problem at all. It's just good to get questions out, and it might reflect on when you want to make a comment later. So it's all very helpful, however you want to do it. Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'Okay. Thanks. Great presentation; great comments. The only thing I would add as we look at this thing -- and obviously part of the discussion kind of hinted at will be this -- how each agency is looking at the distinction between leased facilities and owned facilities and land and how that impacts their plans. Certainly, Paul, your survey about various age groups and where they want to be working in the future is probably something that maybe wasn't obvious to a lot of us until you put that slide up there. And so certainly I think part of your conversation as you go around is not just talk to all of us planners and facility managers, but try and reach out to some of the human capital and leaders in each agency because a large part of this is going to be how they are driving to follow OPM'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'guidance and president's guidance, especially for federal agencies, new telework policies and how they're handling that and how they are leading their workforces to make that happen. I think there will be a lot of people in DoD -- I might take this slide deck back -- that that slide you presented about the 48 percent of people wanted to come back to work is going to be a bit of a surprise based on some of the things we're seeing. So I'm looking forward to participating in and working on this project over the next year or two. The other part, and we hit this thing, is whatever solution we come up as we look at those facility solutions, I think we all understand that implementing those solutions is not a very quick process. It just takes time even with funding to actually implement the changes we need to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'make at facilities to accommodate this new workforce. Thank you, Chair.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Thank you. I don't think I have much to add. I appreciate the comments that have already been made, including Commissioner Wright in particular. Yes, I mean, it's hard to -- it's just so hard to understand how you can navigate this. It's like it's a ship navigating a fog or -- I don't know, if you're a sci-fi person it's like ingesting the spice so you know how to navigate through interstellar space. I don't know, it is a challenging undertaking. And I appreciate all that you're trying to do. It is just so hard. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': 'Yes, I had just a couple of things: I think it was slide 27. I was -- and you don't even have to go back and look at it now, but I was curious if there wasn't an element to deal with commuting and transportation in that slide. That was one comment. And in some of the forecasting models is -- and this may sound naive, but how -- what -- it's about forecasting something like COVID and the nature of the kind of something most of us had never been through. But now that we've been through and we know the little bit that we know about the potential for pandemic and worldwide pandemic as well as potentially regional pandemic, it's -- to me it's its own independent scenario that is not in the realm of the impossible and has different elements to it than some of the other'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': 'ones that were included in the presentation. So that's my comment.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'That is a very provocative thought to leave us on, Commissioner Argo, and just thinking about how do we consider this and what the options are? And this is such a thoughtful group. I'm excited that we're working with the Council of Governments on this scenario planning. I think all of us are trying to figure it out as we go. I particularly appreciated Commissioner McMahon's comments about working with the human capital leaders in these agencies and what they're hearing from their employees and what they want and how they make their decisions. So it was really such a thoughtful presentation and clearly the federal workforce plays such an important role in our region's economy and the federal workplaces shape development in transportation patterns. So this is an incredibly timely briefing and look forward to additional information as Washington and so many other regions recover and respond to post-pandemic,'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'but as Commissioner Argo reminds us, it could easily happen again and we just have to keep that in our thoughts, to be flexible. So with that are there any other further comments or questions about this agenda item? (No audible response.) at 1:00 p.m. And if 6 there's no other business, this session is now 7 adjourned. 8'"
