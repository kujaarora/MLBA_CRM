        "'MR. FLIS': 'Thank you. Good afternoon, commissioners. Hopefully, you can see my screen. The Federal Railroad Administration has submitted revised concept plans for the Washington Union Station expansion project, which you last reviewed back in 2020. The project components include Amtrak as well as the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation or USRC. So this is a concept review. The Commission as providing comments on the general project approach, including reviewing the project for consistency with the comprehensive plan and identifying planning issues to be addressed prior to the next review. As a reminder, this review is focused on the project which is located on federal land for which NCPC has approval authority. You will also hear, both through my presentation, as well as later testimony about the private air rights development, which is located nearby. This is a project that's subject to local zoning and a separate District review process. So just as'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'a reminder, here you can see Washington Union Station. I think everybody is familiar with the location north of the U.S. Capitol, highlighted here in yellow. Washington Union Station is the second busiest station in the Amtrak network. It includes high-speed Acela service as well as the northeast regional service. The VRE and MARC also serve the station, as well as local and regional bus. So USRC oversees the station operations. This includes maintaining the station as a multi-modal transportation center as well as enhancing the retail and amenities within the station. You will recall that this is a very complex site. It includes the historic station here as well as an existing bus facility and parking garage you can see here. These are located on federal land, which is highlighted in yellow and maintained by USRC. There are other important owners in the area, including Amtrak, which controls the'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'tracks; WMATA, which controls the Metrorail station; the Park Service; as well as Akridge, which is a private air rights owner, which controls these areas that are hatched above the tracks. So moving to the expansion project itself, before pre-pandemic, the station saw about 40 million visitors a year, and the project proponents are still anticipating significant growth through 2040 and, hence, the need for the project. The major components include reconfiguration of the station tracks, a new train hall, bus facilities and parking facilities. Other components include new concourses as well as support spaces, pedestrian and bicycle improvements as well as new pick-up and drop-off areas, or \"PUDO\" for vehicles. You'll recall back in 2020 that the biggest components of this project are the parking, the bus facility and the train hall. So just going back to 2020, this was the original preferred alternative. This included a new east-west'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'train hall highlighted here in blue, the historic station is retained here at the front, as well as a new bus facility here in purple and parking above, which is kind of in a tan color. This facility, again, was above the tracks located in relatively close proximity to the current facility today. So this is from back in 2020. So when you reviewed the project at concept review back then and later during the EIS process, you expressed a number of concerns and provided comments in a few key areas. Overall, you did express support for the transportation improvements but asked that the parking be reduced substantially. You also found that the overall urban design approach, particularly the layout, did not seem to provide a quality experience for users, and then you also found that additional coordination was necessary, particularly with the District agencies as well as the private'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'air rights owner to address some of these issues. So given all these comments as well as those that were received through the EIS process, the FRA has been working closely with a number of stakeholders, including the district and Akridge to revise the project layout. So this is moving on to the revised concept. As I mentioned, back in May with the informational briefing, there are basically a few big changes that have occurred since your last review. These include changes to the parking location, a reduction in the parking program and a reconfigured bus facility and pick-up and drop-off area as well. The new east-west train hall is essentially retained in the same location, which you saw before, and this is right behind the historic station. However, the other moves, including moving the parking and the bus facility, essentially free up the deck level behind the station for'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'some future air rights development, which we'll talk a little bit about later. So talking about the project, I think it's probably most helpful to use this image to start. This is a section through the train hall and some of the other components like the bus facility, looking towards the west essentially. I'm going to start at the lowest level and then work my way up through the projects. And so much of this is happening sectionally. It's really important to see that. So first, in terms of the big changes, the parking has been moved underground. Here you can see that. That's a level below the concourse level, so again, it's moving it from that structure above the tracks down below the station. Secondly, the parking program, which includes pick-up and drop-off as well as rental spaces, has been reduced substantially, almost 50 percent from 1600 spaces to'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'around 860 spaces. This is down from over 2,000 spaces in the station today. So the location of that parking area below the tracks and concourses as well as the pick-up and drop-off area does require some ramps to get access to it. The proposed design has identified a few locations, including the east ramp, the 1st Street entrance, and then a potential ramp on G Street. The design of these ramps is going to continue through the design process. The vehicular circulation will also be analyzed as part of updated environmental review. I do want to point out that the ramp on G Street will require particular attention. It's located in the middle of the right-of-way, and we request further details about the design of this element and also its operation and also request that they, the applicant, coordinate with the adjacent landholders, particularly the Smithsonian Institution, which controls'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'the property at the south, as this element is further designed moving forward. So moving up to the next level, this is above the parking. This is the concourse level. This is similar to what you saw in 2020. A new H Street concourse is going to be provided here, linking east to west. This is essentially under the Hopscotch Bridge area. This will bring passengers closer to the trains at this end of the station so no longer just from the historic train hall. There will also be new concourses connecting from north to south. This layout also includes access and incorporates the new WMATA 1st Street entrance, which is a project you reviewed several years ago. WMATA has said that they will be moving forward with that entrance improvement and that they will need to continue to coordinate that project with the station project moving into the future.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'So just here is a rendering of the new concourses. Again, these are happening below the track level. You can see this rendering of the train tracks, which are located just above. Again, this provides opportunities for connectivity but again, it brings the passengers closer to the trains in a few locations for that easier access. Here is a rendering of the, just the 1st Street entrance to the H Street concourse. Again, this is providing an additional entry point, both from the NoMa neighborhood side as well as Capitol Hill, and I believe in your information you've received testimony and comment from both of those neighborhoods regarding their support for the project. So above the concourse level is the track level. These are needed modernized tracks as well as platforms to meet both accessibility and future growth needs. These have not substantially changed since what you saw back in'",
        "'MR. FLIS': '2020. And then moving up again, this is another area of a substantial change. This is the new bus facility, which has been, again, relocated from the kind of parking garage area to a new east-west alignment that better integrates with the train hall. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 This single level is located at the deck level and provides access from H Street with about 38 or 39 potential bus slips. This would accommodate both inner city as well as tour and charter bus activity. Local buses, including WMATA buses, would likely still be circulating at the street level just to provide that better passenger service. Again, the access for this facility is provided from H Street, which allows for full movement for bus service. Here you can just see a plan'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'view of the new bus facility. Again, it's adjacent to the train hall. We'll note that there is, because of this new proximity, there's a better direct intermodal connection between the bus facility, the train hall and the concourses below. And, therefore, we do find the proposed location of this new bus facility provides a more direct connection to the train hall, the station platforms as well as the new pick-up and drop-off facility, which is above it, and I'll talk about it in a second. We do find that the placement of this facility at the top level also emphasizes the equitable standing of this mode of transportation and also provides an opportunity for day lighting to help really improve that user experience. So here's just a rendering of the new bus facility. Modernization of the facility will certainly be a benefit, but it will require continued coordination and'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'so as the project is further developed, the details are developed, we do recommend the applicant continue to work with the bus operators and other related stakeholders regarding the new bus facility operations as well as opportunities for future vehicle charging stations, thinking about future electrification. And so here's a rendering of the new train hall. Again, this is going to provide both a gathering space but also a connector between the modes of transportation, so in this view, you can actually see the station, the tracks and the trains at this level, the bus facility here and then I'll talk about the top here, the new pick-up and drop-off area. So again, moving up to the top level, this is where there is incorporated a new pick-up and new drop-off area. This would be, again, access from H Street. This is in addition to pick-up and drop-off both at'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'the front of the historic station as well as in the parking level that I talked about earlier. The intention with this, again, is to help distribute that access to several locations around the station, and so it brings the passengers closer to different modes, so at this level you're closest to the bus facility, and it gives you, again, more opportunities for access. So here is just a view of the deck level with the pick-up and drop-off facility and from here, you would be able to circulate down to the buses as well as the trains and concourses, which are below you. So at this level, there is also a proposed new central open space. This would lengthen the pick-up/drop-off area with H Street. It includes new skylights, which would help daylight the concourses below as well as a new headhouse to provide some vertical circulation down to'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'the concourses and tracks. The remainder of this that you see are just essentially illustrative footprints that show how potential air rights could be developed in the future. So as I mentioned, with the relocation of the parking and the reconfiguration of the bus facility, it essentially frees up this area for future air rights development. I'll note that portions of this area, particularly this side, are controlled by the private air rights developer and as such, additional coordination will be necessary between the project proponents and Akridge as these kind of elements are further developed. So here's just a rendering. This is looking from H Street to the south towards the station here in the distance. This new central open space appears to be an improvement from the previous concept. It does provide both that visual and physical length between H Street and the station. And we recognize that'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'the details of this space still need to be developed, but it will be important to understand how this component will be implemented or phased, if by the air rights developer, by UC or USRC or a combination of others and how the public access will be managed. And so we do request that the applicant provide, as part of the next submission, additional details about the operation, maintenance of this open space as well as how this space will be phased in relationship to the rest of the expansion project. In addition to freeing up the deck level as I mentioned earlier for this better urban design approach, relocation of the bus facility also establishes a more, a larger effective setback from the historic station to the future air rights development. This setback has been increased about 35, 40 to 45 feet, which we do find could help provide'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'that additional visual separation between the historic station. We do find that the increased setback may help minimize the impacts to the views of the historic station, which you'll recall was one of our considerations back in 2020, particularly as you look from Columbus Circle, the open space in front of the station and some of the radiating main streets that look towards the station. The applicant has said that they will be preparing additional viewshed analysis as part of the Section 106 process to help better understand these changes. And then, finally, another new project component is the creation of a west ramp, here you can see in the distance. This would connect from the front of the station up to the H Street level. It would be used primarily for bicycles, bicyclists and pedestrians, but could also be used for vehicles at some times. In general, we support'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'the use of the ramp for pedestrian and bicycle use, but for the next submission, it would be helpful to better understand the actual design of this element, particularly to understand the circulation of pedestrians and bicyclists as well as to understand the conditions during which the ramp could function for vehicular use. So just as I wrap up here, staff does appreciate the revised concept's responsiveness to the previous comments. As the project design advances, it may be helpful to remember that the really, the essential importance of the historic station building itself, including the train hall, is the focal point of the entire facility and to continue to retain its role as the primary entrance and the activity and vibrancy of its public spaces should be, should continue to be enhanced. As such, we advise that through both architecture and programming, the historic station should retain its role'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'as the symbolic and functional center of the larger multimodal facility as well as a gateway to the nation's capital. Related to this, staff finds that the proposed expansion project architecture should not try to emulate the historic train station and, therefore, we do support a contemporary architectural design approach for the expansion project that is distinct but compatible with the historic station. So since 2020, the project proponents have worked together with a number of stakeholders, including the private air rights developer to address NCPC comments as well as other comments received through the environmental and historic preservation review process. Overall, we find that the revised design is very responsive to those comments and concerns, and we recommend the Commission express support for the revised concept, particularly the parking program reduction and relocation as well as the reconfiguration of the bus facility along with the other improvements to access'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'an urban design. While the project will continue to be developed and refined as the process advances, we also want to recommend commending the applicant for developing this new plan that substantially responds to previous comments, particularly those regarding parking, urban design, and coordination. I will just end by saying that this is a large complex project. It will return for additional reviews before the Commission, and we do request that the applicant continue to work with the District agencies, other federal partners, as well as the stakeholders, some of which -- some of whom you will hear from today. And so with that, I've already gone through the rest of the recommendations. I'm going to now turn it over to David Valenstein with FRA who will provide some brief remarks as well as introduce representatives from USRC and Amtrak. That will be followed by a short animation of the'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'expansion project. Immediately after that, representatives from Akridge will provide remarks about the Burnham Place projects, also followed by a short animation, and they will conclude with a few slides just talking about their project and the planning work, how their planning and design work intersects with the expansion project. And then, of course, after that, we will move into additional public testimony. So with that, I will now turn it over to Dave Valenstein with FRA.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'Thank you, Matthew, and good afternoon, members of the Commission. My name's David Valenstein, and I'm a Senior Advisor with the Federal Railroad Administration. I've led FRA's engagement on this project since the public process began in 2015. We appreciate the opportunity to provide some remarks and context from the applicants and project proponents' perspective. Commission comments from 2020 and those we received on the draft EIS statement have informed steps to refine project design and develop their revised alternative. Many of the comments requested further consideration of the scale and placement of the parking garage, the volume and location of the pick-up and drop-off functions in coordination with the station expansion project with adjacent private air rights development. It was clear at that time that project changes were necessary. The revised alternative being presented today is a reflection of this, of stakeholder feedback, including the Commission's feedback in coordination'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'with the project teams that I will detail in a moment. Turning to the process of discovery for this revised alternative, it reflects extensive collaboration and engagement with stakeholders and among the project team members. In embarking on collaboration, FRA was guided by two primary design refinement objectives, definable low-grade solution with good ramp access to accommodate vehicle functions. And second, to achieve a one level bus facility of sufficient size and good ramp access that is well integrated with the station. Additionally, a foundational objective of the station expansion project is the preservation of the end use of the historic building. It will remain the primary hub for passenger amenities and front door to the station. Another foundational objective is to integrate the station expansion project with adjacent neighborhoods, businesses and planned plan uses. During 2020, FRA brought the proponents together with the private air rights developer to find'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'a solution that meets objectives, both the station expansion project and the air rights development above it. The balance achieved is a testament to the effective coordination among the project teams for separate projects. While well-coordinated, the station expansion and air rights development remain two projects, funded separately and each subject to their own regulatory framework and approvals. The revised alternative reflects the many months that FRA and the proponents have spent engaging stakeholders, including bus representatives and District Department of Transportation and other members of the District government. The essential needs and requirements of stakeholders have been met. FRA will shortly resume NEPA and the Section 106 processes that were paused in 2020. FRA will prepare and post an additional public hearing on a supplemental draft EIS in the first half of 2023. The environmental review process will provide the public and agencies with further comment opportunities under the'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'revised alternative. I am confident that the revised alternative provides the station expansion project with a solid footing on which to build a successful future for this critical transportation facility. I thank the Commission members for your engagement today, and proponents would now speak about their steps that they took to advance the revised alternative and how it advances their organizations' missions and goals. I will first introduce Kevin Forma from USRC who will speak for that organization.'",
        "'MR. FORMA': 'All right. Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Kevin Forma. I am the 2nd Century Program Manager for Union Station Redevelopment Corporation, USCR. As many of you are aware, USRC manages and operates Washington Union Station on behalf of the federal government. I would first like to thank all the commissioners and the staff for the opportunity to speak to you today regarding the Washington Union Station expansion project. USRC, as one of the proponents along with Amtrak, worked with FRA to develop the potential revised alternative you saw today, to address the public comments that were received following the release of the draft environmental impact statement during 2020 and through our close collaboration with stakeholders, including a private developer, Akridge, the inner city bus carriers, the Guild of Professional Tour Guides and the District, we were able to re-imagine the project by moving beyond the constraints of the'",

This also allowed the station expansion project to provide increased focus on the quality of the original design while still recognizing and respecting the relationship with the adjacent air rights development. The public transportation project, our primary focus was on expansion that manages the anticipated growth and improves the passenger and visitor experience for all travelers regardless of what mode they make depart from or arrive to Washington, DC. Over the past two years and through numerous meetings, USRC and the station expansion team have worked extensively with all stakeholders to create a design and program that we believe is a great foundation for the future of the station. To further advance and refine the new alternative, USRC drew from its unique relationship with the bus drivers and with an effort'",
        "'MR. FORMA': 'to refine the bus facility. The process included many meetings and additional analysis to involve and improve the program we shared here today. The program, we believe, is based on the best currently available information and is designed to meet the future needs of the station. Moving forward, you will USRC and the project team will continue to engage the carriers throughout the remaining planning, design and implementation of the project to further refine the plans for the facility and ensure the bus depot will continue to meet the needs of the carriers. The new train concourse will provide the necessary space to expand the capacity of the stations, while being thoughtful and mindful of the historic significance of the existing station. The new bus facility, to paraphrase the comments we received from the Commission of Fine Arts, is highly responsive by including the bus station in the development as'",
        "'MR. FORMA': 'a bright and dignified convenience for travelers. The new rail facility will provide the additional capacity necessary for the future growth of the Amtrak, MARC, and VRE, and the new passenger concourses will provide new amenities for travelers and visitors while enhancing connections to Metrorail, streetcar, local buses at H Street. The project will also reestablish connections with the surrounding neighborhoods of NoMa and Capitol Hill via the H Street concourse. All of these important upgrades are being accomplished while maintaining the primacy and historic significance of the existing station building. Where its venture provides new access points to the station, USRC is keenly focused on keeping the historic station as an active and vibrant part of the overall multimodal complex. Given the significant increase in expanded and development activity, we anticipate the historic station will remain active as it is facilitating over 50 percent of the future passenger demand.'",
        "'MR. FORMA': 'This happens greater than the total volumes we see today. We anticipate the historic station will be continued to be enjoyed by the traveling public and visitors alike for generations to come. This project will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to significantly upgrade the station's capacity for that century, and to provide equitable access to the station for all members of the traveling public. USRC looks forward to continuing to work with the partners to advance and refine this alternative as the process continues. Thank you for your time, and I believe I am turning this back over to David to introduce our next proponent.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' Thank you, Kevin. I would now like to introduce Dan Sporik who is speaking on behalf of Amtrak, also a project proponent.'",
        "'MR. SPORIK': 'Thank you, David, and good afternoon, commissioners. My name is Dan Sporik, and I'm the Director of Portfolio Management for Amtrak's capital investments at Washington Union Station. As Amtrak is a product proponent, I appreciate the opportunity to provide some commentary on the Washington Union Station expansion project. As previously mentioned, Washington Union Station is the second busiest station in Amtrak's national network, and it is the nexus of multiple lines of rail service, all of which have considerable growth plan in the coming years. The station expansion project will contribute significantly to the transformation of Amtrak and inner-city rail in America. It is consistent with Amtrak's goals of modernizing its assets and working together with our state and local partners as well as FRA, the United States Department of Transportation, to expand our route network. The station expansion project will result in the full reconstruction of tracks and platforms.'",
        "'MR. SPORIK': 'This will not only create a more efficient and effective rail terminal, but it will also provide for the tremendous growth that is planned along the northeast corridor and national network. Of the overall number of tracks and platforms, the overall number of tracks will be reduced. The project will allow for more than double the number of rail passengers and trains that we experience today for both Amtrak and our commuter rail partners. By both lengthening and widening the platforms, operational efficiencies can be captured to accommodate more trains and quicker train times. Additionally, the project will provide new concourses and passenger access for easier connections, more circulation space and an overall enhanced passenger experience. Finally, the multimodal nature of the improvements will provide increased connectivity to other modes, such as Metrorail, streetcar, rideshare, bike and buses. Amtrak is encouraged and supportive of the work that has been undertaken'",
        "'MR. SPORIK': 'by the full team over the last year-and-a-half to refine the station expansion project and believes the product is poised for success going forward. And I look forward to working with all parties to moving the station expansion project forward. Thank you for your time today, and I'll turn it back over to Dave.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' Thank you, Dan. It's my pleasure now to introduce our last speaker with the lead design architect, Niko Dando-Haenisch.'",
        "'MR. HAENISCH': 'Good afternoon, commissioners. My name is Niko Dando-Haenisch. I'm a principal with Grimshaw. They are the design architects working in close collaboration with Beyer Blinder Belle, EHP, and our joint design team to prepare this new concept for the station expansion project. It gives us great pleasure to work on this new concept, and we're pleased today to be able to share some additional information. We'd like to thank the Commission for allowing us to share this additional information as part of this presentation that will be a relatively short animation, which is composed of two parts. The first part goes through the basic elements of the projects and explains a bit more how they all come together, and the second part of the animation provides some initial sense of how all the different spaces will come together to form an expanded Union Station for the future. And with that,'",
        "'MR. HAENISCH': 'I believe we will play the animation from the NCPC computers and will let that roll from this point. Thank you. (Video presentation played.)'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' With that, I'd like to thank the commissioners again for taking the time to allow us to share this information, and I believe that concludes the presentation by the station expansion team and projects, and we will now move on to the separate presentation for the air rights. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Flis, Mr. Valenstein, Mr. Forma, Mr. Sporik, and Mr. Dando-Haenisch. Very impressive video. That was really helpful to see and experience. So at this point, do the commissioners have any questions before we move on? Hearing none, we have seven people signed up to speak. Our first speaker will be David Tuchmann from Akridge. NCPC will separately review Akridge air rights development project as well as this project. The two projects, while distinct, are physically and programmatically linked so our intent is to make sure we hear from all parties throughout the review proceedings to ensure a fully coordinated outcome. As such, the first speaker will have more time allotted. Mr. Tuchmann, I understand you have some remarks followed by a short video and presentation from Mark Gilliand of Shalom Baranes. So Mr. Tuchmann, we're here to hear from you.'",
        "'MR. TUCHMANN': 'Great. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Good afternoon. My name is David Tuchmann, and I'm a Senior Vice President at Akridge, a real estate development firm headquartered here in Washington since 1974. Today I would like to express Akridge's strong support for the FRA's revised concept submission. In the past, we sharply criticized the previous proposal as fundamentally flawed. In contrast, we believe the new planning framework includes station components, open spaces and circulation elements in optimal sizes and locations. The new concept achieves its principal transportation and policy goals while facilitating high quality urban design and opportunities for air rights development. While the station expansion and Burnham Place have different approval processes, the two projects will be planned and constructed concurrently. The station master plan will determine the framework for development opportunity, open spaces and circulation routes for Burnham Place. To assist the Commission and the public in'",
        "'MR. TUCHMANN': 'understanding the urban design and developmental implications of the revised SEP concept, Akridge created materials to show what is conceptually possible for Burnham Place within this framework. While the specific building massing uses and architectural styles depicted in the imagery are not formal proposals, the building sites, roadways and open spaces shown do reflect the parameters set by the SEP. This Commission has previously recognized the need for the FRA and Akridge to coordinate carefully, to align visions for our respective projects. I'm pleased to report that from Akridge's perspective, that mission has been accomplished. During the past 18 months, our teams coordinated intensively and productively. After working personally on these projects for 15 years, I believe their level of planning, design and engineering complexity are unmatched by any project in our region. In three dimensions, the size and location of each program element must be finely calibrated to its'",
        "'MR. TUCHMANN': 'maximum level of efficiency. We set out to develop complementary visions, which address stakeholder feedback and concerns and adhere to these technical constraints. The revised SEP concept and new Burnham Place planning vision you will see momentarily are the products of this collaboration. We believe the three major new additions to parking, PUDO and the bus facility effectively respond to our previous concerns. The revisions open the station's perimeter for pedestrian- and bicycle-oriented activation. The bus facility size and its location, nearly half of which is on Akridge property, unify intercity travel services and a train hall of grand proportion. The bus station's position in section is inventive, making it prominent while minimizing the visual and acoustic impacts of buses at grade level. The removal of the deck level garage and reconfiguration of public and private property lines facilitate a public, two-block long central space, the opportunity for high quality'",
        "'MR. TUCHMANN': 'adjacent development and buildings in the open spaces with appropriate relationships to the historic station building. Burnham Place will comprise a dozen buildings flanking both sides of H Street, parks, plazas, and new circulation routes connecting to the station and adjoining neighborhoods. While projects like the Wharf and the Yards center their focus on the waterfront, Burnham Place will define its identity in relation to Union Station and the neighborhoods that surrounded it. Akridge believes that the SEP and Burnham Place can and must be symbiotic. Urban design, historic preservation and neighborhood connectivity all must be strategically integrated by the two projects. We think that our planning efforts now underway will yield built forms and spaces between them that are optimized and in harmony. For 16 years, I lived within walking distance of the station. I cannot recall a single time going to Union Station purely to experience the environment'",
        "'MR. TUCHMANN': 'surrounding the building. Our vision in the future is that people will come to this area not just when they have to travel through the station but because they choose to experience a caliber of urban development normally associated with great European and Asian stations, here in our nation's capital. Neighbors, tourists, and travelers will explore a remarkable public building with national significance that is seamlessly connected to unique open spaces with both civic and neighborhood character. We believe we are now well on our way toward achieving this shared vision. Thank you for the opportunity, and I'll now turn things over to our lead designer, Mark Gilliand, Senior Principal at Shalom Baranes Associates.'",
        "'MR. GILLIAND': 'Thank you, David. As was noted earlier, we're going to start our presentation by sharing with you today another animation, one that describes aspects of the revised SEP certainly but focuses in on the Burnham Place project in particular with -- part of this will describe opportunities and possibilities for the public accessible open spaces in and around the air rights buildings and its illustrative vision of what's possible. Please roll the video. (Video presentation played.) I hope that video was useful in orienting everyone. Hopefully, the following presentation, which is brief, will help to answer any questions the video may have raised for you. Please bring up that presentation. So the deck that we put together here includes selected pages from the larger package of Burnham Place presentation materials submitted earlier to NCPC, and it's really intended to give you all a succinct and high-level overview of Burnham Place'",
        "'MR. GILLIAND': 'and importantly to describe its complementary relationship to the revised SEP. Next, please. So the side area is large, covering roughly 20 acres and its location is prominent. It's situated directly behind historic Union Station, and the public and private projects will together reinforce a niche of the federal city, a niche that was envisioned with the McMillan Plan. It's also important to note that the site extends into it. It is embraced by flanking D.C. neighborhoods. Next, please. So again, there are some really amazing precedents for integrative transportation in new development projects. Some are shown here. Among the things that we've gleaned from looking at projects like these from around the world is that with planning framework that is complementary and coordinated between station and neighborhood projects, harmonized and successful projects result. Through integrated planning, the whole should be greater than the sum of its parts. Next, please.'",
        "'MR. GILLIAND': 'Development at this site will serve important federal, city and neighborhood interests. It will complement the gateway to D.C. that is historic Union Station. It will also offer an incredible opportunity, an opportunity to stitch together neighborhoods, neighborhoods that have been long separated by the elevated rail yard. Next, please. The air rights development sitting directly above the SEP requires vertical integration. It's really fundamental to the two projects. At the level labeled here in this axonometric drawing is train hall, deck and bus facility. Horizontal integration is required at that level. So over the past year-and-a-half as we mentioned, the revised SEP and Burnham Place revisions have been carefully coordinated to work towards that integration. Next, please. So this is a diagram of that train hall, deck and bus facility level, sort of a composite, but it describes the SEP program with circulation components that establish the fundamental aspects'",
        "'MR. GILLIAND': '-- certain fundamental aspects -- of air rights planning framework. Those components are shown here, and they include the train hall, the bus facility, the skylight zone over the central concourse, a new station entrance on H Street, and the circulation loop for station pick-up and drop-off for cars and buses. You can see that the bus and station PUDO -- pick-up and drop-off -- functions run from H Street to the bus station and the train hall, respectively. Buses will enter on the east service road up against Station Place and exit to the west. Station PUDO vehicles enter from the west, ramp up and above that bus facility and then back down on the east side to H Street. Next, please. Air right circulation can build on that perimeter's regulation that is established by the SEP utilizing that same loop south of H Street and extending it to'",
        "'MR. GILLIAND': 'the north side of H Street. Along with that loop, the introduction of central roadways through the center spaces provide important access to the front doors to air rights buildings. The loop and the central roadways together create a functional circulation that work for the projects. Next, please. So this next diagram demonstrates that we're not just thinking about cars. In addition to providing for vehicular access and circulation, the SEP framework enables critically important pedestrian and bicycle access up to and at the air rights deck level. For example, as a result of the SEP modifications around that west edge, the west ramp, which of course runs parallel to 1st Street, pedestrian and bicycle access is enabled between Columbus Circle up to H Street, providing an important connection, particularly for bikes, up to Burnham Place within air rights development. Next, please. The SEP framework also provides for open spaces'",
        "'MR. GILLIAND': 'south of H Street. Those spaces can be linked to additional spaces north of H Street, creating a connected, rich and diverse open space network, an open space network that is embraced and framed by air rights development sites. Next, please. In this illustrative site plan for a mixed use air rights development, you can see how air rights building preference delineate the edges of that open space network. A mixed use, transit oriented development is envisioned, a combination of office, residential and hotel uses that would typically set at top, activated ground floor uses across the site. And as you saw in the animation, there is an aspiration to include a cultural and institutional use to enhance the viability and vibrancy of the planned neighborhood. Next, please. So this is the final image in the presentation of the illustrative rendering that was developed to describe what an air rights'",
        "'MR. GILLIAND': 'development that is thoughtfully coordinated with the revised SEP can provide. It's obviously an aerial view looking south towards the Capitol grounds and the mall, and it describes a connection between and extensions to existing flanking neighborhoods. The tear in L'Enfant's urban fabric that was created with the rail yard when it was established, that tear was created when it was established, can be mended and long-separated neighborhoods on both sides of the tracks can be bridged and reconnected by both the public and the private projects. So this is the final image of our presentation. Thank you very much for the opportunity.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you very much, Mr. Gilliand and Mr. Tuchmann. Does the Commission have any questions for our presenters? Hearing none, our next speaker is Gregory Cohen with Greyhound Bus Lines. Mr. Cohen, welcome. You have three minutes to speak.'",
        "'MR. COHEN': 'Thank you very much, Madame Chair and Members of the Commission. I'm Greg Cohen representing Greyhound Lines. Greyhound provides the backbone of intercity bus transportation in America serving more than 2,000 communities. Intercity bus is the greenest mode and the mode of choice for cost conscious travelers seeking the most affordable transportation. The Union Station Redevelopment Act created a new vision which was once a train station as to become a complex primarily as a multiple-use transportation terminal and secondarily as a commercial complex. The law specifically recognizes the importance of intercity buses in the redeveloped complex. We worked for decades to relocate Greyhounds into Union Station and succeeded in 2012. And say, without the support of Congresswoman Norton, we might still be three blocks away with our passengers rolling their luggage over the sidewalks to get there. Today we support implementation of a world-class redevelopment that provides a walk'",
        "'MR. COHEN': 'main gateway for all. Washington is the southern terminus of the most well-traveled bus corridor in America. At the northern terminus Boston is building a major expansion of its intercity bus facility at South Station while New York is planning to do the same at the new Port Authority terminal. The goal in these cities is to get away from inadequate facilities that push intercity bus pickups into the neighborhoods and onto local city streets. However, in Washington, all of the working alternatives call for bus slip capacity to be substantially reduced from our current 61 to 69 spaces while rail capacity and commercial development are dramatically increased. This suggests the transportation needs of bus customers are of secondary importance. I'm here to ask the NCPC to make sure that the intercity bus mode is treated equitably and with dignity by increasing capacity for intercity buses. The DEIS recognizes that'",
        "'MR. COHEN': 'minorities and low-income persons rely on the bus for intercity travel much more than other demographics. That is certainly the case with Greyhound which is a majority/minority provider. Greyhound has worked with the planners and stakeholders to increase bus capacity. This included engaging with one of the most, world's most experienced intercity bus facility architects to show how with minor modifications, the architect's work, the bus slip capacity could be increased from 34 to 56 slips. We have made some progress in that the latest design from the architects include 39 bus slips on the bus deck and room for 12 staging spots on the PUDO level above with direct access to the loading and unloading areas on the bus deck. While Greyhound strongly prefers growth in capacity rather than reduction, we are open to a compromise based on the FRA's plans, but only under some key conditions. First we'",
        "'MR. COHEN': 'do request that the 56-slip plan that we proposed and the other bus deck carriers agreed to receive more detailed analysis and more thoughtful consideration. Second, if that plan is ultimately rejected, we request --'",
        "'MR. JUTTON': ' That's three minutes.'",
        "'MR. COHEN': ' Well, sir, we're an organization. We understood that originally that organizations had five minutes.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Please continue, Mr. Cohen.'",
        "'MR. COHEN': ' Okay. If the 56 plan is ultimately rejected, we request that the latest 39 plus 12 plan that FRA is working on includes a written commitment that the 12 staging area spots be guaranteed to be available to intercity buses on demand. Three, the plan should recognize and commit to keeping access costs at current levels plus inflation. And fourth, the scheduled service open to the public have priority access to the bus deck. Again, we have developed a positive working relationship with the planners, but we do not yet support the latest plans. If we can reach an agreement that meets the conditions like discussed that would help to keep the project moving quickly. I also want to take a moment to thank the Fine Arts Commission participants at the latest Norton hearing for recognizing the importance of bus access. Thank you, again, for the opportunity to testify.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Do Commissioners have any questions for Mr. Cohen? Hearing none, we will move to our next speaker, Mr. Dan Rodriguez with Coach USA. Mr. Rodriguez, welcome and you have three minutes to provide your testimony.'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'Thank you. I am before you as a representative of both Coach USA and subsidiary Megabus and Bus Association of New Jersey of which I am President of. By way of background, Coach USA is one of the largest transportation operators in North America. We operate more than 2,500 buses and coaches and employ hundreds, thousands of across the nation and Canada. We bring service to financially insecure diverse families who depend on our services for fast and affordable transportation to their jobs and other important destinations. Megabus has served more than 55 million customers throughout more than a hundred cities and most importantly, our passengers who rely on economical and efficient transportation to the D.C. area. We have carefully reviewed the draft environmental impact study and find it's disconnected between the alternatives provided and the motor coach traveler needs. To displace and significantly reduce the bus capacity of Megabus'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'would rupture the very specific intent of what the Union Station set out to achieve in the Union Station Redevelopment Act of 1981. Specifically, it empowers the Secretary of Transportation to and I quote, \"provide the rehabilitation and redevelopment of the Union Station complex primarily as a multiple use transportation terminal service for the nation's capital and secondarily, as a commercial complex\" end of quote. While the Union Station Redevelopment Act was enacted in 1981, a bus deck was not offered to the public at Union Station until 2012. The popularity was instantaneous as it increased over the years and now provides Megabus and other carriers 61 bus slips to use on a regular basis for the loading and unloading of passengers. These bus slips offer a safe way for customers to avoid traffic and protects them from the elements of weather. And it's no action alternative that the DEIS'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'provides that intercity bus service is projected to increase from 2.5 million passengers annually to 3.17 million passengers annually or an increase of 27 percent. Moreover, the DEIS also notes an increase in the rail service to grow 24 percent. These increases for both rail and bus are necessary to point out for this insofar as they are not only projecting a similar rate increase, but also reflects the need to provide multiple use options for travel. The DEIS provides a variety of the alternatives, but in every instance, there is a reduction to the bus facility area and significant increase to the rail tracks and platforms. Our concern lies with the ability to meet the same increased demand and still continue to have a fully operational and functional home at Union Station that is satisfactorily equipped to achieve this purpose. A reduction of bus slips would create a disparity'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'of choice for those who depend on us the most. This disparity does not serve the USRA --'",

The data is provided and the DEIS shows that there is a clear need for less costly, efficient, and reliable transportation options. Bus transportation provides a myriad of opportunities that will only increase over time. To stifle and protract those opportunities would be a disservice to the public, especially the underserved. Our preference would be to preserve the current levels of bus slips. The alternatives that are proposed in the DEIS are woefully lacking in meeting our operational needs. The proposed reduction to 40 bus slips capacity is a reduction from the July 7th, 2016, Memorandum which originally provided an allowance of 47 bus slips. Between 2016 and 2019, Megabus increased its trips to Union Station by 22 percent. In May of 2020, that continues to'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'support the 47 slips as is noted in the alternatives. Also the bus slips at a range from 17 to 27 would not be conducive for either bus passenger operating carrier or surrounding area of Union Station as it will dramatically decrease economic activity generated by tourism and business travel. For Thanksgiving of 2019, Megabus added 40 extra buses to ensure we met demand for Union Station as a final destination. Seventeen or 40 bus slips could not handle this event and others in any practical efficient manner. Simply put, the reduction of slips does not address or acknowledge how much reduced bus facility would accommodate the influx of bus travelers. Coach USA considers itself a part of the mosaic of Union Station and it's optimistic and enthusiastic to help bring the project to fruition. But it must be done in preserving and retaining a sufficient number of bus slips'",

I also want to acknowledge the commitment of the District Government to the Union Station expansion project in general. In particularly, not only the Mayor, but the leadership of Council Chairman Phil Mendelson in making the initial launch investment in the H Street bridge which is really on the critical path of the project with platform work that has to be done along with some work now studying various alternatives to get this project underway.

Why do we support this so strongly? We've heard a lot of the reasons already, right size, optimally located parking facilities not only respond to our customer needs as people ingress, egress from Union Station via cars, but balances just for the other uses at the station. We believe that the bus facility not only effectively accommodates, efficiently accommodates bus ridership including the number of slips, but very importantly, as a matter of equity and inclusion, I am very excited about the fact'",
        "'MR. WILLIAMS': 'that the Union Station expansion project really celebrates bus along with rail travel. Bus travel is an important element of a modern city's transportation needs. Whether we came to America in American cities in steerage or bondage, you know cities were about upward mobility, upward mobile access and bus transit is an important part of that. And celebrating that as part of the public spaces and the internal workings of the station I think is really worthy of praise. I talked about the parking, I will mention that again. Integrating a number of modes of transit, I always say, if you take the south lines of Pancras station, I always say if you took Pancras station, Paddington station in London, and Charing Cross and threw them all together, you would have the important intramodal complex transportation network that you'd see at a revised expanded Union Station project. This does it'",

Not only through the air rights that we've seen, but in the station itself really celebrating the monumental character of the original Burnham Station. But really in an important way, and in a compatible way, blending that with the rest of the neighborhood making it not only a place for transportation as we heard, but a place to come and celebrate and really recreate and really enjoy what a modern city like Washington, D.C. can offer by having a Union Station expanded as a key anchor on the northeast quarter. So, Madam Chair and Members of the Commission, thank you for allowing me to testify. Let's go get them with the project. Appreciate it.'",

My organization just reached its 25th anniversary and we advocate for walkable, bikeable and trans-running communities as the most sustainable and equitable way for the Washington, D.C. region to grow and to provide opportunities for all. When we last commented on the plans for Union Station back in January 2020, we affirmed our strong support for extending rail service and the station and the Burnham Place development, but did share significant concerns about the proposal's mention of thousands of above-ground parking spaces which we felt undermined the entire design of the facility. Therefore,'",

However, in our view, if it is indeed 860, it's probably still too many and we've heard that 400 to 700 spaces was possible. And we urge the selection of the lower end of the range. The overwhelming focus of this downtown hub must be on transit, pedestrian and bicycle access as well as pick up and drop off. But the removal of the parking garage in place of the parking underground is transformative. It's allowed for the amazing train concourse or the natural light, included access to the trains, the bus station and a pickup and drop off.

The upper pick up and drop off roadway must allow for safe ped bike access to the public spaces in the Burnham Place development and it should include well-marked crossings, traffic coming and unseen safety monitors as necessary. Bicycle access to this station is important. It's good to see the new additional bike connectivity and it should include, I don't think I saw an illustration of it, a well-located secure, modern and easy to use bike station similar to those in Europe that accommodate thousands of bicycles.

Finally, we commend your attention to the positive letter of support from ANC-6C from people who live in the immediate neighborhood who told me they were unable to attend in person today and who worked closely with the planners to improve the design and circulation and integration with the neighborhood.

The update to the Union Station revised expansion plans to eliminate the existing parking garage and thereby allow, excuse me, thereby allow re-alignment of the tracks and, but there is no discussion about the re-alignment of the tracks and only very limited and dated information about the lower level tracks that provide access to the First Street tunnel and south. That was shown on Sheet 17 of the NCPC presentation. The new rail bridge across the Potomac and the additional southwest tracks that the new rail bridge will provide will allow increased Amtrak service south and increased MARC service. And the new rail bridge in southwest tracks will result in separation of passenger and freight rail operations south of Union Station. This momentous change in rail'",

The run through tracks on the lower level will need to accommodate the increased passenger commuter traffic to and from the south. But Sheet 19 of NCPC file 7746 Modernized Tracks and Platforms, which I believe was Sheet 17 in the NCPC presentation, shows only seven'",
        "'MR. EDWARDS': 'run through tracks. The same number of run through tracks in the June 2020 Union Station DEIS, and does not take into consideration the new two-track Long Bridge railroad crossing, substantial CSX trackage in Virginia that FRA has and will acquire as well as the new fourth track in Southwest that will separate passenger and commuter from rail operations. The 2020 Union Station DEIS failed to take into account this increased number of Amtrak trains to and from the south as well as the MARC through running to Virginia and Virginia through running to Maryland. Appendix B of the Union Station DEIS showed 29 Amtrak trains, eight MARC trains and 46 VRE trains would use the new Long Bridge by 2040. But Page 329 of the Long Bridge DEIS shows 44 Amtrak trains, eight MARC trains and 92 VRE trains and eight Norfolk Southern trains that would use the southwest'",
        "'MR. EDWARDS': 'tracks and Long Bridge by 2040. The updated Union Station expansion analysis needs to account for this increased rail traffic and design of the lower run through tracks. We would like to emphasize in closing that Union Station is a rail station and needs to be a keynote essential of the Union Station expansion. Thank you very much for allowing me to speak.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you Mr. Edwards. Do Commissioners have any questions for Mr. Edwards? Commissioner Mendelson?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' Well my question is related to Mr. Edwards' testimony as well as the two bus companies. Does FRA have, I would like to hear the response, I don't know if they have their transportation expert or engineer present to answer.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' So you'd like FRA to respond to the concerns raised by the bus operators as well as the concerns from Mr. Edwards about track and operations?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' Yes.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' I think this would be a great time to do that and we do have one more speaker.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' Oh, I'm sorry.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Mr., oh no, that's okay. Shall we go ahead since Mr. Valenstein is ready here and if there comes, if something comes up in the next one, we will ask you to come back. But thank you, Mr. Valenstein, for addressing these issues.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' Thank you, Madam Chair. And I will call on some of the other SEPs, the SEP sponsors to also and help answer these questions. In terms of the bus operations, we have to keep in mind the existing condition of 61 bus slips as not, they're not 61 active used bus slips, but 61 spaces for buses in the existing facility. Whereas the new facility, the number count is all for very active use, ped, I mean passenger access slips that are meant, designed to modern standards. The, in terms of capacity, there are many studies that we've completed about capacity and forecasting and they will be well documented in the supplemental draft DEIS and so in terms of additional response on the bus, I would ask Kevin Forma if he would join.'",
        "'MR. FORMA': 'Yes, so I think just looking on or connecting to what David said, you know, we do have 61 slips today, however, there are only a portion of those are actively used for intercity carriers. There are a lot of ancillary uses on the bus deck for circulator or some trebles, other allotted vehicle parking that were not accounted for moving forward or I should say they were not counted in the structure facility moving forward. You know, regarding the circulator, we've pledged to work with the District on something that makes sense campus wide approach to that. The analysis that we did with taking the carriers' comments in mind allowing for ample room to put the carriers to lay over in the facility and really looking at the existing schedules and applying them appropriate growth methodology to 2040. So I hope that answers your question on the carriers and'",
        "'MR. FORMA': 'the amount of spaces that we have. We, of course, continue and will continue to work with carriers and all stakeholders moving forward on further refining the alternative as it advances. Also definitely as the Commission recommended or the Staff recommended, working on an operations plan that works for both the intercity carriers and for the two unchartered tour groups that we can see there at the station.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' I can follow up on the buses. Right now are the slips actively managed or is it more passive and going forward is it possible to get greater efficiency by having I'm going to say by having active management of the utilization?'",
        "'MR. FORMA': ' The future concept is definitely a change in operations and that is why we will plan on moving, working with the carriers to refine that operation as future technology develops and that to direct response to your question today, no, we do not have an active management approach as such.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' Today?'",
        "'MR. FORMA': ' Today, yes. I mean that, you know, the existing station does get overwhelmed at times with tour and charter activity especially if there's protests or some event on the National Mall so we do get up to capacity during those events. I believe, you know, the plan moving forward would be what was mentioned is the PUDO facility on top, on top of the bus station as sort of a relief and safety valve when it's needed to allow for additional bus activity. So those were the 12 spaces that I believe a great, they come from Greyhound mentioned so again, we are actively working on refining the operational program moving forward. But, you know, we'll need to continue to develop that as the technology arises and we see what best practices are as we get closer to building the facility.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' What about the testimony, Mr. Valenstein, regarding the, what is it called, the run through rail?'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'Certainly. Thank you for the question. There's actually the two projects, the Long Bridge project and the Union Station project, have been well coordinated as FRA has been the lead federal agency in planning both projects. Specifically, what I, you know, while there may be some specific documentation alignment issues from the 2020 draft DEIS for Union Station and documentation around the Long Bridge project, there may be some confusion around that. We see the capacity and a forecast as harmonized and aligned. The Union Station project has been carefully planned to provide the necessary capacity anticipated in the south corridor going to Virginia. The increase is in the area service increases in Amtrak service and in the potential for MARC and VRE through running trains that, you know, it's a VRE train to the south and it's a MARC train to the north, but it's the same train and'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'it continues in both directions. It, my colleague Dan Sporik, is there anything, would you like to join? Is there anything else you'd like to add on that topic?'",
        "'MR. SPORIK': 'Yes, certainly, David. Sorry, am I coming through now? Yes, I think in terms of overall capacity, in the future as before, I mentioned we're actually producing the number of tracks, however, tracks, platforms will be wider and longer. So we're increasing the linear feet of platform length available for revenue service. So this does a lot for us operationally. We're able to operate more efficiently, we're able to double stack trains, and particularly in the lower level. While we're not increasing the number of revenue tracks, we're also adding special track work. It doesn't exist today so this allows for movement of trains, switching and entering into the tunnel and heading south. And just to echo with David, you said earlier, you know Amtrak and our state partners are working directly with FRA on both projects as well and we're well aware and aligned on capacity increases south of'",
        "'MR. SPORIK': 'Washington, but then also north as well.'",
        "'MR. EDWARDS': ' I would like to mention that the attachment to my testimony contains extracts from both the Long Bridge EIS which is now a record of decision and the draft EIS for Union Station. Both of them are 2020 dates, however, we have 29 Amtrak trains in the Union Station analysis, 44 Amtrak trains in the Long Bridge analysis. I'm concerned that we know that both now Maryland and Virginia have authorized through running and through running of MARC to Maryland, MARC to Virginia and VRE to Maryland was not taken into account in these figures. And we're concerned that are we adequately allowing capacity for the railroads to do what they're planning and for this Union Station as we rebuild it and expand it to serve as an efficient rail station. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Edwards. Mr. Valenstein, I would ask if you want to take some time with that question perhaps and the next presentation and come back and respond to that. I'm sure it's a very complex answer and something that you're working out throughout the process since we're at conceptual stage. But thank you very much for answering the previous questions. Commissioner Mendelson, did you have further questions you wanted to pose?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' No, I think that it would be helpful if Mr. Valenstein came back with the further comment.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' Very well.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' The last speaker is Laura Moore. Ms. Moore, you have three minutes to speak.'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'Thank you so much. I actually am speaking towards the tour bus issue. I'm a licensed, VCR Licensed D.C. Tour Guide and I live in D.C. also. So I use Union Station for many reasons, but professionally meet tour guides regularly at Union Station. Groups arrive by motor coach from out of state. Often in convoys of several buses that bring hundreds of tourists at a time to Washington. During our busy spring season, there may be thousands and I do mean thousands of tourists, mostly students, eighth graders are our bread and butter, using Union Station at the same time for lunch or dinner so one way to think about this is that tour buses bring in lots of dollars and could under the right conditions bring in lots more. I'm also a board member of the Guild of Professional Tour Guides of Washington, D.C. The professional tour guide,'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'tour association, professional association of about 500 local guides and affiliated tour operators and I'm Co-Chair of the Guild's Government and Tourism Committee which has been liaising for the last few years with USRC on these redevelopment plans. Tour guides are an important stakeholder in the project. Our business will be greatly impacted by these proposals. So I'm really grateful to be able to speak for my three minutes here. We did have profound objections to the 2020 DEIS plans which would have routed tour buses into local neighborhoods, increased congestion and pollution and vast greatly inconvenienced tour groups accessing the station and at worst, put them into actual dangerous situations. So I'm really grateful to USRC and a shoutout especially to Kevin Forma who's great to work with, for taking our comments seriously in this new plan. The Co-Chair, my Co-Chair of this committee and I are pleased to'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'see that there will now be enough space for tour groups to unload and move safely through the station. And that motor coach operators will be able to park their buses safely and for the amount of time necessary for tour groups to shop and eat which is the main reason they come to Union Station. We also really appreciate the analysis of data on usage and the projections on usage in deciding on the number of parking slips for buses. We do, however, share concerns with our friends at the bus carriers in continuing to worry that there will not be enough parking spaces especially during our busy seasons, during mealtimes when we can be really slammed. So I do want to really emphasize as much as possible that need to safely drop off and pick up groups and by group I do mean it could be hundreds of'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'people at the same time. Honestly, those wonderful animations would be realistic in my view of these and the images of dozens of 13-year olds in matching neon t-shirts. So I'd like to suggest perhaps dedicating slips specifically for drop off and pick up, something like that, but our feeling is that at this point our concerns are mostly operational rather than with the design. An example of that is that tour groups usually arrive without reservations and cannot realistically hold to a specific drop off and pick up times. So those are some conversations we're looking forward to continuing to have with USRC as they move on into these next stages of planning. Thanks so much.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Ms. Moore. Did Commissioners have any questions for Ms. Moore? Hearing none, you have our thanks for reminding us about the eighth graders and such a traditional thing for eighth graders to do is to visit the capital. So your concerns about operations I'm sure will be taken to heart and I hope you stay engaged in the communications in the rest of the process. That concludes the public testimony on this proposal. Copies of all of the testimony are also included on our website. In addition, we received comment letters from the NOMA Business Improvement District, ANC-6C, the Washington Area Bicyclist Association and from Council member Charles Allen. I will now open up the item to discussion with the Commission. Could everyone please turn on your cameras. I will start with Commissioner Mendelson and then go in a round robin format using our normal seating order and'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'I ask that you keep your webcams on during the discussion. So Commissioner Mendelson?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' Thank you, Madam Chair. You had suggested that Mr. Valenstein or FRA or Amtrak respond to Mr. Edwards' last comments and I'd like to hear that.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes, I did and I don't know how detailed their answer will be, but I would love to give Mr. Valenstein an opportunity to at least speak to the issue today and, of course, come back with a more examined answer for us. Please, Mr. Valenstein.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity of a couple of minutes to look at some material. The data in the station expansion project documentation is about round trip train trips, and the data in the Long Bridge EIS is about one way, sorry, is about one-way trips. So to compare, am I saying that the wrong way, the Union Station data would need to be doubled to make it the same as the Long Bridge data. I'm sorry, so it's the other way around. Yes, the Union Station data is about one-way trips. And the Long Bridge data is about round trips so they're not apples and oranges. They are apple and oranges. They're not constant apples so the, Mr. Edwards cited 44 Amtrak trips, those are in both directions. The Union Station data showed 29 Amtrak trips. You would need to double that to make it comparable data'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': 'to the Long Bridge document which would be about 30 and, or sorry, it would be about 60 actually. So it's a higher number than the Long Bridge document and that was, we were stress testing the station and so we're not constraining it by what was planned for the Long Bridge project. So it's actually higher, a higher number in terms of capacity. I'm not, I hope I'm making sense. I'm muddling answers. But the, this is the core of the issue is that we represented the number of round trips in the Union Station document. We represented one-way trips in the Long Bridge document so it was a different and the data meant different things.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' I think he also spoke to VRE and MARC.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' Yes, he did. So in, for instance, in the SEP document, Mr. Edwards cited 46 VRE trains and in the Long Bridge document, 92. If you do, if the 46 are round trips and you double them for one-way trips, that would equal 92.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' So in essence, the data is comparable between the two studies.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' More importantly, what you're saying is the FRA has looked carefully at the increased capacity or usage on Long Bridge. And looked at that in connection with Union Station or vice versa.'",
        "'MR. VALENSTEIN': ' That's accurate.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner Mendelson, any other comments or --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MENDELSON': ' Not at the moment. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Ginsberg?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GINSBERG': 'Thanks. I am here. I have a couple of things. One is I just wanted to thank everybody for the tour that we took I guess it was last week. That was really helpful so thank you for bringing us on that tour. Second, I just want to mention that I think a lot of what we're hoping to happen here will be supported by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. So I just want to put that out there saying we're really excited that this legislation that we've enacted in Congress can be so helpful in the communities that matter a lot to everyone every day. Third, I want to state that I was in touch with Ms. Norton and her staff and they just wanted to reiterate through me that they support all the needs for the buses to get in and have visitors get safely on and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GINSBERG': 'off the buses and to make sure that we are planning for continued growth and surge capacity when surge capacity is needed at the facility. And to make sure that we go back and ensure that we can accommodate the needs of everyone who wants to come to the city by whatever means of transportation they choose and whatever means of transportation they can afford. I'm glad to see the data and evidence are being used to help make that planning possible. But it seems like there might need to be a little more thinking on that. Some of the other things that just came to mind, I know that when we took the tour, David Tuchmann, I'm not even sure I'm saying his name right, but we talked a little bit about civic spaces. And I've been thinking about what that means and I looked at a lot of'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GINSBERG': 'the renderings that they have about the civic area designed out back and that looks really good if it's spring or fall, but maybe not when it's summer or winter. And I'm going to put on my Commissioner Cash hat for a second and warn against water fixtures for a brief moment and think that through. But I understand the complexity of trying to figure out what a civic space actually means and I took something that we learned when we were visiting the facility the other day is that there was a community that was interrupted that was divided when Union Station was originally built just after the turn of the century. And I'm thinking maybe this is the moment to rebuild that community and show that community through that civic space and tell the story of what it was called, I guess it was called Swampoodle back in'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GINSBERG': 'the day. And maybe bringing that community back into reality presented more vividly and remember the communities and the people who lived there and how they were disrupted by this space and celebrate that community. Just me thinking out loud about what could be possible with this space. Plus, they had apparently like a really cool baseball club and a baseball stadium which gives you a lot to work with. Let's see if there's anything else. The other thing I was just thinking about like this gives you like a very big opportunity to talk about like the history of locomotives, the history of transportation and the history of amazing architecture and historical design in D.C. There's just so many things you could do with that space that would make it I think a civic destination plus maybe more useful year around than just a bunch of water spaces and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GINSBERG': 'water fixtures that you walk through. And as a final pitch and this is where I put on my Commissioner May hat, and I talk about the use of bikes. I know when we visited the facility, the movement of bikes with pedestrians and with vehicles. It already is not good. It was pretty dangerous and confusing. I'm hoping that the re-design can help that, but I'm also curious to see what is going to be done in terms of where you can leave your bike. It doesn't look like the existing bike rack structure is maintained. I'd love to see what is brought through there and I'd love to learn more about sort of this signage about how you're going to use customer experience to make sure that the traffic flow that you've envisioned by design is actually the traffic flow that you're going to see in reality once'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GINSBERG': 'this is finished and how you're going to make that as intuitive as possible. And I think those were the things that came into my head, but thank you for this opportunity.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you so much for those thoughtful comments. Commissioner Cozart.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'Yes, thank you. I'm happy to follow Commissioner Ginsberg on this because I think some of my comments are aligned there. We're really pleased to see the refinements from the FRA on those concept plans that were summarized there. And also particularly around reducing parking and a second look at the bus facility and a second look at the pick up and drop off areas. I also really appreciated the videos that were shared. That's a significant level of work and I'm really impressed with the racial and age diversities I saw in the videos. I didn't see as much diversity around kind of personal mobility, didn't see a lot of people in wheelchairs or using mobility assisted devices. I think that is actually important to think about in the same way that we think about folks who are traveling as pedestrians like cyclists and vehicles so just wanting to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'encourage continued thought about that. We are really interested as the project moves forward and support it moving forward, really focusing in on again pedestrian and multi-modal connectivity, retaining the historic stature and civic character of the station and the environments is really important both for the station extension itself and the air rights that are related to the surrounding communities. So this is very much tied to the policies and most recently about the comprehensive plan and so I just wanted to flag the issues related to accessible pedestrian connections, making sure that as we move forward there's better, there's greater, certainty around that and making sure that there's linkages to the adjacent neighborhoods from that perspective. And that we look forward to seeing more information about that. Also, those multi-modal connections really honing in on how those are going to play out both from a design perspective, but'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'then also from a feasibility perspective in just making sure that the experience of a traveler is one where it's accessible and streamlined. Also, really thinking about what are those arrivals and departures that happened at the historic grand entrance at Columbus Circle, how is that well aligned? Also, want to think about what are the kind of the ground floor treatments and the activations at the street level and just making sure that as we have ramps and access to parking structures, that we're avoiding those blank facades and making sure that the kind of character around those are ones that folks who are traveling to Union Station will enjoy. And really I appreciate in the presentation the piece that NCPC staff flagged around the D Street ramp. That's a really important component that probably would benefit from a design charrette between both District and federal partners there. Also'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'want to, from a historic preservation standpoint and overall urban design standpoint, really reflect on kind of the south entrance and its distinct and clear character reading as a civic space that's inviting to all, that's one that everyone belongs in. We need to make sure that the best elements of that and are treated for the north entrance too so that reads clearly like a specific space, not like a private space but like one that folks would want to be a part of. So I really, like I said, want to second what, some of the ideas from Commissioner Ginsberg because I think those speak to that more civic kind of space. As it relates to the air rights portion, you know, that piece around kind of the central green, it being, feeling like a civic space designed for all is really important. Really thinking about the buildings'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'that are closest to the new train hall, what is their design character and thinking about making sure that there's good transitions there. That's the kind of thing that will be important for us to think about. But certainly on behalf of Mayor Bowser, we're very supportive of this project moving forward, the approval of the comments from the NCPC is providing to this and very much the next steps around continuing to engage the community are very important. I was happy to see the information come in from Councilmember Allen and the ANC and a number of civic groups commenting on this and looking forward to continuing to move forward with this to fund the station expansion and the air rights development. And so want to see that to, that continue in terms of next steps. So that's, those are my main comments. I don't really have questions. Really'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'appreciate the staff presentation and we know this has been a complicated project or complex project and so appreciate the staff for all of the coordination that they have done and will continue to do as we go forward.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner McMahon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'Yes, thank you. Not a whole lot of questions. I'm just going to listen to the other members of the Commission who have very good comments and recommendations which I've heard and so far I agree with. The only thing I'm watching and just would note is this continuing conversation about capacity both for rail, especially rail south, and also for buses, making sure that's right. We've heard a discussion on both sides about what's needed compared to what they're building. The only other thing I just note in here, we haven't talked about it much is whether we are providing the appropriate connections in the new designs for Metro, having taken that much of station, I think about a month ago to have weekend dinner with guests from out of town. It's not an afterthought. Many of you know more about how that was built at Union Station than'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'I do, but I didn't see much discussion of it in the presentation or in the plan so I think moving forward with, overall, it looks to be a well thought out design that responded to many of your comments as well as others over the last year that that's looked at and given the due, it's, I think that WMATA will need to succeed in the future. Thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yes, thank you. So it will be a challenge, but I'll try to be brief. So the first thing I'll say is that all right, I'll, you know, people are channeling other people in this meeting so I'll channel Daniel Burnham and say, you know, this has probably been done, but you know, make no little plans for they have no magic to stir a man's hearts. Right? Well so this is no little plan. And it is very exciting so I am very encouraged, I'm very encouraged by the changes that have been made. I will also comment that, you know, one of the challenges from Union Station historically has been its size. And I don't mean the fact that it's too small, I mean the fact that it's too large and that the distances that people have to walk to get from a vehicle that delivers them there'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'whether it's a bike, a car or a bus to the tracks has always been too big. I mean, it is indeed a train of magnificent distances. Right? To throw in another quote. Anyway, it's a, but I do think that there had been some very important moves that bring the tracks closer to people so having those entrance points both at the top and then the concourse that connects from one side of the station to the other under the Hopscotch Bridge is a huge improvement and will make it easier to get to a train. And now I will also say I think there are a few things that have been pointed out by some of the other folks who have testified today. The need, you know, to see seating in the station. I mean, I appreciate the fact that they want to show these grand halls and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'lots of room to move around and, you know, chairs, seating, benches, whatever clutter things up. But seating is really important. Especially in a train station where you could be waiting for several hours for your train. And so those sorts of things are, I mean, really do have to be part of what we see in these spaces. And they need to be, they can't just be an afterthought. Right? You can't just go to the catalog and buy a whole bunch of, you know, sturdy seating and fill it up. So try to plan that. The bike station need also mentioned earlier, I mean, I think that, you know, we'll be losing that bike station on the west side of the current station. It's not used at the moment. I guess this is a COVID after effect or at least not very used, but I remember in years'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'past, even with that station there, going to Union Station and not being able to find a place to lock up a bicycle. So I appreciate Commissioner Ginsberg bringing up this issue as well. We need to make sure that there are good places to park bikes and good places that are where people want to put their bikes. Because you know, I'm a cyclist around town. I know Commissioner Ginsberg is as well. And you know, we want to have good access and good connections, but we also don't want to park a block and a half away from the destination. That's the thing about bikes is that you can jam them in and jam them in real close. So make sure there's enough place to park bikes close to where the action is. And let's see, what else? Oh, the bus capacity issue, I think this is a'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'critical moment and we should not be selling short the need for adequate bus space. And it seems to me that the way it's currently configured there might be another way to lay things out to make sure that you get enough bus spaces in there. I mean, this is, you know, you're not going to be able to create new space once you've done this and if you find out that you really do need, you know, 20 or 30 percent more bus bays in order to accommodate all of the needs, you know, the opportunity won't be there so, you know, plan for it now even if it isn't necessarily going to be all used or implemented. I just, I wouldn't want to just see this falling short because I don't think buses are going away any time soon. And yes, I think the last thing I would'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'just mention is that, you know, everything that's happened is great. I agree with so many of the comments that have been said both by the people who testified and my fellow Commissioners. But the overriding message from my perspective is remember this is still a train station and a bus station and don't lose sight of that. Don't let it get confused with the need to have sufficient retail to, you know, pay for this, that or the other thing. I mean, I think too many efforts in the past to revitalize this station, including those in which my agency has been involved, kind of junked it up with other stuff that's not necessary. And I wouldn't want to overdo that stuff and sacrifice the critical means of efficient transit needs. So I've already talked too long, so I'm done. Thank you very much and on to Commissioner Argo.'",

Your comments are always so insightful. Thank you, Commissioner May. I had, this was, I don't know if it was spoken to directly, but indirectly the whole comments about tracks closer to people and the people that they're using, you know, that are using them echoes some of the comments about that. I do have some concerns and I think, I'm trying to remember what Commissioner May said, but something about the main hall and not ignoring the main hall, but remembering that we had that, you know, that beautiful main hall entrance providing some seating capacity. I can't imagine what it would be like without it, but also not and I think the words that he used were not junk it'",

That, I think that's hugely important. I agree with the comments about paying attention to the south as well as the north entrances and not forgetting that entrance and focusing on how that entrance is going to be used and who is going to be using it. I think that I should also add I agree also with the comments about bus capacity and having been, I am a regular bus user for trips to New York and I've taken the train, but I take the bus much more often than I take the train. And it's so much easier for me, I won't even mention it, to go someplace else to get the bus. And at least it has been in'",

I would love to be going to Union Station to get a Megabus or a Vamoose bus or one of the intercity buses that go north from D.C. I think that wraps up my comments and would support yes, the additional slips that are being provided for intercity bus transport. Thank you. This has been not overwhelming, but really stimulating and this is such an important project at such an iconic place. Thank you.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Well a lot of what I would comment on has been said, but a couple of things are worth repeating. First of all, I mean, this is such a major improvement. Commissioner well, Cozart, please make sure that Andrew Trueblood sees the animation. I thought he was going to have an aneurism last time and rightly so. So pushing the parking and the drop off, pick up, all this stuff under the ground does a whole lot of wonderful things not least of which among them is allowing for this east, west -- I just had a panic moment, I'm like is it east, west connectivity that Commissioner Ginsberg referred to. We did spend some time talking about that on the tour and that seems really important. Standing in the H [Street Concourse], what was the word for that? The H, under the ground, the H Street, I don't know'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'what they, how they referred to it, but that was super helpful to understanding the whole thing. As the project progresses, I would urge the sponsors to include links to the animations for the public every time and ask the press coverage also include the animations or links to them in digital press because it's so helpful. This is a complicated project for even, even for people who are used to imagining in three dimensions and who are pretty good at it. So I think that would be helpful. Also I complained about this before, I'm really, and I would urge you to continue to keep doing so and that is for the station and the air rights development to be presented together because presenting them separately just doesn't make any sense. Even if they're, you know, one after the other. Just make sure that there's never one side of'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'the project is not divorced from the other. And then I have to, I can't help myself. After 12 years, it's pretty clear that I'm much more in the design lane than in the planning lane and I, I, I would urge you to ignore the comments that at least I've heard publicly about, you know, actually it was almost, it was rather insulting, that you were unfamiliar with the work of Daniel Burnham and that you should revisit it and look at a more historicist approach to the architecture. Wrong. Couldn't disagree with it more. I think actually one of the things that comes out comes, becomes very clear in the animation as well as the renderings is you're onto something gorgeous for the train hall. And I would encourage you through design development to hew very closely to the aesthetic which you have already established. It might be'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'a little too clean because train stations get dirty, but the architecturally I think there's some illusions almost, some very subtle illusions to Dulles which are beautiful and appropriate and are appropriately lofty and yet still subservient to the station as, I mean, the historic station building as it should be. I think the air rights development has a way to go. In terms of design development, I agree with Commissioner Ginsberg and would caution not only against the seasonal dead zones that you might be creating with so many water features. But they and I get that they're cosmetically making some design allusions to the train station as designed by Grimshaw, but you might be overdoing it. And I think that the practical reality of having that much water, I mean, the engineers in the crowd are going to say, well we can do it, we can do it.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'And that's what they always say. But when you're talking about putting all of these water features on top of what is going to be a consistently vibrating environment, I don't know if that's advisable. And I think on a more pedestrian level, not literally but figuratively, it's going to be a pretty tough sell in the winter with all of those water features either turned off or frozen if they're not skim pools or something like that. So I don't know. I mean, I know at this point, it's just concept so this is a lot of hand wringing about nothing maybe, but the integration of these two aesthetic languages I think could use a little bit more work. But if I had to pick between the two, right now I think I would go with the train shed because I think it hits just the right note and'",

I'm sure that handicap accessibility is going to be dealt with. I didn't hear much about it, but I'm sure that's going to happen. I also am interested in whether or not these new vertical takeoff and landing, I know that there is a restriction in the District of Columbia for air space whereas time goes on, there's going to be a lot of these DTOLs and UAVs and these drone-type devices taking you from one building to the other or from one place to another.

I don't know how many of you all remember that, but it ended up in the foyer. And they had to recover from that and they did and did a lot of improvements then. I also remind myself of the joke that was told about this guy who came up, a person who came to Washington to visit and, of course, he had to go in the Union Station and when he got home he told folks he was just really taken back about Washington, but he didn't know they had a top on it. He didn't ever get out of the station because there was so much going on there for him from a rural town. And I think if he'",

So I'm very excited about it and good luck, and I'm just challenged by the engineering that's going to have to take place to do this work, but we can get to the moon or Mars and all, I'm sure we can make this happen.

First, to thank the Commission members themselves for the thoughtfulness and the careful review and the real attention to the important details that all make such a difference in the millions of people's lives who will pass through this train station and live in those buildings. And I want to thank the team behind this work because we recognize that you did a major reset button from the last time we saw this project. It has changed considerably over the past two years and obviously the effort was well worth it given what you've heard today. These are significant revisions that you've made. They are a game changer and it's had a positive impact on the design. It's the kind of planning and collaboration that we always look to see and that should'",

I agree with Commissioner Wright and we can't help but be designers, but whether we're trained for it or not, but I will say that I really love how modern and open the new train hall feels. And I think it can be an incredible space and I will, I want to echo a few comments. All of the comments I think were relevant and need to be really carefully considered. A couple I want to highlight particularly around the mobility issues and I appreciate Commissioner Cozart and Commissioner Dixon for calling attention to those. And I noted in the video there's one particular scene where you're exiting the building and it shows you going up the staircases and it's a lovely scene, but there's no indication of ramps or an elevator nearby. I'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'agree there were very few examples of people who may be mobility impaired and given the incredible expanse of the space as Commissioner May pointed out, I think those are really important items that need a little more consideration. I also agree about the civic space and the opportunities that are there to bridge some of the places where the community was and is split in two. And I thought Commissioner Ginsberg's ideas were particularly creative in terms of how you work through those issues and make this a very, incredibly positive space. And then, finally, with the issues around the bus parking or transportation and how we work that out, I think it's really important to continue that dialog and keep thinking about the people who are on those buses and what their experience is like and the idea of trying to corral a group of eighth graders. I'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'would not want that job, but I'm glad that people like Ms. Moore and her Guild are so devoted to it because think of their experience from the moment they step off that bus and what it's going to be like for them to navigate that space and celebrate the fact that they're in the nation's capital. So their experience should be first class and any of us passengers should be first class, but I'm particularly focused on those eighth graders. I think that really concludes my remarks.

        "'MR. WEIL': 'Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, Madam Chair White and members of the Commission. The National Park Service, in coordination with the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority or VPRA has submitted preliminary plans to improve a portion of an existing railway corridor that crosses over the George Washington Memorial Parkway over the Potomac River and through East Potomac Park into the southwest commercial area of Washington, D.C. The corridor is an important link in the regional and metropolitan area rail networks with a connection to Union Station which you just heard about in the previous Commission presentation. And here I would like to note that we have made a revision to our staff EDR report that you should have in front of you. It's also been posted to our NCPC website. The previous version incorrectly noted that the new piers and bridge walls crossing the Potomac and through East Potomac Park would'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'be constructed of granite stone. And that was incorrect. It will be the piers and walls will be cladded with a large block ashlar cladding instead. So we did make that revision and posted that to our website and circulated it to you all as well. And with that, I will continue on with my presentation. As a preliminary submission in for comment, we are considering planning issues like landscaping, the project's surrounding context, mitigation, views and view sheds and the projects role in promoting walking and biking in the area. Here is the total 1.8 mile corridor improvement area shown here in yellow which spans between Arlington, Virginia near the Pentagon and L'Enfant Plaza in southwest Washington, D.C. The current project submission includes proposed site improvements to the National Park Service property that would be a part of the larger corridor expansion effort which is highlighted here in purple.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'The Long Bridge Act of 2020 authorized the future conveyance of approximately 4.4 acres of land from the National Park Services to CSX which is highlighted here in yellow. And then VPRA has an agreement to purchase the land for the proposed future rail corridor improvements that are part of the project before us here today. As shown here on this aerial view of the Potomac River, there are currently five bridges that cross the river in this area including the historic existing Long Bridge as the southernmost band and moving to the north upriver, the Charles R. Fenwick Bridge is used by MetroRail Yellow line and then three highway bridges further to the north of that, the Arland D. Williams, Rochambeau, and George Mason Memorial Bridges. The project would connect, construct to a new separate two-track span to the north of the existing Long Bridge outlined here in white'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'as well as a new pedestrian bicycle bridge to the north of that which is outlined here in green. And here is a closer view of the two new river crossings just to the north of the historic Long Bridge. The existing Long Bridge is listed on the National Register for its historic character and is also a contributing element to both the East and West Potomac Parks and George Washington Memorial Parkway historic districts. As such, VPRA has adopted the design approach to approximate the historic features of the existing Long Bridge including its structure, material and form. And this is in an effort to avoid potential adverse effects to the surrounding historic resources that would arise from a less compatible type of bridge design. The existing Long Bridge is a through plate girder bridge with granite piers from Port Deposit, Maryland comprised of 22 through girder stands and'",

The bridge has a total length of approximately 2,530 feet and crosses over the GW Parkway Mount Vernon trail, Potomac River and East Potomac Park. The current structure contains elements of the original 1904 bridge as well as a number of additional improvements that were made in 1942 to accommodate the movement of heavier goods across the river. The current project is the product of a multi-year alternatives analysis study starting in 2011 which assessed a number of potential river crossing alternatives. In addition, the District Department of Transportation and FRA led a comprehensive NEPA study that assessed two different action alternatives eventually selecting alternative A as the preferred alternative which included the construction of one new bridge across the Potomac and preservation of the existing historic Long Bridge. This study concluded with a signed record of decision'",

The purpose of the corridor improvement project is to create greater railroad capacity between Virginia and the District of Columbia while alleviating the rail congestion caused by the existing two track Long Bridge. And this slide shows the plan corridor improvement as part of VPRA's long term effort to enhance passenger rail service throughout the state of Virginia. The National Park Service submission before us here today separates the project area into three geographic segments. And I will go through each area describing the existing conditions, the proposed site improvements and note our comments, recommendations and findings for the project as I proceed along the corridor from west to east. Starting in Virginia with Area One, VPRA would construct a new separate bridge starting from the west of the George Washington Memorial Parkway close to Long Bridge Park and the new bridge'",

Here you can see some photos of the existing Long Bridge over the GW Parkway at the top of the slide and the bridge crossing over Mount Vernon trail on the bottom. And here I would like to note the arched through girder bridge stands that currently cross over the parkway. And this differs from the straight through girder stands over the Mount Vernon trail which continue east for the remainder of the length of the bridge. The new bridge would replicate the arched through girder stands over the parkway as shown in the top rendering and then transition to the straight through girder stands over the Mount Vernon trail to mirror the existing historic Long Bridge structure. The new bridge piers abutments and walls would be constructed of concrete with a broken'",

And this type of treatment would be used throughout the park with the exception of the two bridge piers closest to the Mount Vernon trail which would have columns to increase ground level visibility and safety along the trail and also help preserve the open quality of the park and prevent a tunneling effect for trail users that would occur with the use of solid piers here. Here we can see a closer view of the broken ashlar cladding with its fine pointed stone shapes, coarse pointed accent finish and with a mix of light tan, gold, brown and blue shades and occasional darker interspersed stones. And we include a finding in the Executive Director's Recommendation that supports the use of the ashlar cladding based on its consistency with the character of the historic parkway. As the new rail bridge continues'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'to the east out over the Potomac River, the new bridge would approximate the existing Long Bridge's characteristic structure, material, and form with weathered steel through girders similar to pier spacing and with large blocky piers which would use large block ashlar cladding to approximate the exiting bridge's larger granite block piers. The new bridge would align 40 feet to the north of the existing Long Bridge as shown here in this view looking west back toward Virginia. Staff, NCPC staff concurs with VPRA's overall design approach to approximate the existing bridge's features in an effort to avoid adverse visual impacts to the historic bridge itself or surrounding historic district areas. And we note our support in the final Executive Director's Recommendation. And while we do support VPRA's design approach, we request that VPRA continue to refine the bridge's architectural detailing and consider modifying the size of the new piers'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'to give them a more authentic look similar to the existing Long Bridge piers today. And we include these requests as part of the Executive Director's Recommendation. As the new Long Bridge crossing would be one of seven bridges here in the future, with the Long Bridge's relative position compared to the other three nearby highway bridges, staff finds that the proposed new bridge design is appropriate given its close proximity to the historic Long Bridge. And we note that this would not preclude the opportunity to think more broadly about redesigning the other highway bridges should they be improved in the future. We believe the proposed new bridge design would complement the existing Long Bridge without overwhelming its recognizable historic character. And we note these points in the final Executive Director's Recommendation. In addition to and parallel to the new Long Bridge rail crossing, the project would construct a'",

The new bridge would align approximately 25 feet to the north of the new rail bridge with a prefabricated truss design that is based on its necessary length, required clearances and intended use. The new ped bike crossing was identified as 4F mitigation for the project's required change in land use from federal park land to the railway corridor infrastructure. And the new bridge would be the only free-standing bike ped crossing, only crossing over the Potomac River within the District of Columbia thereby serving as a valuable connection within the larger Arlington and D.C. multimodal networks. Here is a view of the new pedestrian bicycle bridge over the GW Parkway along the north side of the new rail bridge. And here are renderings'",

The VPRA design team is in the process of studying several different color schemes for the new bridge. And here is the bridge, here are the bridges painted with standard department, District Department of Transportation light grey. And here is the bridge painted with Federal standard red. And here is a third color known as Federal standard brown. And these are several initial colors that VPRA is considering'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'for the new pedestrian bicycle bridge. We note, the proposed truss design is based on a number of engineering considerations. It's required length, clearances and intended use and these considerations were reflected in the previous Long Bridge environmental impact statement. However, staff believes that the design still appears to be overly complicated and large in scale with its many side members and vertical side heights which may diminish the user experience for pedestrians and bicyclists as well as other users of East Potomac Park, Mount Vernon trail and the GW Parkway. So staff encourages VPRA to consider ways to lighten the look of the bridge in coordination with NPS, Commission of Fine Arts, D.C. SHPO, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources and NCPC and other stakeholder agencies with potential design modifications that include reducing the size of the bridge elements and painting the structure with a color that better blends'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'in with background features. Finally, as the new bridge is meant to be an important pedestrian and bicycle connection across the river, we believe that VPRA should maximize its width to accommodate future travel with adequate spaced provided directional travel and passing movements. And we reflect this point in the final Executive Director's Recommendation. In follow up to my presentation here today, you will hear testimony that advocates for a wider 20-foot width and one public comment points out the current proposed 14-foot width would effectively be reduced to eight feet of usable width since bicyclists would tend to shy away from the bridge's vertical side elements while riding. And so we hope that with this additional input that VPRA can take another look at the width of the new bridge as they continue to develop this component of the project. Area 3 at East Potomac Park includes the new'",

Here are some photos of the existing railroad bridge today as it crosses over I-395, Ohio Drive East, and the Washington Channel.

And this span would accommodate the new wider combined four-track width with two existing CSX tracks and two new VPRA tracks. And here is the new Washington Channel crossing again with the same through girder design that we saw on the previous slide. And this span would also accommodate the future four-track width. VPRA is committed to constructing the new bridge through East Potomac Park with a design that is compatible with the historic character of the area and as such, VPRA will continue to meet with stakeholder agencies, NCPC, CFA, NPS, DDOT and the D.C.

And we note these points in the final Executive Director's Recommendation. In addition, we recommend that VPRA use ornamental canopy trees, at the bicycle pedestrian entry, exit areas and vehicle parking areas to provide visual interest and shade. And to locate the new trees so that they would allow for intermittent views of new stone-clad walls and also allow for outward views from the railway corridor.

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Welcome.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' -- was a letter from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel that mentioned concern over the construction which isn't so much my question. But also mentioned concerns over the current pedestrian bridge that links the portals project over to the other side of Maine Avenue. And I didn't see any of the slides or in the deck any real detail there so could you maybe tease out a little bit of what the concern is. Like is it going to require tearing down the existing bridge or what's going on there?'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'Sure, absolutely. So first of all, one of the testifiers today, Mr. Grigg, he is a representative of the Portal's property development. He represents Republic Properties and he will speak to the bridge. I think, I believe one of their concerns is they are concerned about the project sequencing. They absolutely would like to see their new bridge fully reconstructed before the existing bridge is demolished. Basically now it's within the limit of disturbance for the widened four-track right-of-way and so that has to be demolished and VPRA does have plans to reconstruct it. Kind of a little further to the south I believe along Maine Avenue so it would still provide a connection to the Portal's development. However, they want to make sure that's done, the new bridge is fully constructed before the old bridge is demolished. And we actually will be covering that segment of the property in'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'September at the Commission meeting.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Okay. That's all for, so is a tear down of the old bridge necessitated by the new train tracks?'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' Sure.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Okay.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' And if you will indulge me, I do have a graphic here that shows in plan view Maine Avenue and here is the new four-track widened bridge over Maine Avenue and this is the existing portals pedestrian only bridge today. And so that would be demolished and the, VPRA would be constructing a staircase and an access ramp up to the new bridge that would cross over Maine Avenue.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Okay and you said that's going to be a separate presentation that we have in the next few months as a --'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' VPRA and DDOT will be, yes, will be submitting that section of the project to NCPC for review at our September meeting next, or in two months.'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Any further questions? Hearing none, we do have correspondence on this project from Nicholas Dubort (phonetic), Cynthia Palmer, Melissa Riggio (phonetic) and Chris Slatt. In addition, yesterday the Commission received 45 public comment letters all in support of a greater width for the bike ped bridge. In addition, we have two people signed up to speak today. First up is Andrea Cowley. Ms. Cowley, you will have three minutes to provide your remarks. Welcome.'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': 'Thank you. My name is Andrea Cowley. I'm a former NASA engineer so not really into bridges usually, but make an exception this time. Yes, the 14 inch or the 14-foot deck I did think would be quite a bit too small. That can be split evenly into two seven-foot lanes, but bicycle handlebars and actually also wheelchair widths are about 800 millimeters or two foot, eight inches. And since the siding rail is 42 inches from the deck, the cyclists have to cycle away from the railing to avoid clipping it and becoming injured. So you might see a much more inward stance than usual especially among novice cyclists or people riding heavy cycles like the CaBi share bikes. Pedestrians also don't tend to walk directly against a bridge rail so that does take up more space. So the passable passing distance of one bicycle in each direction and'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': 'then two passing cyclists, that gives you about six inches of space which is about the same as two credit cards laid together which can be a little daunting at high speeds going towards to each other. So 20 inches, 20 feet is a much better width as it brings us up to 18 inches of space between passing traffic in either direction. The second point is that the bridge deck rail height which I noticed was I can't tell if it's completely separated from the truss structure or not, but it is shown in the drawings as being 42 inches high which is about, which is fine if you're standing. But I went and measured my bicycle seat and my center of mass and that puts me above the safety rail and I have a partner who's nine inches taller than me so her safety factor would just be'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': 'completely gone. She would be going into the truss structure rather than the rail so I would propose to consider adding either some sort of rail structure that is, that goes from the floor to the top or at least reaches to at least like eight feet or something like that to account for the increased center of mass of cyclists. Additionally, that deck rail is perfectly vertical which doesn't allow you full utilization of the deck space. If you have something overhanging, like a bicycle that has, you know, handlebars that hang over the side, you could utilize more deck space by bringing the rails out at a 45 degree angle before bringing them up vertically. I will also say that the bridge is placed between two very loud other bridges. If there's trains going on all the other bridges at the same time, I do worry that it'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': 'would exceed safe noise exposure limits without hearing protection. The Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge has clear barriers in place at least on the Virginia side and they're amazing at blocking out the sound of traffic there. And I would really love to see something like that included on this bridge structure. A clear panel does double duty in that it allows people to see through and see all the views. It doesn't get in the way of the bridge aesthetics, but it's also very, very protective.'",
        "'MR. MORGAN': ' That's three minutes.'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': ' I have one final item if you would grant me just --'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes, continue.'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': ' -- grant me just a little more time.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes.'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': 'Finally, is the east landing there is a double 90 degree turn. I feel this is not very conducive to safety and traffic flow. I would recommend to visit the Mount Vernon trail at the Theodore Roosevelt Island Parking. There's another double 90 degree turn like this and a heavy bicycle or if you're carrying a load, we have a lot of people now I see bicycling around with two or three children or with groceries. It's very difficult to handle that turn and then a flat and then a turn back up a slope. But it appears that there is sufficient space in the parking lot where the bike ped bridge lands to have a full length one to 20 climb without a bend. So I would recommend either removing the bend entirely to allow for better traffic flow or changing it to be a curve instead of a'",
        "'MS. COWLEY': 'double 90 degree turn. So I will stop there.'",

We actually have three so please forgive me. Next is Bernard Berne. Mr. Berne, you will have three minutes for your remarks.'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'Yes, hello. I live in Arlington and I cycle frequently in Washington on the various bridges across the Potomac River. An illustration in the Railroad Authority's submission shows that a bicycle pedestrian bridge will have both ramps and staircases that will connect this bridge to the platform and stairwell within the George Washington Memorial Parkway onto Ohio Drive on the East Potomac Park. These connections will be located inside environmentally sensitive areas within or very close to public rivers of research protection area, RPA. They are mostly incompatible with use of these national parks for protecting state watersheds says new construction here within the RPAs must be closely monitored and limited to the greatest extent feasible. Such limitations are also necessary within some of the other areas of the national parks including the George Washington National Parkway and East Potomac Park. In 1987, the sidewalks on the key bridge were'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'widened to 10 feet. The bicycle pedestrian bridge on the Wilson, Woodrow Wilson bridge which opened in 2009 is four feet wide. The paths on both of these bridges are wide enough for safe pedestrian and can be used by cyclists and by other motor scooter users, operators even during peak hours. I have experience with all these bridges frequently. I don't have problems on them. The paths on, wider paths are hazardous and as users often spread out to walk and to cycle side by side and the wide widths encourage cyclists to speed especially on downhill slopes as those ramps. This is dangerous. There is no real need for both wide ramps and wide staircases to connect the bridge and a street within this RPA in national parks. Few people will use this stairs, if any. They're going to use the ramps. In addition, of course, a lot'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'of people are going to use the George Mason Bridge. The ramps and stairs which increase stormwater runoff into the Potomac River and will detract from the views of the river and the parks. I therefore ask you to please vote to one, recommend the remove of the stairs containing the bicycle pedestrian bridge and the Mount Vernon trail and the Ohio Drive. Those stairs are simply redundant and no one will use them. Reduce the width of the ramps connecting the bridges and the trail and drive to 13 feet. Again, because that's sloped and people speeding down the slope if you're walking by the side, man, it's dangerous. That is all that is necessary to provide safe and convenient connections between the bridge and the drive. However, if implemented, if there's a design it would be a classic example of overbuilding and overengineering within the Washington area's national'",

We've written comments and spoken with NCPC staff. And you have comments from, which are provided, by one of our property owners, the Mandarin, which included a letter that I wrote to CFA.

Obviously a critical linkage and, you know, continued development on a mass transit throughout the east coast not just in the Washington D.C. area. So the overall project I've got no comments on. As one of the cyclists, I guess on the Commission, I've got a couple of comments on the cycle bridge. I don't have a whole lot of objections to the size and the design. I think as pointed out by one of the members of the public who commented that the height is important. I suspect the height's okay, but frankly that's going to - I guess as some of the issues staff had in terms of the visual of that truss I suspect is necessary. But I do, am concerned about is the, at the end points, the bridge at both ends.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'Certainly the way you've tied it into the parkway. The bike trail is critical because right now it's very hard to get to, you know, the 14th Street bridge on a bicycle and across, you know, in connection side from Virginia so that's a major improvement as it ties into Crystal City through the Long Bridge Park which will increase the traffic. So I'm concerned about a 90 degree terminus there. I'm also concerned about the terminus at the District side there on Ohio Street. There's no pedestrian, really facilities on that side of Ohio Drive. They have it terminating. It comes to a T itself there so I'd almost recommend it take a look at carrying that bridge across Ohio Drive and maybe down into that parking lot to tie into existing pedestrian passageways. Don't know whether the 14 feet is the right number or not, but certainly as'",

        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yes, thank you. So I'll make a few comments. The, first of all you know, we've been working the VPRA for a very long time on this project. And the design element has already come a long way, but it's still got a ways to go before it's really complete. There are details having to do with the design of piers and planting and things like that I think that need some further development. And we are working through that with the VPRA, their design team. The new bike and pedestrian bridge is a critical component of the project. I mean that's one of the reasons why we were able to support this in the first place creating that connection across the river improving a vital connection for bikes for example. Because right now the connection across 14th Street bridge is not very good. And so this will be a'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'huge improvement in that regard. I do think that there are a number of the details there that still need to be worked out. Some of those were highlighted in the testimony that we heard today. I do think some of those issues are already addressed in the design or will be. Not everything is clear from the amount of information that's been presented today. There is further development that I think that addresses some of the safety concerns with the design. And I will say also, I mean, this is very important to us, not just for providing a commuter route, but providing a way for our visitors on the George Washington Memorial Parkway to connect to national and memorial parks on the other side of the East Potomac Park. So it is a big, big benefit from our perspective. It is a major project in support of the'",

Anyway, it's a component or it supports the national capital region, National Park Service paved trail plan that we developed many years ago and we are looking forward to further development and making sure that this works for everyone who's involved in it. I don't know, I mean I maybe somebody from the VRPA wants to address some concerns that came up today. I'm not sure that there are specific answers, but you may want to give an opportunity to Kate to respond to that.'",

We have developed the details based on what we thought was best practice and really looked at a lot of design criteria to address all the comments that were already brought up today, but happy to take those back and discuss more with the project team and react and adapt to appropriately for the design.'",
        "'MS. CLEVELAND': 'And also I've been looking at impacts of widening the bridge based on the main comments that we received, and so that will change some studies. So we'll be able to get back to you, though, with what we are able to accommodate. Obviously, the corridor is very narrow, and we have to fit two bridges in between an existing, you know, railroad, and then we'll modernize the existing this existing Yellow Line bridge. So we'll see what's possible, and then we'll have the whole report back to you. Then regarding Mr. Grigg's testimony, we are meeting with him. We have our third, well, I think, fourth meeting this year. Three since I've started in March.

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Perfect. Well, Commissioner Argo, we'll move onto Commissioner Wright while they address the technical issue, and we'll come back to you. So Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, I just have what, I mean, what everyone else has said. But also, Michael, can you take us to what was slide 35 in the original deck?'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' Sure.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'So or there abouts. It shows, and several people have commented this, but this really struck me, not as a -- whoop, that back up, back up, hold on, keep going, one more. Well, that's a good one. Okay. Can you blow up this slide? So the bottom image. What I'm getting at is it's a study in contrast. Aesthetically this thing is too heavy handed in some places, and then what really struck me were these little weirdo, you know, very slight fences. They look like those, kind of, temporary fences that are set up at events, and they look particularly frail, and sort of silly in contrast to these heavy trusses. And I would just urge that you think again. I think Commissioner McMahon mentioned how these things -- I have no objection to the bridge forms themselves and the trusses. The truss work is beautiful in some'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'ways, but the contrast with how each bridge lands on both banks, is really disconcerting and I think could use a little -- that's another good one. The one I had in mind was this lower right hand, also right where you see the staircase and these very, sort of, dainty pickets. And I don't know. They almost, again, look like those temporary event fences which conjure up all kinds of associations that are unpleasant. So I would urge that you think through this a little bit how each structure hits the ground, and the contrast between the trusses. The piers are fine, and I don't have a -- I think the color is, I mean, I actually learned something today. I didn't know there was a federal brown and a federal red, and a D.C. gray. So I mean, I don't -- I'm not particularly picky about any of'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'that. This is just the one thing that struck me kind of uniformly throughout the presentation that there's a certain amount of discord in aesthetics to the -- where each of the bridges land on the ground on either bank. That's it.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I'm okay. I have nothing to add. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Just a few things. So I do -- now that I've heard the testimony and gone back and looked at those images we were just looking at of the landing on the Virginia side, I will say I don't really see the point so much of the stairs because it seems to unnecessarily elongate the bridge just to then go back when it could just gently land over there. So I'd urge looking at that. I just don't see that they would ever get used because it's actually a longer walk both ways, and it's really high up, like those are a lot of stairs going up. So and I agree with everything else that has been said about the pedestrian bridge and I appreciate that you're only at what, 15 percent design, and you're going back and looking at that. And also on the D.C. side, just to the'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'questions that I had earlier, and I know that we'll looking at this now separately, but I really would encourage between now and when we hear this and as plans go forward, that we really address the concerns of this bridge, this pedestrian bridge connecting the Portals, to the other side because I think that's a major D.C. development, and it's an amenity that was built there by that project in 2004. So I just want to make sure that those folks are happy to the greatest extent possible. So as we move to that next review, I'll look forward to that. And then, finally, I just want to acknowledge that this is, kind of, a strange project because we have Virginia facilities that will be very much coming into D.C. As soon as you cross the river out of Virginia, remember you're in D.C. So it's an interesting project'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'that I understand will have some swaps of some land or some purchases of land, especially on the D.C. side. And I just hope that as there are issues that are raised on the D.C. side from either our planners or DDOT and all that, that the Virginia pass through railway folks work really hard to make sure that the D.C. people are as happy as possible. So that's really all the comments, but I think that it is a great project moving forward. It's a vital transportation link for the District. And I think that adding the pedestrian facilities and bike facilities really adds a lot to this. So thanks.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Just maybe VPRA can address this issue of the stairs on the Virginia's side, or perhaps Arlington County. It looks like Commissioner May may have even more better information with his daytime job. Because if I take a look and just a look at those comments on the bridge -- the pedestrian bridge, keep in mind that if you are a pedestrian coming from the Long Bridge area coming up the pedestrian bridge starting down at the new Recreation Center, it's actually a fitness center that Arlington County built, you're not going to walk all the way, you know, across over the Potomac River and make that turn and walk back down the bicycle ramp. You're going to want to take those stairs going down to the parkway of, you know, a multi-use trail, which is heavily used by pedestrians in addition to the cyclists. That's all. Thanks.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I was essentially going to make the same point. What is not clear from the visualizations that are shown in the presentation is that the stairway is, you know, will be very convenient for the next component of the bridge because that bridge continues across the George Washington Memorial Park already and it's a long bridge. So yeah, I mean, it will be used by people who are walking, and even if you're on a bike you'd have to go all the way down and double back. But it's not -- we can't get by, I think, without that stairway.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' And I'll just say I'm now going back and looking at it at a different angle, and it makes more sense from a different angle.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, okay.'",

        "'MS. CLEVELAND': ' I was basically going to say the same thing, so.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Great. Everyone's in concurrence. Are there any further comments or questions? I would just like to add that it's interesting we have this significant infrastructure project, a few today, on the agenda. And a very important one for both rail capacity, and as everyone has noted, the pedestrian and the biking capacity. There are a lot of different segments to these improvements. A lot of considerations, the impact on the Portals, the historic preservation, and while we're in this design phase and only at 15 percent, it does seem that the overall approach is going in the right direction. That as we saw with the last presentation, these details are really important. And I appreciate and encourage VPRA to keep looking at this question about the proposed width and design of the new bike-ped bridge. And I'm very sensitive to the dynamics of building trails. That's what I do in'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'my day job, and I have 130 miles open to the public in widths of trails and what's beside those trails is a really important consideration. So I appreciate you taking a strong look at this. There's a lot of debate in this world about if you widen them, people will go faster, if they're too narrow, you'll have more accidents, but in thinking about mobility and pedestrian cycles, people in wheelchairs, it's a really important thing to get right when you have such a constrained space. I also wanted to echo what Commissioner Wright was saying about at least how the rendering's come across with that very light touch of a rail when you're coming off of the bridge and you're adjacent to moving cars. I do encourage you to take a stronger look at that from a pedestrian safety point of view. Not just the aesthetic, but the'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'safety aspects that are involved there. So it's all about the user experience. It's great that we have so many users on our Commission to give you first-hand experience as to what that is like. So I appreciate, again, the thoughtfulness of our Commission Members, and the coordination to date and to the staff for working through this, and frankly, to the 45 people who have sent in letters and our folks who showed up to give testimony because I think community engagement we are always advocating for that, so it's really heartening to see this kind of response to this project.

Arlington National Cemetery has submitted a Draft Master Plan for Commission comment. The Commission last approved a Master plan for ANC in 2015. ANC is a 639 acre cemetery located in Arlington County, Virginia, surrounded by major roadways, joint based Myer Henderson Hall, developed areas of Arlington County, and lands under this jurisdiction of the National Park Service. As a reminder, the Commission approved two expansions to the cemetery in the last few years. The Millennium Expansion was approved in 2015 with construction completed in 2019, and the subject expansion received its final approval from the Commission in 2021. Both of these expansions will provide ANC much need burial capacity. I will also note that in'",

ANC had used the land under a memorandum of agreement, but not it is fully under ANC's jurisdiction. Today approximately, 400,000 veterans and their eligible dependents are buried at ANC. Service members from every one of America's major wars, from the Revolutionary War to today's conflicts, are interred at the cemetery. ANC hosts over three million visitors annually and almost six thousand funerals. The cemetery staff is comprised of, roughly, 200 federal workers, 80 military personnel, and up to 300 contract support staff. At the draft review for its Master Plan for a facility such as'",

Staff analyzed this draft using guidance from the comprehensive plan, particularly those related to the parks and open space, preservation and historic features, and federal transportation elements. The staff finds the proposed Draft Master Plan is consistent with the comprehensive plan. The purpose of the Master Plan is to assist ANC in addressing the changes that have occurred since the last Master Plan was approved in 2015, and to address new challenges and opportunities for the cemetery. This draft plan does not propose any additional expansions of the cemetery outside its current boundaries. The proposed projects identified in the draft are notional with potential locations identified, but no specific massing, scale, or designs included at this time. The Draft Master Plan was informed by four primary goals identified by ANC'",

Those include maximizing available space to extend the life of the cemetery, modernize and expand existing facilities and infrastructure to enhance the cemetery operations, enhance the visitor experience while maintaining the iconic image of the cemetery, and maintaining a safe and secure operating environment. The Draft Plan divides the cemetery into four area development plans or ADPs, which we'll use for discussion. They include the Entry Corridor, the Memorial Amphitheater, the Service Complex, and the Meigs Tanner area near Arlington House. A fifth area is the Soldiers and Airmen's Home National Cemetery, which is actually located within the District of Columbia, and it's included in discussion under this draft as it is under ANC's purview and maintenance. I will go through each of the ADPs noting proposed projects called out in the draft plan and include our recommendations. In preparing the Draft Master'",

WEBB': 'Plan, ANC undertook a thorough process to identify problems and challenges particularly related to the visitor experience and pedestrian safety, as well as addressing pedestrian and vehicular conflicts. The first area we'll look at is the Area Development Plan One, which is the Entry Corridor, and this area includes Memorial Avenue, the Main Entrance to the cemetery, the Welcome Center, WIMSA Memorial, the Visitor Parking Garage, and the Administration Building. Under this draft, most of the proposed future projects involving new structures are located in ADP 1, and include projects to address, excuse me, to address pedestrian and vehicular conflicts and enhancing the visitor experience. It also includes security-related projects such as a new standalone Pedestrian Security Facility to the east of the Welcome Center, a new Vehicular Screening Facility along Memorial Avenue, and one at the Visitor Parking Garage. Other projects identified for ADP 1 include potential new columbarium'",

For ADP 1, staff supports the applicants' efforts to identify projects that improve the visitor experience, security, and eliminate existing pedestrian and vehicular conflicts. The new Visitor Screening Facility, east of the Welcome Center, will allow the Welcome Center itself to better function as a place for visitors to seek information on the cemetery. The new drive into the Visitor Parking Garage and the vehicular screening will help eliminate the existing pedestrian and vehicular conflicts around the Welcome Center that exists. Staff supports the applicant's intent to reconfigure the Tram Space, excuse me, the Tram Plaza and queuing area to further enhance the visitor experience and avoid pedestrian and vehicular conflicts. However, staff does find that proposed vehicular screening on Memorial Avenue is problematic as any permanent structure would impact the historic character of Memorial Avenue. Therefore, staff recommends that the'",

WEBB': 'applicant explore options for mobile vehicle screening on Memorial Avenue that are not permanent and do not negatively impact the historic character and the views shared at Memorial Avenue, including fully mobile units that can be removed when the cemetery is closed. In addition, staff finds that the applicant has proposed these flex area spaces, to the north of Memorial Avenue behind the existing fencing and holly hedge rows, that could accommodate various facilities and possibly new columbarium. These areas north and south of Memorial Avenue behind the holly hedges are documented contributing landscape features for the Arlington Memorial Bridge and Arlington's National Register Historic District. Therefore, staff recommends that the applicant avoid siting any future columbarium area or any new structures in the areas identified as flex space, and here is a picture showing the area north of Memorial Avenue, as any development may impact the mature oak trees'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'and the character of these landscape features. Staff recommends that the applicant identify other areas in ADP 1 that may serve as desired flex space and may be more appropriate for future developments such as needed columbarium. The next area we will discuss is ADP 2, which is the Memorial Amphitheater ADP, which covers an area in the southwestern part of the cemetery. It contains the Memorial Amphitheater and Reception Building, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and considerable burial space particularly to the south and west of the Memorial Amphitheater and also includes, of course, the grounds around the Amphitheater. Proposed projects in ADP 2 are primarily to improve mobility and ADA access, and the visitor experience as well as interior space reconfigurations at the Amphitheater to improve functionality. Therefore, staff recommends that the Commission supports the rehabilitation projects and improvements and visitor experience, including enhanced grave finding, new'",

The next ADP is the Service Complex, and the area for the Service Complex ADP actually spans the entire cemetery which makes it different from the other ADPs we've discussed. Staff notes that the existing Service Complex adjacent to the southern expansion in this area shown here, will be demolished to provide additional space for burials for the cemetery. The purpose of this ADP is to examine the broader reassignment of the Service Complex functions across the cemetery. Staff finds that the draft plan identifies areas to improve functions of necessary service in construction needs while recognizing the limitations of space within the cemetery. In particular, the plan proposes to convert the north parcel, which is in this area, which is a 2.3 acre parcel under ANC's jurisdiction adjacent to Joint Base Myer-'",

Due to this location and potential for full screening from any visitors, staff supports locating new laydown and storage yards in the north part of the parcel as it is a location separated from visitor access areas. In addition, due to the solemn character of the cemetery, staff recommends the applicant ensure that any other new areas for service functions and laydown areas identified are not located within cemetery areas with sensitive viewsheds or adjacent to burial sites. The next area is ADP 4 which is termed the Meigs-Tanner ADP located in the northwestern portion of the cemetery and lies west of the President John F. Kennedy grave site in Arlington House, and which Arlington House serves as one of the primary guest destinations for visitors to this cemetery. This area also includes Sherman Drive, which is immediately to the west of Arlington'",

For ADP 4 the plan includes opportunities to improve the visitor experience and safety with grave finding, visitor stations, improved sidewalk access, expanded tram stops, and traffic improvements. Staff supports the opportunities to improve the visitor experience and safety within the cemetery where feasible and appropriate and in the areas controlled by ANC. However, staff notes that some of the proposed projects in this ADP may conflict with the existing National Park Service operations and cultural landscape features and would require NPS review and approval. In their comments, NPS noted that Building 313 was already under their jurisdiction prior to the 2020 land swap, with only Building 314 coming under their jurisdiction in 2020.

As I mentioned earlier in the presentation, the draft plan does include the Soldiers' and Airman's Home National Cemetery, which is located in the District as it is under ANC's purview. It is one of the oldest national cemeteries in the United States containing 16 acres and is located immediately northeast of the Armed Forces Retirement Home. Future projects identified in the Draft Master Plan include the rehabilitations of buildings such as the Superintendent's Lodge and finding more active uses for these historic buildings.

Staff commends the applicant in identifying a key goal of the Draft Master Plan is to reduce the pedestrian and vehicular conflicts along Memorial Avenue and within the cemetery. Staff recommends that the applicant continue to identify ways to improve and support bus and tram use and the Metro for workers and visitors, alike. Finally, staff recommends that the applicant explore opportunities to improve the tram service from the Metro Station to the Welcome Center to assist visitors with mobility issues. In'",

I do appreciate also the particular attention that's been given to the concerns that the Park Service has already expressed to the Cemetery, and potential conflicts with our operations at Arlington House, the fact that certain actions will need our approval as they are currently envisioned.

So we really want to make sure that the leadership of Arlington National Cemetery pays close attention to what our visitors will need because, frankly, our visitors in many cases are their visitors as well, so.

There are ways to do this well, and I think that there has to be some very strong attention around getting that right and keeping it as minimal as it possibly can be and still be safe. And then the last think I want to mention, is just to underscore again one of the staff comments having to do flex space just north of Memorial Avenue where, you know, that's -- those are -- it's a fully designed landscape for Memorial Avenue with the allees of trees that line that area. And granted,'",

And I also want to thank you for providing the Commission with a great field trip. I regret I was unable to attend, but I did hear from those who attended that it was really very helpful to see all the nuances of the plan and understand the issues that you're trying to resolve as you move forward.

Staff found this proposal complies with some of these recommendations regarding seeking early consultation with NCPC staff, completing a survey of existing trees, incorporating and providing alternative environmental compensation measures earlier in the design process, and continuing coordination with Fairfax County. Staff also found additional information is necessary to address the Commission's action regarding prioritization of off and on site tree replanting, locating the facility on previously disturbed land to the greatest extent possible, and providing'",
        "'MR. HART': 'quantitative data demonstrating how the alternative environmental compensation will be equal to the loss of trees on the site.

We support these items because they are generally within the 26- acre boundary identified in the recently approved ADP because its size doesn't allow it to be located in areas A or B from the ADP, and it has been decided not to disturb on-site wetlands'",
        "'MR. HART': 'or stream valleys. You can see that the wetlands are identified here. There's one to the north, and then there are two that are located here, south of the building. The stream valleys are the purple areas with the stream one's being the blue. The staff's main concern with the Distribution Center proposal is because of the amount of tree removal that's proposed in Area D has increased. It was 26 acres in the final ADP that you approved in March, and it's nearly 40 acres as described here. Although the Army didn't provide a tree removal and protection plan, they did provide a tree stand delineation plan, and a map showing where trees will be removed. They've also provided the Fort Belvoir tree removal and protection policy, which is applicable to this project. It's identified here on the first bullet. They note that the Accotink Lake will be an'",
        "'MR. HART': 'offsite area to receive some of the trees that will be removed, which is a result of the continued coordination between the Army and Fairfax County. Unfortunately, they didn't describe how many trees will be planted at Accotink Lake, and that's the information that we'd like to understand. In addition, some of the trees will be needed to be removed because of the perimeter fence, which I'll discuss in an upcoming slide, and you can see the fence line here that's, kind of, reddish line that's shown here. In order to understand the added impacts on forested areas, the staff overlayed the new plan on the Area D outline. And just so that you're understanding this, the blue dotted line is the new plan which is proposed now. The purple line that's shown here is what was the delineation for the Area D in the ADP. The outline is shown'",
        "'MR. HART': 'here is helpful, and I'll switch to a black and white image so that you can see where the areas are that are additional tree removal. And it appears the difference is a result of a few things being larger than anticipated, the parking area to the north, as well as the main entry area to the east. In addition there's the alignment of the perimeter fence. Therefore, staff requests the U.S. Army to reevaluate how more trees can be preserved either by reducing the size and configuration of the parking lots, interior roads, and building footprints. So next we get to the perimeter fence impacts on the forested areas. The perimeter fence project itself includes a three-foot wide swath with a ten-foot pathway within it. It also includes lighting and monitoring devices along the fence line. The perimeter fence was not described in the ADP, and as I noted,'",
        "'MR. HART': 'it includes the removal of trees. It does cross a few streams, and there are potential impacts to those. We haven't received much information on this fence and aren't sure this alignment which has environmental impacts is necessary. While we haven't received this information, we are requesting the Army to provide additional information regarding why it is needed in an already secured campus, the number of trees that will be removed for the fence, and how the fence proposal will be altered to reduce the amount of tree loss and impacts to streams and wetlands. As there are a significant number of trees being removed and there are limited areas to plant new trees on the campus, the Army noted it would provide alternative environmental compensation to offset the loss of the trees. These measures include locations offsite to replant trees at a 2:1 ratio, the consideration of solar and/or'",
        "'MR. HART': 'wind powered generation installations on and off posts, the implementation of stream restoration on Fort Belvoir, and/or stream restoration mitigation, excuse me, and/or stormwater restoration in our mitigation issues through the post. The staff report notes the Army has committed, as part of the final ADP in March, to alternative environmental compensation measures to mitigate tree loss because of the future development at the FBNA. However, it's unclear how much of the proposed solar panels are mitigation for the tree loss, as no information was provided describing the tree removal and replacement plan. The staff recommends that the Commission requests the Army to submit a tree replacement plan. A requirement for the Commission's preliminary review that addresses the following: The number of trees removed and how the replacement ratio of 2:1 tree for every tree removed will be met on on or offsite with a priority for onsite planting; An'",
        "'MR. HART': 'identification of onsite preservation areas and areas for replanting; and then, finally, an analysis that demonstrates how additional environment compensation measures will equal the loss of trees removed. The final ADP indicated that new facilities are intended to support onsite renewable energy production and that the installation should consider this during the project review stage. The Army noted the proposed Distribution Center will include solar panels on the building rooftop, green roofs on other portions of the rooftop, solar canopies over the surface parking spaces, as well as eight percent of the parking spaces will be equipped with electrical vehicle charging stations. Under the current proposals, new facilities would be constructed to a standard of LEED silver, and staff supports this designation as we find the Army is prioritizing renewable energy by incorporating the alternative environmental compensation measures that I've already described. The staff acknowledges that the applicant has provided'",
        "'MR. HART': 'some limited information regarding stormwater management. You see the stormwater management plan here. However, as staff notes, there is insufficient information to understand how the project will address stormwater management, the alternate providing some onsite below grade storage. And finally, there are 450 parking spaces proposed for the Distribution Center's 600 employees and government vehicles. The ADP however, identified the number of distribution center employees as 650, and the amount of parking for the facility was between 436 and 390 spaces which were for the nearer term and long term. This would equal a parking ratio of either 1 to 1:5 in the nearer term, or 1 to 1:7 in the long term. And as this proposal includes 600 employees and 200, like, new employee parking spaces, the proposed facility would have a parking ratio of 1 to 1:5. It is unclear to staff how the installation will achieve a'",
        "'MR. HART': '1:2 parking ratio given this proposal will have a parking ratio that is less than that. And then while staff understands that parking may be necessary here as it's located far from the existing development at the FBNA, the entire installation will still need to meet the 1:2 long term parking ratio goal as described and approved in the Master Plan. And the staff also reminds the Army, the Commission's March approval requested the Army to return in two years with an update to the TMP to demonstrate, among other things, how the TDM strategies will help if the installation can achieve a 1:2 parking ratio goal in the long term. And with that, it is the Executive Director's Recommendation that the Commission support the following elements of the distribution center complex: The high bay warehouse, the three-story administration building, the truck maintenance refueling building, the covered enclosed storage buildings,'",
        "'MR. HART': 'and the utility yard. And defers support for the two surface parking lots with 450 spaces, the entry control facility, and the perimeter fence until additional information is submitted for review. As I've already incorporated the rest of the recommendations into my presentation, I won't repeat them here. I'm available for any questions, as are representatives from Fort Belvoir. This concludes my presentation, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you so much, Mr. Hart. Are there any questions for Mr. Hart or the applicants? (No oral response.)'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Hearing none, I will now open it up to the Commission for discussion if everyone would turn on your cameras and keep them on during deliberation. I will start with Commissioner McMahon and then go in round robin format. So first, Commissioner McMahon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Okay, thanks. I actually do have one question. Do we have the applicant here today?'",

        "'MR. HART': ' Sure.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' I'll start with Mr. Hart first. Looking at the TMP and those requirements and the way the brief is put together, is the intention from the Commission staff is that the Area D of North Area is going to be handled separately or is that part of an overall TMP for Fort Belvoir North Area?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' It's, in a way, separate because its functionality is very different from the campus core. You know, the campus core is of administrative nature. The Distribution Center is legitimately that. It is a Distribution Center with very different transportation requirements than the campus core. But we're more than willing to increase that information as the design progresses. And along with the new information on the two parking lots, those are intended to be light handed to speak to earlier, so that there isn't a lot of earth moving that has to happen. And but we're more than happy to continue to provide you information as time progresses.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Okay. And I look forward to your next -- your team and your part of the Master Plan where you committed to meet in the next two years. Okay. I really had no other comments on the plan itself. I think the recommendations are solid, and I think there is time in this project for Fort Belvoir to respond to them before they move forward and come see us again.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yeah, I don't have a lot to add. I think the EDR sums up the major concerns and, I just would want to underscore the issues with regard to tree removal and the perimeter fence development, how that will be. I would also just want to mention, I mean, there was one perspective rendering toward the end, which showed an overall view of the facility, and it's a lot of roads, and a lot of grass, and some pancake buildings, and really, that's not great. And I think, you know, they could be a little more creative in how they treat the landscape, at the very least. But you still need to have all that road, and you still need to have those large flat buildings, then some, you know, something other than grass because grass is not the most sustainable thing. I mean, it's cheap and it's easy, and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'I understand there may be benefits from the security perspective from things like that, but, you know, could you be thinking about meadow plantings or things that might spark some more pollinators, I mean, there's just, it can be a little bit more creative than that. So that's it. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' I appreciate the opportunity to see this, and I don't have additional comments. I think that, you know, anything that we can, you know, anything that they can do to keep that parking ratio where we've asked them to keep it, making sure that they have that incorporated tightly into their plans, I'd appreciate it. I don't have any other comments. Thank you.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, I have a -- it was kind of a question, and I'm almost afraid to ask it, but I'm going to go ahead. Carlton, you said something about a thirty-foot swath at the perimeter fence. Is that a requirement, and how come? A swatch of what? I mean, because --'",
        "'MR. HART': ' It's a --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Go ahead.'",
        "'MR. HART': ' Yeah, it's a, basically, what we've been told is that it's a three foot wide area that they need clear, and a ten foot wide pathway within that. So it's about the fence. Basically, it's for the fence.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' So they need it clear for construction or for visibility for security reasons after the perimeter fence is in?'",
        "'MR. HART': ' My understanding is it is for after. It may be for security for visibility.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' For visibility, okay. Which brings me to Mr. May's comment, which I second, about the grass. There's a lot of stuff you can do that won't interfere with site lines, and might even discourage, what's the word, trans, not transgressing, what's -- you know what I mean, crossing it. (Laughing.)'",
        "'MR. HART': ' Oh, yes, yes. Traversing.'",

        "'MR. HART': ' I know.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' So I think anything but grass, would cut down on your maintenance, would not interfere with your site lines and would also just be prettier. And not to mention, yes, the pollinators, you know, the bees would love you. And it would just be cut down on a lot of greenhouse gas from cutting all that grass.'",

We know it's a necessary function. So I do want to just echo the comments about the impact to the trees, that it will be an extensive impact. And I really want to stress how important it is to continue working as you have to think about replacement and other environmental mitigation in addition to seeing that the footprint is as small as it can be. Taking to heart, Mr. May's comments about creativity. There's a lot of interesting work going on in the private sector with distribution centers and green roofs and, you know, I would welcome an exploration of those ideas to mitigate the impact.

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' The last item on our agenda is an information presentation on the New Smithsonian Museums Site Evaluation Study, and today we'll be hearing from Mr. Flis. Welcome back.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': ' Thank you, and good afternoon again. Let me make sure I can --hopefully, you can see that?'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': 'We can, but we also see all of the frame. Oh, there it goes. Yeah, it looks good. MR. FLIS. There you go. Great. Thank you. So the purpose of today's information presentation is to provide an update on the Smithsonian Institution's Site Evaluation Study for two new museums. The National Museum of the American Latino and the American Women's History Museum. This study will cover both museums and is occurring concurrently. You saw an introduction to this process back in December of 2021, followed by an update and review of the candidate sites in March. So just as a reminder, the legislation establishes that the Smithsonian organization should identify sites by December of 2022. The legislation also requires that the Board of Regents consult with, among others, the Chair of NCPC, so NCPC has an advisory role in this effort. Generally, in the past and with the most recent'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': 'museum, the Chair has provided letters with recommendations and comments to the Board of Regents. We do expect that they will return to the Commission for a final briefing in September of this year with some additional analysis, which I'll talk about a little bit later. And then, of course, following site selection, NCPC, pursuant to the Planning Act, will have review authority over this site and building plans for the museums. So I mentioned in March you saw 14 Tier 1 sites that had been identified from the original 26 sites you saw previously. The Smithsonian has identified four focus sites, and of those three you saw previously, and one new site which they'll talk a little bit about in further detail today. So with that as background, I'm going to turn it over to Ron Cortez, Under Secretary for Administration with the Smithsonian. He will provide some remarks'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': 'and introduce the rest of their team. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'Thank you, Mr. Flis, and good afternoon, Madam Chair and members of the Commission. As Mr. Flis mentioned, we are here today for what will be the third of four briefings to your Commission as our evaluation of sites progresses. We appreciate your including us on your packed agenda today. As you can see on the agenda, we will provide the following: Museum updates, an update on our site evaluation process, and discuss next steps with you. And we're very anxious to receive feedback and comments that we can incorporate into the process. And as Mr. Flis mentioned, we will plan to be back here in September to respond to questions and feedback that you have from us here today. So with this, I will go ahead and turn this over. So before we provide an update on our evaluation study, I would like to briefly introduce our museum directors,'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'who we are very proud of, and who will update you on some of our recent activities. First of all, we have Lisa Sasaki, our interim director at the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum, and Jorge Zamanillo, recently hired, who joined the Smithsonian as the director of the National Museum of the American Latino from his previous position as director and CEO of the HistoryMiami Museum, and he will say a few words. First, I'd like to introduce Lisa Sasaki. Lisa?'",
        "'MS. SASAKI': 'Thank you very much, Ron. Good afternoon, Madam Chair, and members of the Commission. I have been honored to be working on the building of the foundations of the new American Women's History Museum which will amplify the accomplishments of American women, the history they've made, and that made them, and the communities that they represent. The museum is committed to chronicling the millions of stories that exist throughout out past and present so that they can education and inspire future generations. One of the most significant first steps that has happened since I was asked to serve as interim director, has been to work with the museum's advisory council and developing their recommendations to the Smithsonian Regents surrounding the selection of a site. Depicted here on the next slide is a photo of the Women's History Museum Council when they visited potential sites on March 30th. The National Museum'",
        "'MS. SASAKI': 'of the American Latino and the Smithsonian Board of Regents have also toured the sites this spring. I'm not going to take up too much time because I know you have had a very long day, so I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to my colleague, Jorge Zamanillo, so he can say a few words about the National Museum of the American Latino.'",
        "'MR. ZAMANILLO': 'Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, Madam Chair, and members of the Commission. I look forward to working with you over the next many years in the realization of our new museum. I'm honored to join the Smithsonian team and take on this incredible opportunity. Two weeks ago, I joined the leadership of the Smithsonian, the National Museum of American Latino, the Molina family, and the First Lady of the United States, and President Joe Biden, in opening the Molina Family Latino Gallery as a National Museum of American History. This gallery is the first generation of the National Museum of the American Latino, and provides a preview of the Latino Museum's potential, and how visitors can envision the museum. The Molino Family Latino Gallery inaugural exhibition, Presente: a Latino History of the United States, introduces critical conflicts, moments, and biographies that shine a light on a historical and cultural'",

        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'Thank you, Jorge. Next slide. We would like to update you on our progress and evaluate the potential sites for the two museums. It's been a very thorough process, and one in which we take pride in taking feedback into the process. The next slide. As you recall at the March meeting, we shared that our initial due diligence had characterized the 26 sites into our list of Tier 1 sites, those with greater potential for a new museum, and tier two sites, those with limited or no potential for the new museums. Following the meeting, one additional site was added for consideration and evaluation. Since then, site visits have been conducted with the Smithsonian Board of Regents, the Smithsonian of the American Women's History Museum Council, and then lastly, the Museum of the American Latino Board. In addition we've held numerous outreach meetings to members of different congressional staff,'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'and the Women's Caucus, Congressional Caucus, and a number of other stakeholder groups. In addition, we focused on qualitative feedback and quantitative feedback, we conducted a national survey which generated input, represented input from across the country from the public regarding the Smithsonian site evaluation process. Next slide. We are currently conducting the following steps: We're reaching out to leadership of agencies with jurisdictions over the sites to discuss acquisition potential for each. We're analyzing a smaller group of focus sites in greater depth, which I'll describe later in this presentation. We're refining the planning level programs for use and massing studies and cost studies to inform site evaluations. In other words, going into further detail of the analysis of these focus sites. We're developing more detailed costs estimate for each of the sites, and we plan to return to NCPC in September to share our massing studies, cost analysis,'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'and responses to your feedback today. And based on this fully developed evaluation, we would anticipate receiving former written comments and, on the site selection from NCPC, as well as many others named in enabling legislation, prior to our submittal of the final site recommendations to the Smithsonian Regents in October. Next slide. This map illustrates where we started our evaluation process for the long list of sites drawn from the study by the two Commissions that developed the Presidential Congressional Commission reports that preceded the enabling legislation. Earlier in the process, we added two sites located beyond the map for consideration, Walter Reed and Barry Farms, and as Mr. Flis mentioned, since we last met with this group we had an additional site, a Tidal Basin site which was brought to our attention by a member of the public. I would like to now introduce Luanne Greene, president of'",

        "'MS. GREENE': 'Great. Thanks, Ron. We can go ahead to the next slide. There are six high-level criteria that we're using to help us understand each of the sites. Each of the high-level criteria also has defined sub-criteria, and the sub-criteria are weighted to reflect (Audio interference.) critical, important, or desirable characteristics. Next slide. As an example, here are the sub- criteria for the location. They are: -Proximity to the National Mall. Is this site on, near or off-Mall; -Prominence of site location - how visible is the site? -Significance to constituent groups; -Visitation potential and proximity to the other Smithsonian museums and other active areas on the Mall; - Preservation of key views and site lines, of course. Next slide. As the sites are analyzed against the criteria, the results are summarized. This is an example of an early summary for the Arts and Industries Building, one of the four. This'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'is a living document. It's updated to reflect ongoing input from stakeholders. Our tours were amazing, the survey work, all of the work we're doing, as well as further analysis of the sites. Next slide. So we have gathered quite a bit of data on many sites. That analysis is instrumental in identifying the Tier 1 sites that Ron mentioned earlier. So, Ron, I'll turn it back to you to pick up from there.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'Thank you so much, Luanne, for that overview. Next slide. These sites include three of the four sites named in the enabling legislation. The Smithsonian Arts and Industry Building, the Northwest Capital site, the Southwest Monument site, opposite of the National Museum of African- American History and Culture Museum, plus the additional site at the tidal basin. One thing was clear in hearing feedback from our stakeholders and the surveys that was of interest to both of the museums to be located on the Mall, which was definitely one of our influential factors in us developing these focus sites. And to be clear, we did not eliminate any sites. We're just continuing to focus our efforts in a greater detail in the remaining sites that are left. So it's more of a focused analysis, in which we described earlier, which we're going to be continuing doing massing studies, cost studies,'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'and additional analysis of these sites. Next slide. The Arts and Industry Building is one of the first of the focus sites, and is the only site under the Smithsonian's jurisdiction, and is one we're looking very closely at its capacity to house the main museum. It has enormous advantages in its central location, and is one of Washington DC's most distinctive historic buildings, whose exterior restoration was completed within the past ten years. It's also on the National Mall. It was listed in the enabling legislation for the National Museum of the American Latino. Its unique historical character also brings several opportunities for development. Next slide. The Northwest Capitol is also one of the second of our focus sites. The Northwest Capitol is in the enabling legislation for both of the museums as part of the US Capitol grounds under the jurisdiction of the Architect of the Capitol. We'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'are looking more closely at this site's capacity to accommodate the new museum. Although on the edge of the Mall's public museum campus the site along Pennsylvania Avenue as well as being on the Mall, is prominent, and the site could accommodate a museum at its east end. Like other sites on the Mall, this site has challenges, including its location in a flood plain, and the Capitol's need for physical security measures. Next slide. The third of our four focus sites is the South Monument site, which enjoys a prominent location near the Washington Monument, and across the Mall from the National Museum of the African- American History and Culture. It was identified as a site for consideration for enabling legislation for both museums. The site is on the National Mall. Although it is in the Reserve, the no-build zone includes the central parts of the Mall, formed by'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'its major cross-axes. The site is one of the smaller sites under consideration, and we understand it must conform to the McMillan Commission set-back line. Next slide. The fourth of our focus sites is the Tidal Basin site, which enjoys a similar prominent location of proximity to the Washington Monument and to the west of the Holocaust Museum. It is in the Reserve. Our analysis has suggested building in the vicinity of the current rugby field to avoid the flood plain and the more sensitive cherry tree landscapes to the south. Next slide. Those were the four focus sites that we're continuing to develop our analysis, and I'll quickly just describe the survey. Since we last met with you, we completed the national survey to help us refine our site selection criteria and its weighting. We also wanted to get further outreach and input into the process. Those who were'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'surveyed included panels composed of those to reflect the national demographics. That was one poll that we surveyed. We also did an outreach variety group, which was mainly stakeholders in the current National Museum of the American Latino efforts, and the Smithsonian American History Museum efforts as well, so a more focused group with them. Not much difference in the responses between those interested in the Women's History Museum, the American Latino Museum, although there was a difference in that the American Latino respondents had more affinity for festivals and performances, bilingual signs, parks, and youth and family-friendly space outside of the museum. Next slide. One last thing I was going to point out -- Go back to the previous slide, I'm sorry. I skipped one. One thing is that we did ask in the questions how receptive they were to either a new building or a renovated building. Many'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'of the respondents were open to having a renovated building, but needed to have more information before committing, which we thought was positive for feedback for some of our thoughts regarding the AIB building. Next slide. As far as the next steps, of course, we're very pleased to be here today. We have a busy summer ahead of us, with getting feedback and getting our final analysis drafted. Next slide. We will plan to be back, as mentioned earlier, to the NCPC in September, prior to our final briefing. In the next few months, we will continue our discussions with site owners to understand their concerns and address their feedback. We'll be addressing feedback from external stakeholders, including outreach to solicit comments from agencies and individuals identified at the legislation. We will further develop our architectural programs, site evaluation, the asking studies, cost studies, and distance studies. And finally, as'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'I mentioned, we'll return to NCPC in September. Next slide. That concludes our presentation for today. We are very happy to take questions. I'm now going to turn it over to Ann Trowbridge, and other Smithsonian Institution who are here to assist any questions or comments that you may have. Thank you very much.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' Thank you, Ron, and if there's any doubt who should answer a question, I will direct it to a member of our team.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Flis, Undersecretary Cortez, Director Zamanillo, Director Sasaki, Ms. Greene, and Ms. Trowbridge. We really appreciate all of you being here with us today, and hanging in there with us to this hour. Do any of the commissioners have questions? I see that Commissioner May has raised his hand, so Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' My question's pretty basic, and you note this in the presentation that two of the sites are located within the Reserve, and the language of the authorization per the museums states pretty clearly that the museums shall not be located within the Reserve. So is there, are you planning some sort of congressional strategy, because it seems difficult to get from where you are right now to a selection by the end of December, as required under the authorization. I'm just curious what your plans are with regard to that kind of outreach.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'I think that's a very good question. I think our first approach was to, in terms of the feedback that we received from the stakeholders, which is they were definitely interested in being on the Mall themselves. And so we clearly looked at those that were going to take their site that were located on the Mall. We also looked at which sites were occupied and which were vacant, and we're continuing to develop our analysis now in regard. We clearly understand that enabling legislation for the museums asked us to look at the South Monument site, which is both, which is actually in the Reserve. So a little bit of conflict there, and we believe that going through this process will help us develop and be able to convey what those complexities are to others as we move forward. So I think this is, I appreciate the comments, really'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'part of the process as we believe in going forward.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I didn't hear you mention the word Congress in there, so at this moment you are just building up towards something that may eventually involve going to Congress? Because it does say, shall give consideration to the South Monument site, which is, giving consideration is not very specific. But, shall not be located on the Reserve is. So it seems pretty clear that there'd have to be some sort of legislation, and certainly that would be the case for the Tidal Basin site, which is not one that was to be given consideration. I don't mean to press the point. I was just hoping to learn a little bit more about your broader strategy in that regard.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Yeah. I think the way I would answer that is that this is a transparent process, in that we haven't really jumped to that part yet. We are in the evaluation analysis phase, and the next part of this is, I mentioned earlier, outreach into the different agencies who oversee these particular pieces of property and have that discussion with them. So that's the phase we're sort of in now. I know we did have the initial alerting of the agencies that we were considering, but not really a discussion, and really, now is the time for the discussion. But we felt that having this information available to them would kind of, some people talked about we need that massing studies, which we are nearly complete in doing. Then we can have a better discussion. That's sort of the part that we're in right now.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Okay. I mean, it's still, I think you're in a bit of a pickle given the timing of what's required for the selection, but we don't need to go into the details of that. (Simul taneous speaking.)'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Yeah. I appreciate that. We'll note that as I convey this information back. Thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I know that you've had some conversations already with our Secretary, and of course I'm representing the Department of Interior here, not really the Park Service, but I know you've had contact with the Secretary and the Secretary's office, and we have been discussing this and discussing with our lawyers as well. Happy to start having those more concrete conversations as soon as you are ready.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' I appreciate that outreach, and we'll be reaching out too, very shortly, because we pretty much have all the information I think will provide a good discussion. That's all part of the process, so we appreciate that.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Great. Okay. Thank you. I will have comments when we get to that stage, but for now that's it for my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' All right. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Any other questions for the team? Commissioner Cash.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' One quick question. Does the legislation specify whether it has to be in a space that is owned by the Smithsonian, or can it be a long term, 100-year lease or something like that, of an existing building?'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Let's have, Ann, can you answer that?'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' Yes. Commissioner Cash, the legislation does specify that if an agency agrees to transfer its site, they will send a letter to seven congressional committee leadership members of the House and Senate, saying that they're willing to transfer. And to me, transfer means transferring jurisdiction, rather than leasing.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Okay.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' However, if a situation arose through these conversations that Ron is talking about, I am sure there could be some other agreement with another federal agency that we could consider and they could consider, and go back to Congress about.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' And what's the current relationship, or, I guess, who owns the Postal Museum? Is that actually the Postal Service, and you all have that kind of an arrangement, or do you own half of the building?'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' We have an agreement. It's not exactly a lease, because I'm not sure we pay much rent, if any, but we have an agreement with the Postal Service, and I think there's some others involved in the ownership of that building.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Okay. I'll have a couple of other comments, but I just wanted to tee it up with those questions, so thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Anyone else with questions for the team?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes, I have a question.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' All right.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' This is not an easy one to answer, but I still want to know. How much of a role did resistance play in your decision matrix?'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Resistance in the terms of sustainability and recovery from --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' No, no, political resistance.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Oh, political resistance.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes. I mean, so each site has a constituency, and I just wanted to know how much that was considered.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' I would say that it's really the other way, in the fact that we really heard strongly that people want to be located on the Mall itself. And then we have this matrix of different factors that's been developed by Ayers Saint Gross, and that's how we push this forward, with the weighting of location being stronger than some of the others.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I ask because it's shaping up like a spreadsheet exercise, and I'm not sure that that's the most reflective of reality. And I'll just leave that right there. I think there's some, that the matrix all makes sense. I asked some questions as we were going along. For example, how much attention would be paid to recent investment in certain properties that the federal government has made. I'm a little concerned that some of these sort of soft, subjective factors that are in the end very pragmatic, may not have been weighted as heavily as they should have been, and I'll leave it at that for right now. It's a worry.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Okay. Thank you. I'll reflect that.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Are there any other questions before we go to discussion? Hearing none, I will now open it up to the commission for discussion. If everyone would please turn on your cameras, I will start with Commissioner Cozart, and then go in round robin format, using our normal seating order. Please keep your webcams on, and let's begin with Commissioner Cozart.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' I don't have any real comments, just appreciate the presentation and understanding what are some of the dynamics that you're trying to balance. I look forward to continued coordination with the District, as appropriate.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Did you mean to skip over Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' I did not. I have you out of order. Commissioner McMahon, I'm so sorry.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' We're all flexible here. Thanks for the presentation. I've got no questions or comments.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, sir. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yes, I do have a few comments. I will note for everyone's benefit that there will be a consultation with the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission on July 27. That's also pursuant to the authorizing legislation, that there be consultation with the chair, which is the role I play with that commission. I look forward to hearing that presentation, and I appreciate the fact that the Smithsonian is willing to present to the entire commission, because that's not really what was required. But I appreciate your having that full discussion, so we can take advantage of the insights of all the members of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission. And of course, we noted already further consultation that will happen with the Department of the Interior. I will note that, putting aside even the question of the Reserve, if any National Parks Service site is selected, because it would involve'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'a discretionary decision on the part of the Secretary, it will require compliance with NEPA, but I think this is something I mentioned the last time around as well. But it's just a reminder. That's another reason why the timing of this, again, no matter what site is selected, if it's a Park Service site outside the Reserve even, we would have that complication and the time that it takes. I am a little curious, I mean I appreciate the fact that what you are showing us are focus sites. Those are the few that are the most desirable because of their location on the Mall. And I'm encouraged to hear that you actually suggested that no site has truly been eliminated, because one of my suggestions would have been to make sure that you have some backup sites. Because if you are attempting to get something done before the'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'end of the year, that may be the only way you can do, would be to select some of these other sites, or one of these other sites. Of course it is possible that you could select the Arts and Industries Building and the Northwest Capitol site and then the Park Service and Reserve issues would go away. But I imagine you might have some challenges at the very least with the Northwest Capitol site, because I know that's been a site that's been coveted by many groups for many purposes over the years, and has been very difficult to get approved something going there. I would recommend, if you can do this, for the sake of your transparent process, that you actually begin to include what you think are the other short-listed alternatives. I know that you started out with a very large number. We were down to a'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'dozen or so last time around. I expect that some of those have fallen out for technical reasons. It might be worthwhile stating what the backup sites are, for the purposes of, again, transparency and keeping folks informed, because when the analysis came out that these are the focus sites, it sort of shocked quite a few people, including the people in my agency and my department. I would also say, I'm sure this point has been made to you already in other ways, but thinking about museums and the future of museums in Washington, I think it is very important to be thinking beyond the National Mall, because there is only so much real estate there. And in fact, at this point I don't think there is any real estate that is actually on the Mall that would be available for memorials other than the Arts and Industries Building'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'and maybe the Northwest Capitol site. Maybe you could go up a little bit further to the west and be thinking about, maybe there's a space along Independence or something like that, but thinking more broadly about where the future expansion of the Smithsonian complex will go. Will it go up 10th Street, or will you develop a parallel row on Independence Avenue or something like that? Those are the important things that you should be considering, because we already have one more museum that's gotten an authorization for further study, the Asian American and Pacific Islander Museum that will be evaluated. It may take ten years, like it has for the Museum of the American Latino to get to this stage. But in the scope of things which we do work, the Smithsonian is not a young institution, National Park Services is not a young institution, we think in'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'terms of forever, and I think you do too. So we think in that kind of a time scale, what does the future hold for these important cultural institutions? I think that that's the bigger picture, consideration that should be part of the thinking, and whether you actually will address it at this stage or not, I hope you are thinking in those terms. I just want to repeat, everyone wants to be on the Mall. We face that all the time with memorials, and generally speaking memorials are much smaller than the museums, but they can be substantial. The Congress gave us guidance in the Commemorative Works Act to keep new memorials out of the Reserve area, and to require a higher threshold for memorials that come close, within Area 1 as defined by the Act. I think that that sort of perspective should be embraced when it comes'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'to new museums. In fact, if you read the Commemorative Works Act carefully, it actually prohibits new museums within Area 1. Congress granted some flexibility here, but we have to be thinking in a longer view. All that being said, of course we're very supportive of the mission of both museums and want to see them properly sited. We are particularly interested in seeing some of the other sites brought back into the picture, if that's possible. I think that's it, folks. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Thank you. I don't know if I'm allowed to talk, but great feedback. I wrote that down, and I appreciate that.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Okay.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' I appreciate what I think for the Applicant, was a nice, thoughtful, and guiding comments that Commissioner May has just made. I will leave it at that. I don't have anything to add to that. He's in a position to give the applicant the kind of information that I think will be most useful to them as they pursue along this path. So I appreciate that, Commissioner May, and I really don't have anything to add. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Argo. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'I don't have much to add, other than I would, again, everyone here is familiar with the 2M plan. I would second Mr. May's comments. As a member of NCMAC we see this all the time. Everybody wants to be on the Mall, and so there has been a lot of work done to foresee the day that has arrived where real estate is no longer available. And I totally appreciate the position that the Smithsonian is in. Having two museums at once you could hardly give a Mall site for one without selecting a Mall site for the other, so it's a twofer proposition. I totally see that, because a firestorm would ensue if one made it to the Mall and the other didn't. So I get that. But I can't help but refer again to the work that's been done to imagine this moment, and here we are.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'I do urge that backup sites be disclosed, because I think I also can say that at least among the people with whom I discussed this revelation, that it was already down to four. We had thought it was at eight, and the press release was embargoed and it was leaked anyway. I assume that it was leaked by somebody who didn't like the selections. I appreciate the position that the Smithsonian is in, but I can imagine this final four being a list that's going to really be difficult to bring to fruition. So I would hope that if there is a process for revisiting, that perhaps we all keep an open mind.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' No comment. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'I know that it's late and I am the last one in line, but I just had to put some strong thoughts on the record. I worked in the Senate for ten years. The idea that there is a big chunk of green space adjacent to the Capitol is even under consideration for this is bananas to me, when the Senate has all these parking lots, there's one right there at North Capitol and E. You're going to get anything from the Senate or the Architect of the Capitol, look at those kind of sites. We have Union Station right now, which is hemorrhaging any sort of tenants, maybe there's some kind of partnership that could happen where we could get a museum space in there to clear out all these tenants and have a lot of traffic right next to another Smithsonian station. And we have all the new'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'stuff that will be coming on line over the next decade or so on the back side. Some of the other creative things that I think, Federal Triangle. I'm sitting right here on Federal Triangle right now, in the Wilson Building, and I can tell you, I think that with the pandemic and looking at how people are going to be teleworking, there could be other opportunities, maybe, within the FTC building or other places. Or maybe making some space available like we used to have in the Department of Commerce with the aquarium. I know the federal government is very stovepiped, and there's, I don't own this, you own that, but maybe just some more creative thinking about if we want to stay close to the Mall, look at Federal Triangle and pick up some more leased space. God knows the District has a lot of vacant office space'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'right now that I'm sure we'd be happy for the feds to be able to enter into some leases with us. I mean, it also struck me that Bureau of Engraving and Printing, another project that we've been looking at, because they're moving to Maryland. That's a building right next to the Mall. So I think my frustration when I saw this list, that none of these locations seemed like the best that we could do, given the conditions right now, and just all the other options if we could just be a little bit more creative. I mean, I worked for the feds for many years. I can only imagine what Commissioner Wright and others go through all the time, but you all have a lot of stuff downtown, really close to the Mall, and DC has a lot of stuff that we can offer that's further away from'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'the Mall, maybe more convenient to a Metro. So I would just echo Commissioner May in saying that if there is going to be congressional strategy, perhaps instead of going to Congress and asking if you can get on the reservation, maybe the best thing right now, in the next however many more months before the December deadline, go to Congress and maybe try and get a little bit of an extension. I really think that maybe we need to look at this with some fresh eyes and not being under the gun or under some of the political pressure that's causing some tension. I think if we rush this, it's possible that we'll get it wrong. I know the sponsors of this legislation on the Hill want these things to move, they want the site selected to move their projects forward. This is the National Mall and downtown DC,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'and I think that if we're going to rush something, we're more likely to get it wrong. I would just urge that if you all feel like you don't have enough good options or enough good time, go back to Congress and see if you can get another six months or another year so that we can get this right, and that we don't make a mistake that we can't correct on one of the most important pieces of real estate in the United States. Kind of a vent, kind of a suggestion, but thanks for listening, and sorry for going a few more minutes past six. But thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Commissioner Cash, and I'm glad you didn't feel inhibited by time. I think this is a really important conversation, and I appreciate all the commissioners being so passionate and thoughtful about how they view the site selection process, not just for these two museums, but for what comes next. I want to thank the Smithsonian for being here and for this briefing. It is really exciting to have these two new museums underway, and hearing today that President Biden has signed legislation for yet a third new museum. As I mentioned in the previous information presentation, the American story on the Mall was incomplete. That's another way to look at this. And both of these new museums reflect populations that are significantly underrepresented in the commemorative landscape. So we appreciate the advocates for these museums want to be on the Mall. We understand that motivation, and it sounds'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'like you're continuing to make progress narrowing in on the priorities for each of these museums, the significance and the desire to locate on the National Mall. The pressure must be enormous. But it does seem that while every site has its own complications, the Arts and Industries Building and the Northwest Capitol site could be viable contenders, and have the benefit of being outside of the Reserve yet still on the Mall. I was really intrigued by Commissioner Cash's suggestion about the parking lot. That's a very interesting question about what we could do to be creative. I'm also still intrigued by the Whitten Building, which has one of the most prominent locations on the Mall. I recognize it's a building used by Department of Agriculture is a complication, a big complication, but I do encourage further exploration of that site, just given its prominent location. Again, more museums,'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'I am sure, will be coming your way as you consider these sites, and we'll reach a point where I think as has been said repeatedly, there simply won't be any sites left on the National Mall, that we'll get the L'Enfant Promenade and Independence Avenue extension to the Mall. And of course the Department of Energy sites across the street from the Smithsonian and Capitol could be very symbolic. But in terms of next steps, I will work with our staff diligently to summarize the commission's comments here today, and send these comments to the Smithsonian for further consideration, as part of our process. Again, I ask everyone to think about representation. I think that's a very important consideration that the Smithsonian is working hard to address. So with that, I'm going to ask Diane Sullivan to give a quick overview of what we've heard today, and once Ms.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Sullivan is finished, if the commissioners would raise your hand and indicate if you think we've missed something in the summary. I'm going to put you on the spot, Ms. Sullivan, so thank you very much.'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': 'Thank you, Chair White, and actually you did a pretty nice job on summarizing a lot of the comments that we've heard, so it's just to suggest that I think we'll organize our comments around three ideas. One is, it's early in the process, and there's not a lot of planning analysis yet, of these sites that we've seen. So we'll have more to say to the Commission, I think, in September. I know that we're asking for the analysis early, so that staff and the commissioners can have time to digest this, so hopefully that will be with us in early August. The overarching comment today is that people were encouraged to hear that the other Tier 1 sites have not been eliminated, and there's strong encouragement to keep those on the table if some of the four focus areas sites don't work out, but also that there are'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': 'going to be more museums in the future as we have done with numerous in the past. We've worked with GSA and other stakeholder agencies and there are wonderful places to go off of the National Mall but right nearby, on the Promenade and Independence Avenue. Commissioner Cash mentioned a bunch of ideas which we will capture, but we have to think more creatively because we are going to be out of space at some point in the near future. There are huge opportunities could be thought of very well as extensions of the National Mall. They are so close, and could be very powerful sites. We'll go through the commissioners' comments and make sure that we capture everything that was said to that main point. And then I think lastly, Commissioner May's remarks is that there's still a lot of discussions that have to happen between the plans from'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': 'the agencies and the Smithsonian. It sounds like that's going to be starting in the very near future. I think I will leave it at that, but anybody wants to add anything, But I did take copious notes here, so we'll make sure we capture just about everything that was said.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Ms. Sullivan. Do any of the commissioners have comments?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I would ask that you specifically include Banneker, the Banneker Overlook site. We spent an awful lot of time on the 10th Street plan to not mention them specifically.'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' Will do.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. If there are no further comments or questions, a big thank you to Ms. Sullivan and to our Smithsonian colleagues --'",
        "'MS. SCHUYLER': ' Madame Chair, I'm sorry, this is General Counsel. Mr. Cortez has his hand up.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Oh, I'm sorry. It's hard to keep all the faces and hands. I'm sorry, Mr. Cortez. Please.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Thank you very much. I just wanted to provide a slight bit of clarification in the fact that I did mention that we have not eliminated sites. We have focus sites, so we do feel strongly about these four focus sites.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. That's an important clarification. We appreciate that.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' And now I have everyone's face on the screen. Does anyone else have any comments or questions before we conclude the meeting? Again, I just want to extend our thanks for the presentation today, and the very candid dialog and the transparency in your answers. It's very much appreciated.
