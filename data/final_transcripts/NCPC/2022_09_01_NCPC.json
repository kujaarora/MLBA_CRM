The National Park Service, on behalf of the Peace Corp Commemorative Foundation has submitted preliminary site development plans for the Peace Corp commemorative work for Commission review. The Commission last reviewed this project in May 2019 when it provided comments on the concept for the commemorative work. Since that review, the Applicant has responded to the Commission's comments and made significant changes to the design of the work. The Applicant will return to the Commission for a final review at a future date. As a reminder, the proposed site for the future commemorative work sits along Louisiana Avenue in northwest Washington, D.C. in Reservation 727. The parcel sits adjacent to several important sites in Washington including the U.S. Capitol Building and grounds, the National Mall, and Pennsylvania Avenue. Excuse me. Louisiana Avenue also links the National Mall with Union Station, making it'",

Here is a closer view of the triangular park comprising Reservation 727 and its setting in downtown. This image shows current conditions from the east side of the site. And this is a view of the site from the west. At preliminary review, the Commission evaluates the Applicant's approach to the proposed site improvements, landscape approach, impacts to key views, and how the project has responded to previous Commission comments. Under the Commemorative Works Act, both NCPC and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts have review and approval responsibilities. Since the concept review, the Applicant has revised the project design and eliminated the proposed glass and metal pergola shown in this nighttime rendering from the previous review. We thank the Applicant for removing the pergola element from the design as it would have enclosed the park on'",

The preliminary design for the commemorative work intends to be symbolically interpretive of the mission of the Peace Corps. Major site elements that comprise the overall composition include an elliptical world map plaza and benches in granite with sculptural carved hands. Since the concept review, the Applicant has also addressed previous issues with retention of trees and appropriate tree replacement. Several design elements from the concept review have been retained for preliminary, including a representation of the world located within the plaza area with an offset north orientation. The map will be in contrasting tones of granite representing land mass and water. And here is a slide showing the proposed map material finishes. The landscape approach seeks to complement the landscape of the U.S. Capitol grounds. The landscape palette includes canopy planting and flowering understory'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'trees and ground cover. Since the concept review in 2019, the Applicant has also worked with staff to clarify that of eight of the existing trees on the site, five trees will remain, while three were determined to be in poor condition but will be replaced with new trees. The new trees will be planted, including canopy trees such as red oaks, American elms, and black gums. Understory flowering trees include dogwoods and sweetbay magnolias. All the proposed new trees are native trees found in the mixed mesophytic forests of the Mid-Atlantic states. Therefore, staff recommends that the Commission find the Applicant has addressed the Commission's concern of retention of healthy trees and adequate tree replacement. The Applicant has included coneflower as part of the planting palette, which is a pollinator species.

At their tallest, the benches measure three feet, seven inches, with a seating component of the benches measuring one foot, six inches from the ground. Each of the three hands will have a different position, and each bench will have inscriptions on the interior and the exterior sides reflecting the mission of the Peace Corps and their work around the world. Staff appreciates all the design modifications that have occurred since concept review. Each has improved the park and the commemorative experience.

The Applicant is continuing to work on how to appropriately light the park in a way that is complementary with its setting and will provide the details at the time of the Commission's final review. Given these changes, staff finds that the Applicant has revised the design for the commemorative park in response to the Commission's comments at concept including removing the glass and metal pergola element that had the potential to obstruct critical views and impede pedestrian access into the park.

It will be at once retrospective and prospective. It's directly meaningful in perpetuity even if the Peace Corps no longer exists two centuries or three centuries from now. Sculptor Larry Kirkland and Michael Vergason Landscape Architects have proposed an artful concept symbolically embodying and conveying the key meanings and messages of this commemorative. The three granite bench hand sculptures will encircle the world map on a plaza centered within a newly landscaped public park. And I would add this is a projection of the world that does not show -- purposely avoids showing geo-political boundaries. It's about breaking down barriers. For the three hands, Larry Kirkland used digital renderings'",

Based on Larry Kirkland's artistic explorations, the design team and the Peace Corp Commemorative Foundation Board concluded that figural realistic hands would most clearly represent and express generosity and outreach, giving and receiving, teaching, and learning as has been mentioned. I would conclude by just saying, we are very confident, the design team and the board of the Commemorative Foundation, we are very confident that this park and artwork always will be inspiringly interpretive and well-understood thanks, in part, to the timeless form and beauty of these realistically shaped human hands. And I'll be happy to answer questions.'",

        "'MR. BERNE': 'Thank you. Please recommend that the National Park Service add common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, and swamp milkweed, Asclepias incarnata, to this phlox landscape plan and the planted plant palette. The planting palettes states, \"Flowering plants would be interspersed between the groundcover and bioretention area plantings.\" The page shows that interplanted species will be coneflower and daffodil. The planting palette will contain prairie dropseed and iris, blue flag, in its stormwater management bioretention area. The palette will contain common rush as a ground cover in its ground plane. It is therefore important for you to recognize that two of these plants, prairie dropseed and common rush do not adequately support pollinators. Prairie dropseed is a wind-pollinated grass. Common rush is a grass-like perennial that is typically pollinated by wind. Monarch butterfly populations are declining throughout the United States. To help reverse this decline, President Obama issued in 2014 a memorandum entitled'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honeybees and Other Pollinators. The memorandum noted that there was an immediate risk for failed monarch butterfly population on migration because of its decline. To implement the federal strategy, the memorandum created a pollinator task force, which in 2015 issued a national strategy to promote the health of honeybees and other pollinators. This strategy laid out federal action intended specifically to increase pollinators and monarch butterflies as well as honeybees and other pollinators. Monarch caterpillars feed only on milkweed. To help restore monarch populations and to comply with the task force's national strategy, the National Park Service needs to include appropriate species of milkweed in every single landscape plan that will contain plantings of groundcovers or perennials. Common milkweed is the only milkweed species that thrives in natural areas in the Washington, DC, area, and that monarchs prefer when laying eggs.'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'The Smithsonian Pollinator Garden -- museum -- pollinator garden contains much common milkweed. Common milkweed is, therefore, suitable for planting within this park as a ground cover and as an interplanted species. Monarchs also prefer swamp milkweed in laying eggs. This milkweed flies in the marshes of wet areas. This plant is, therefore, suitable for planting in the park's fire retention area because it will absorb stormwater that drains into the area. To comply with President Obama's memorandum and the task force's national strategy, the Park Service needs to -- and this is important -- plant common milkweed as a replacement for common rush and ground cover in the ground plane, and, as an addition, in the interplanted species. Plant swamp milkweed as a replacement for prairie dropseed in the bioretention area. Therefore, the two species, wherever you put them, swamp milkweed and common milkweed, really need to be in'",

The planting plan is really -- has not been completed. It's still in a stage of development. The thing that we need to consider is that as the trees that we are recommending to be planted in this park grow and mature, they will begin to shade this park quite completely. The milkweed species, both the dry species and the wetland species, are full-sun meadow-type plants, and as the shade of the park increases, the ability of the milkweed to sustain itself will decline. So we definitely agree that additional pollinators need to be considered, and we will probably look at what we can specify that will be more shade tolerant as these species of trees that we are recommending begin to mature.

But I don't -- the benches just don't -- I just don't think, conceptually, it works. And aesthetically, the hands are done a disservice by being, you know, the termination of these benches. And I would refer you to works like, you know, everybody knows the Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel. Less well-known, but even more beautiful is the Hand of God by Rodin.

And while they're beautiful sculptures, attached to these benches the forms are -- they may enclose the space and do those things, and they respond to the -- they shape the space. They do their job with the map. It's the combination of the way the -- as objects how they interact with one another. I can't get there with you. The rest of it is, I think, beautiful.

I'm struck -- when I looked at the kind of context map, I was struck by the U.S. Capitol and by its proximity to Union Station and then moving on farther to the Mall. And I think it's going to be a wonderful respite for folks who are moving in between those places and a great opportunity to take pictures and that kind of thing -- If you're thinking about eighth -- middle schoolers, visiting D.C. for the first time -- and that made me think perhaps the abstraction could have a little bit of whimsy to it to'",

        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' You may. You may, Mr. May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So, you know, I certainly would be happy to check -- you know, bring Roger Lewis back into the conversation, but I think -- because he might be able to answer more specifically about the extent to which the design team has considered this. But I can say, I think with very high certainty, that the design team understands that this is not -- you know, this is not some sort of permanent fixture that's just going to sit there and nobody's going to touch it, and nobody's going to climb over it and things like that. And, in fact, I think that if the memorial sponsors, you know, walked into that park, and found children climbing on the hands, I think they would actually applaud that actually.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Yeah, exactly. Right. Right.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So I think it's a question of designing it to make sure that it is durable in that kind of a circumstance.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Exactly.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Because we certainly are not going to stop people from climbing on it, anyway, any more than you can stop people from climbing onto Einstein's lap, right.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Right.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So I see Roger Lewis on the screen. Can we give him a minute just to talk to this?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Sure. Mr. Lewis, please.'",
        "'MR. LEWIS': ' Thank you. Thank you. I just want to go back to making the point that we considered all of these issues many times over the past three years as Peter --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Excuse me. Excuse me. Mr. Lewis, can you just confine the comments to the most recent question about the hands?'",
        "'MR. LEWIS': ' That's what I'm getting at.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I mean about the climbing on the hands.'",
        "'MR. LEWIS': ' Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I think that we anticipate this will happen that they will accommodate people sitting -- and not only on the bench but, particularly, kids sitting on the hands.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I think that's really all I was looking for from Mr. Lewis.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Madame Chair?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I don't know, Madam Chair, if you want to hear more.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. I think I heard Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'Yes. I think that the image of the hands is really reaching out and touching, you know, reaching out to others. So I think that that symbolism is -- the sitting is fine. And like you said, those kids are going to sit in it and climb on it no matter what, but I think that it is the reaching out and touching that it symbolizes. I also would want to point out that, back in the 70s -- here I go with history again -- I had the option to help build a software package to take care of all these historical sites all around the world, and it was very exciting, and it was always about reaching out and getting new contractors involved and people locally involved and so forth. So I think it's the reaching out and the touching that those hands symbolize to me also. So'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'that's all I have to say.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. If there's no further comments or questions from the Commission, I'd like to offer my perspective that, overall, I'm very supportive of the changes that have been made. I find the revised design to be a big improvement. I'm very appreciative for that. It's much simpler, and I like the landscape improvements. And I really appreciate, Mr. Hayes, your willingness to explore further the recommendations from Mr. Berne around milkweed and your understanding of what will actually grow in the site and thrive, so I'm appreciative of your thoughtfulness there. As for the hands, I certainly support the idea of the symbolism of the hands and their connection to the Peace Corps. And as Commissioner Dixon noted, they reach out and touch people, and it's about connecting and embracing the world. But I do have to say I'm still struggling a bit with the lifelike depiction,'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'so I think I want to associate with Commissioner Wright and Commissioner Cozart. But I also -- I have to say, from a planning perspective, I do think we have to think about how someone would experience a public space and how it would make them feel. And I just want to share from my own personal perspective that the other thing that makes me a little uncomfortable is the idea of three hands instead two hands, and they're not -- they look -- I'm trying to say this in a polite way, but they look severed to me, and I find it a little bit disturbing, but again, they're beautiful. They're incredibly sculpted. So I would just ask you to think about those aspects whether either a more abstract depiction or why three instead of two, and you know, again, just keep thinking about this. I encourage you to,'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'you know, keep looking at this. I know there's been a great deal of thought and energy that's gone into this memorial. It's a very important international memorial, so please know we would really appreciate your taking the time to consider our further comments on this. And I really appreciate you being here with us today, Mr. Lewis, and the work you've done. So are there any other further comments or questions about this proposal?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Yes, I want to be -- clarify what I am talking about. It's not about -- I think the iconic -- the iconography, the meaning, is clear. What my point is -- and the sculptures -- as sculptures these hands are gorgeous, but it's their disposition. I agree with you. That's why I used the word -- and I thought about it because I don't -- I want to be very clear. This is not an indictment of the artist at all because the hands are gorgeous. But the cadaverous -- if that's a word -- quality is a combination of the disposition of the hand -- yes, the arm is reaching out, but if you really look at the energy that the hand articulates, it feels quite passive in its disposition. That's number one. The color of the marble, again, evokes this cadaverous quality that -- I think you'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'nailed it, Chairman White. When you combine those things with the fact that they're severed to make it a bench, the effect is -- and then because it's so realistically portrayed, the combination of effects is jarring and uncomfortable. When the message is supposed to be about reaching out in an active, assertive gesture of goodwill, it doesn't communicate that in its current form. So that's all. It's a very particular combination.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Thank you very much, Commissioner Wright for further clarifying that and helping --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Madam Chair.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' -- me explain what I was trying to convey. Yes, Commissioner Dixon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I would add that maybe you need more hands. And maybe you need to have the hands with tones so that you reflect that it's not just a person or a body's hands, one left and right, but multiple hands that are in this process, brown hands, gray hands, or whatever, black hands. I don't know if you can get the stones -- get a little carried away. I think you get my point. This is a very multi, ethnic multi outreach effort, and I think we know that, so anyhow, so I think maybe, you know, that's just another thought about the hands.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. I so appreciate about this Commission and the thoughtfulness and the different ways to approach public space. So thank you all for the comments. Are there any other comments or questions that folks want to make about this project?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I so move.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Hearing none, I take it that Commissioner Dixon has made a motion to approve the preliminary site development plans for Peace Corps Commemorative Park. Is there a second to that motion?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Second.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May has seconded. Ms. Koster, can you please confirm the motion and the second and take the vote by roll call?'",

        "'MS. KOSTER': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'Thank you, Chair White. So good afternoon, again, Commissioners. The National Archives and Records Administration has submitted concept plans for temporary landscape barriers for their National Archives building located between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues. As this is a concept review, the focus of today's presentation is to receive Commission comments and feedback prior to the Applicant preparing a more detailed submission. In this case, the focus of the review is understanding the appropriateness of the project for the site in context and understanding any particularly unique or complex issues that need to be addressed. The National Archives Building is located between Pennsylvania Avenue and Constitution Avenue with 9th Street and 7th Street -- 9th Street to the west and 7th Street to the east. You can see it's just north of the National Mall and the National Gallery Sculpture Garden and just south of the Naval Memorial. The scope of'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'the work encompasses temporary landscape barriers added along portions of 7th and 9th Streets and Constitution Avenue to protect queuing pedestrian to the building's two entrances at Constitution Avenue. NARA is already preparing initial concepts for a permanent perimeter security strategy, which they anticipate will be in place and functioning in time for the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 2026. The National Archives Building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and is a contributing element to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site. Therefore, any potential adverse effects related to a permanent security strategy for the building, as well as identified or potential historically significant elements, such as the setting and landscape, will be evaluated during the Section 106 consultation process. During this evaluation, the consulting parties will consider the different approaches for the permanent security and'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'any potential impacts to significant elements, which may result in tradeoffs as the project evolves. Here are some photographs showing the existing conditions along the main entrances and to the building along Constitution Avenue. And here are some additional existing condition photographs. Here is the existing site plan along Constitution Avenue. Currently, the front of the building does not have any security or safety barriers. The two visitor entrances are here, outlined in red. And in developing the proposed temporary safety approach, the Applicant met with the review agencies to seek an approach that would provide the desired safety for pedestrians and visitors to the building queuing along Constitution Avenue while minimizing the impact to the setting and public space. In addition, all of the proposed safety elements can be removed with minimal impact to the existing treescape. However, staff finds that the setting and the prominence of the National'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'Archives Building requires a restrained, context-sensitive approach to any permanent perimeter security elements. As I mentioned, the Applicant is seeking approval for these temporary barriers to provide safety to their visitors since there have been incidences where buses and cars have left the roadway and entered the sidewalk areas along Constitution Avenue as shown in these images. And as this photo shows, the lines of visitors queuing for the entrances into the National Archives building often stretch along the sidewalks fronting Constitution Avenue and turning onto 9th and 7th Streets. All of the proposed work will occur in NARA's property as indicated in the site plans provided in the submission and confirmed with the District Department of Transportation's right-of-way team. Thus, no public space permits are required for this project. The temporary safety barriers consist of two types, 43 rectangular concrete planters, and 29 rounded bollards. The rectangular concrete barriers'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'are 49 inches long, 24 inches wide, and 30 inches tall. The bollards will have a 24-inch diameter and will also be 30 inches tall. The concrete planters will not be anchored to the ground, while the round bollards will require drilling into the pavement to place but will not require any excavation. The holes drilled in the pavement can be easily filled and patched when the bollards are removed. Typical spacing of the barriers is four feet in separation and the special consideration for spacing has been incorporated in areas of high pedestrian traffic such as at the corners of 7th and 9th Streets. However, as NARA develops a permanent security strategy, concepts should include approaches within the building yard, even should the temporary safety approach receive approval from the Commission. As staff noted earlier, the Applicant intends to have a permanent perimeter security strategy in place by 2026.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'NARA anticipates re-engaging with the review agencies in early coordination in the next few months. The location of temporary safety measures may not be appropriate for the permanent security elements, and additional information about security needs will be required as part of the Commission's review of the final elements. As the proposed safety barriers are interim in nature, and as the Applicant has stated, they are actively working on a permanent solution, staff requests that the Applicant return to the Commission with an update on the permanent perimeter security design approach when applying for final review of the temporary safety measures. In closing, staff requests that the Applicant work with NCPC, the Commission of Fine Arts, District agencies, including the District State Historical Preservation Office, and the Section 106 consulting parties regarding the permanent design approach, which should include options and analysis of perimeter security placed within the building yard.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'This concludes my presentation, and as I've incorporated the recommendations into the presentation, I will not repeat them here. I am available to answer any questions as well as Mark Smith and John Bartell with NARA who are here also to respond to any questions the Commission may have. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Webb. Do Commissioners have any questions?'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' My question goes to the effort we made a number of years ago to develop this furniture that could be equally as secure but offer accommodations to tourists when they do visit these sites. Maybe that will be part of their final effort, but I just get concerned about resources spent for concrete blocks and barriers when we have a whole list of things that we know will offer protection but also give some accommodation to the tourists. And maybe that's not -- I don't know -- maybe not possible but just my thought. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Mr. Webb, would you want to address that question?'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Since we've just started talking with the Applicant about their permanent concepts, I think that should be included. I think from talking to them about the permanent strategy, they are open to going back and looking at different options. So Mr. Smith may be better to address that. And as he addresses the timeframe when they're going to reengage and looking at permanent security elements.'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'Yeah, so as Lee mentioned, thank you for your presentation. It was very well done. We have, actually, begun work on the permanent approach. I should mention that permanent solution did not arise from security concerns. It's actually part of a larger effort to increase and improve the visitor experience for the visitors to the Archives. And when we saw what that visitor experience team was looking at as you approach and enter the building, we recognized that also can be made to provide the security that we were looking for. So that is really the driver for the permanent solution. Those security aspects simply ride along as part of the process. I mean, we can certainly look at the usability of the site from a seating, landscape improvement effort as we do that. As to timing, we've got some revised concepts, we're ready to start staff discussions on probably'",
        "'MR. SMITH': 'in the next few weeks if we can arrange a schedule, otherwise early October.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Dixon, does that address your question?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Well, he does. I want to be sure it's clear that they did a whole lot of research. We did a lot of work on this at one point and developed examples of things that could be put in for security that had value and function and were also -- met the requirements to make the area secure. They were rigid enough, strong enough but provide that. Also, in terms of benches, seating, things that would not encourage homeless folk to sleep on them, even though we need to deal with that problem but not in this manner and other things. And just a table rather than a box, or just a -- anyhow, we had a bunch of things I thought we looked at, and maybe we can share those more widely so folks could think about them.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you very much because that was very important work. That establishes a great baseline for considerations, so thank you. Any other questions?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Madam Chair?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes, Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, I have a few questions. So we saw a photo of people queued on the sidewalk. Is that like the normal everyday condition, or is that just certain times of year? I mean, I know the art visitation ebbs and flows. What's the frequency of seeing that kind of lineup on the sidewalk?'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' Prior to the pandemic, that was a typical day.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' 365 days?'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' Well, 200 and some days, yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' 200 and some days, okay. And have you done some sort of analysis of what the numbers are and, you know, what the frequency is and things like that so when we get to the final, you'll be able to talk about that.'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' That's exactly what we've been looking at in this visitor experience. We're looking at not only providing queuing in a safe fashion and a more enjoyable fashion than standing on the sidewalk, but we're looking at ticketing kiosks and such to control the visitor flow to reduce the numbers, make it easier to access the museum.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Right, right. Yeah, it's not a great place to be standing out on the sidewalk, you know, in the middle of August waiting to get in.'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' No, sir. Not at all.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah. So I certainly appreciate that. I had a lot of experience working on the Capitol Visitor Center project, and we faced a lot of that same issues. It was partially about security, but it was also partially about the visitor experience and making it more tolerable for the people who would be waiting out there for like three hours in the hot sun.'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' Right.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So we saw a couple photographs of, I think, two incidents where vehicles jumped the curb there. And I'm wondering, first of all, what is the frequency of that sort of thing? And is there something about the nearby intersections or anything like that that's especially dangerous that needs to be addressed sort of off-site to make sure things like that don't happen?'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' That kind of traffic management issue I really cannot speak to. Our concern is not the unintentional traffic action, but the intentional act of someone who's not happy with the Archives and we have a lot of those people right now.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Right. Certainly, you do, and I'm very sensitive to that. So another thing I think will be necessary when it comes around for the final design is actually some sort of assessment of that. Certainly, that's the sort of thing that we had to go through for the Martin Luther King Memorial when we introduced security improvements there. That was part of the original establishment of the memorial, but we did go through a really extensive analysis of what the potential incidents could be. And I think one of the things that -- I mean, I'll make this point later -- but the concern is protecting people because they happen to be on the sidewalk is a tricky thing because there are so many places in Washington where people are on the sidewalk, and if you don't give them protection in one place, you know, should we be protecting them'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'everywhere, and I think that would be a little, a difficult thing. But I'll talk more about that later on. That's, I think, what's driving you. But having understanding of what the actual concern is, or the threat is, I think is really important. And I think, you know, some understanding of when there have been incidents of vehicles getting up if that actually is an issue with errant vehicles because that was certainly part of the thinking at Martin Luther King because of the positioning of the memorial at the intersection, so I think that's an issue. The only thing about it is, you know, a lot of times those things are addressed, not necessarily with continuous barriers, but with intermittent things that make it hard for a vehicle to get in. So I think they should be looking at that, too. I think that's it. That's it for'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' All right. Thank you. Other questions from Commissioners? Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, my question has to do -- I have a great deal of skepticism about the efficacy of these planters. Have they been tested to withstand up to certain speed of vehicular contact, and what's the speed?'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't have that information right at hand. They have been tested. They were specifically chosen for this purpose, but I couldn't give you the technical details.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'So, and what's inside the planters? The reason I'm asking is because GSA has some on the Federal Triangle along as you -- I'm sure you're very familiar -- along Pennsylvania Avenue. And I can't remember when this happened. Somebody else -- Peter, you might remember. There was a truck that came barreling down 13th Street and plowed into one of those planters and, basically -- okay, it was coming down that hill, and it -- I think it was a box truck. It was an accident. It wasn't a vehicular attack, but that doesn't really matter. What's germane to the question is that planter just slid, you know, a couple of dozen feet on impact, and so that's why I'm asking because they certainly give the impression that they could withstand a hefty impact, but in reality, they're not as strong as they look. That's why I'm asking about'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'the testing. Is there somebody who can speak to that because, I mean, I get that you want to do something temporary, but what's the point in doing something temporary if it doesn't work?'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' No, I don't think we have anybody online who can speak to the testing data for the planters, themselves. I know that we did review a number of different alternatives, and the ability of it to withstand vehicular impact was the reason the various ones we looked at were examined.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Maybe you can provide that and follow up with the staff, and we can get back to everyone before you come back?'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' Certainly.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' That would be very helpful.'",
        "'MR. SMITH': ' Certainly.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Any other questions, Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' No. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioners have questions? Okay. With that, why don't we go to discussion? If everyone would please turn on their cameras I will start with Commissioner Cozart and then go in a round-robin format using our normal seating order. So if you would please keep your webcams on during the discussion. And we will hear from Commissioner Cozart.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Just thank you for that presentation.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner McMahon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thanks for the presentation. You know, looking at it since this proposes a temporary solution, waiting for a more thoughtful permanent solution, I presume it's okay, but certainly coming back to the days of bollards and planters is not something we want to do. So I think we'll all look forward to a permanent solution that will be implemented in 20 '6 or '7. Thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'So I'd say that this is -- this proposal is troubling for me. NCPC has historically been reticent to allow for any kind of security improvements in the sidewalk space. And I mean, you know, this prompted me to go back to the -- what was it? I've forgotten the name now already. It's the Urban Design and Security Framework -- National Capital Urban Design and Security Plan, which includes language in it. Now, this is not an absolute, but it includes language that says that to the greatest extent possible, sidewalks should be left open and accessible to pedestrian movement and, generally, (audio interference) excluded, and so on. And I didn't, you know, the report seemed a bit lacking to me because it didn't really address that very directly. And I appreciate the fact that there is language in there now that -- or in the final report that'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'indicates that -- or that urges consideration of incorporating all the security improvements within the building yard, and that certainly is the right direction to go. Commissioner McMahon, thank you. I was hearing a lot of noise there for a second. You know, I note that there was -- it was pointed out that DDOT had not -- did not support this and believed that it had to go before the Public Space Committee -- their Public Space Committee, and I guess that's -- maybe that's not the case, but that's not really the bigger question. The bigger question is whether these things should be there. Certainly, the idea of creating a more comfortable atmosphere because it is kind of a bare sidewalk next to a lot of fast-moving cars, so the idea of including some street furniture that makes it actually a better space for pedestrians, I think, would'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'be a very positive thing. I don't really see evidence that that's what's going to happen out of this short-term effort, but it certainly is going to be, I think, part of the consideration when it comes to final. It's actually unfortunate that we don't really have a sense of what the final might look like and what's going to happen with that, but I think that the report urges that the Archives Administration look at that more thoroughly and, hopefully, that will come through when we actually look to the final. I think I alluded to this before. One of the concerns that comes up when we start to see planters and things at the curb, or closer to the curb, within the sidewalk, that it's driven by the concern that someone could deliberately drive down the sidewalk and injure or kill pedestrians. And certainly, that's a terrible thing,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'and we know that that has happened. But the vulnerability of the city overall is pretty broad. There are so many circumstances where there are a lot of people on sidewalks, including a lot of people on sidewalks who are waiting in lines. And I think the integration of street furniture that makes those sorts of things harder is a sensible approach, but I think that having bollard lines or security lines of, you know, that's made up of continuous elements out in the sidewalk or close to the curb is a difficult thing for us to try to approve because I think it sets a troubling precedent about how fortified we are going to try to make public Washington. It raises concerns for me. It raises concerns for me in my internal discussions. This is something that I have to deal with internally and with various partner agencies that'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'we work with, and I just think it's something we have to consider very carefully and try to look at. In a way, I think Mr. Smith tried to describe it that it should -- it came, I guess, from the visitor experience perspective and that it's about making the visitors feel comfortable as they wait in line to go into the Archives Building. I think that is the right approach, and I think that, but I think that we can -- you know, we don't want to go too far with the sort of the security from cars perspective. We need to be thinking about the visitor experience more holistically and thinking about things like benches and trees and so on and how they can make it into a more pedestrian-friendly environment rather than coming at it just from a, you know, a pure security perspective, which is just'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'like the easiest default setting for us. So, and again, you know, NCPC historically has stood on the right side of these sorts of issues and tried to navigate these things with the agencies that are seeking to take steps like this, and we have seen some pretty radical refinements to security designs as a result of those interactions. And since Commissioner Wright is on the screen there, I think particularly about what happened at Commerce and how that building's security improved from the earliest concepts, and the circumstances are different here, but I think that the ideas are the same. So I think that's about it. You know, I originally considered not voting to support this because of my concerns about the sidewalk, but I think that given the most recent considerations about what's happening in the world today, I'm okay with going forward with this at this time.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. I understand that sentiment. Commissioner Argo.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': 'Yes. Very helpful and thoughtful, Commissioner May. What was that I wrote down? How fortified do we want to make the visitor's experience? I think either Peter said that or somebody said that, but I think that is a question that, what I'm focused on right now is that question and how we maybe think about how we can provide some information to the Commission that staff could think about getting us, if staff -- I don't know whether we want a separate kind of presentation, but I think the whole issue of security, what options are out there, especially, you know, in the public space, how it affects visitor experience, how it affects the people's experience who live and work in Washington and all that is a big and significant overarching question that will continue to come up. And I'm trying to, what I'm not doing very well is'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': 'saying what I want to do about that is basically say I would like to get more information, broad information about what some of those questions are and what some of the different approaches are, as a member of the Commission, so I'm better educated. That's sort of what I wanted to say.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Argo. Perhaps we'll have a refresh and revisit the original standards and see if we need to update them in any way, so I think that's a really good question about how do we keep those fresh and keep looking at new solutions. So I appreciate that comment. Commissioner Wright.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Yes, I would save time by referring to Mr. May's remarks and adding just slightly to them. I also thought about voting against it, but, given what's happening with the poor, gosh, it's the archivists, man, they're just making all kinds of waves, and right now doing something -- I mean, I don't usually say this, but I think, in this case, something is better than nothing. I would like to know that the planters, what speed of a vehicular impact these planters are designed, the temporary ones, are designed to withstand. I think that's important to know, so I would urge the staff to find out because there is a threshold from which something isn't better than nothing. And it may be worth nervous visitors just feeling protected, and it may be worth a visual barrier that prevents or discourages somebody who is really mad at the archivists and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'a little nutty from doing something. So those things are not without value. But over the long haul, yes, they won't suffice. And then I would say, yes, thank you, Mr. May, I would refer you to the Department of Commerce and encourage you. That project, we got a concept approval, and then the design started going sideways and devolved into, it was something hard to pull off. We were thinking very hard about the visitor experience, but, in the case of the Department of Commerce, I want to say that 15th and 14th Street have something on the order of 1500 linear feet of sidewalk. And we were thinking about the employees, so we were thinking about people moving through a great length of space but they were moving or employees who needed a place to sit down and have lunch because food trucks tend to be on the'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': '15th Street side or used to be. So I would think about, yes the approach needs to be different because you're trying to accommodate a different visitor profile because they're standing still. But, yes, the emphasis should be on seating and their comfort while they wait for a long time in the hot sun. And, yes, trees, trees, trees because you can protect from vehicular attack, but also you need to think about just their comfort. And that informed our design. When we got halfway through, we realized we were going in the wrong direction and we started again. It looks like it ought to be easy, but to do it well, I think, requires really deep thinking and, yes, considering who you're designing for and what they're doing there and why are they there and what might they, what might make their experience more comfortable, more interesting, and more'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'protected, all those things, especially now. But, again, without the information, I'll leave it to staff to make the decision about whether something is better than nothing, but I hope that these things, you know, you're looking at at least, you know, a 30-mile-an-hour impact that they can withstand because there's also, like the slides you showed with the bus and the taxi, you know. There are people, you know, coming around that corner who aren't, who don't intend for it to be, there's no nefarious intent, there's just recklessness.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I think I'm next up. Am I heard?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes, please, Commissioner Dixon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'I would have to say a little less, but my experience with the staff in NCPC over the years has been when they dig into something they usually do pretty thorough work, very thorough work. And we did a lot of work on this furniture that we recommended. We did a whole report on it and a lot of research, so there's a foundation to start from. I don't think you can prepare for the ultimate because we don't know what people will throw in at you. But the kind of like things that we're talking about, the trucks, the cabs, things that are common vehicles, I think, you know, we've got to be able to protect for those. But we do need to look at this idea of providing accommodation, even if it's some kind of an artificial umbrella of some kind. I know we saw the ones at'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'HUD blew apart; that didn't work too well, but maybe we need more. And trees I think are very useful, too, as has been said. So I do think we've done a lot of work on this, I believe. Now, we need to go dig at it and go back and see if it has real value and get people more used to seeing furniture type stuff, useful stuff put down, rather than just go right to those, in quote, flowerpot trash cans that they put in that get loaded with trash and people even sleep in some of them, so that's not solving the problem, and it doesn't stop the vehicles either. So, anyhow, let's go back, bring all what we've got, and let's see if we need to redo it and encourage it, promote it. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you very much. Commissioner Ginsberg. Commissioner Ginsberg maybe had to step away. Well, I'll just add that I'm glad that the applicant has begun the process of analyzing these alternatives for the permanent security. You know, obviously, what you heard today, it's very important to us that we hear what this analysis is for alternatives so that we can really address this very critical question. So we typically seek solutions within the property's building yard to keep security elements out of the public realm, but I understand this is a historic building and any alternative will need to consider impacts to the building and the landscape. But we look forward to hearing back from you to hear more and how we want to address these very critical issues. And just to note, going back to an earlier comment from Commissioner May and taking a look at the broader context'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'of what is happening at this intersection that could be addressed perhaps by the Transportation Department, looking at traffic calming, bump-outs. I know that's a very controversial thing in many places, but I do think you have to look beyond just the area that you're responsible for and work to see if our traffic can be managed in a little bit different way so for those unintended or, as Commissioner Wright said, sort of reckless incidents versus intentional, I think those are really important to take a look at. So I appreciate that reminder, Commissioner May, that we have to look beyond the specific space that we're dealing with and understand that context around the traffic instance. Are there any other further comments or questions? I see Commissioner Wright's hand went up first and then Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Yes, thank you. I forgot something, too. Also keep in mind when you're looking at the permanent solution, this is one thing we learned when we started looking at a project at USDA, in a parking lot where there is a farmers' market, we started thinking about, well, if there is -- what you don't want to do is you need to design for the possibility of panic by the visitors because if there is an incident and the public is trying to scatter, you know, we were thinking of it in the old school kind of way at first, which was, well, we want to kind of soften the perimeter security as much as we can and make it invisible, and we had it designed to be masked by shrubbery and all of this. And then we realized, well, if there was a vehicular attack and a car did'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'penetrate the security and smashed into the parking lot, people would panic and be injured trying not escape and they would not be able to see the cable rail system that we had, bollards and rail. It's something to keep in mind that that's just another consideration, and that's not something that we were used to thinking about. In your case, if we were just thinking about protecting the building, we would say go into the building yard. There's no reason to be out in public space if you're just trying to protect a building. But your job is different here, and so, since you're trying to protect the unsuspecting and probably inattentive public who is sitting there waiting, queuing for tickets or to get inside, they're not going to be paying attention, but you have to make evacuation also something that's not hindered by whatever you put in.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Great point. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yes. I also wanted to mention the fact that, you know, what's happening with the street I think really is a critical consideration in that additional consultation with DDOT, particularly for the long-term solution, is very important. And I would note that Constitution Avenue is just such a total car-oriented highway kind of road and is very bicycle unfriendly, but the District is making moves all over the city to make this city more bicycle friendly and maybe there is something coming down the pike that will -- pardon the pun -- something in the future that could actually help improve the security circumstance here with those developments that are outside the property line. And the other thing I would mention is just that I happened to notice on one of the slides the consultant team that's on this, in particular Beyer Blinder Belle, was shown as participating in this.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'I don't know what their role is. All I can say is that they do very fine work and have worked on many street projects in Washington and come up with some very creative ways of dealing with that in different circumstances. So hopefully they will be involved in the permanent solution, and, if they are, I think that the National Archives and Records Administration will be well served by the insight that they can bring to it.'",

    "8. FORT BELVOIR NORTH AREA DISTRIBUTION CENTER ": [
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' The next item is to approve preliminary and final site and building plans for the Fort Belvoir North Area Distribution Center. And today we will be hearing from Ms. Free.'",
        "'MS. FREE': ' Yes. Can you hear me and see my screen?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes, thank you. Welcome.'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Chair White and Commissioners. The Department of the Army has submitted preliminary and final site and building plans for a new distribution center located at the Fort Belvoir North area located in Fairfax County, Virginia. You will recall reviewing concept plans for the distribution center in July and approving the final FBNA area development plan, or ADP, in March. The Commission noted general support for the proposal at the concept review stage, however deferred action on the perimeter security fence, the surface parking lots, and the entrance control facility. The Commission's preliminary and final review focuses on if the applicant addressed the comments and recommendations made during the concept review and if there are any outstanding issues. Overall, the Army has worked diligently with NCPC staff to address the Commission's previous comments, and staff recommends approval of the preliminary and final site and building'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'plans. In the following slides, I'll provide a brief overview of the existing site and an analysis of the updates made following the concept review. As a reminder, the FBNA is a noncontinuous parcel located to the north of the main installation and west of Interstate 95 in Springfield, Virginia. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or NGA, is currently located on the eastern half of the FBNA. The distribution center is proposed on the western portion of the property in an area identified as Area D in the FBNA ADP, which is a largely forested parcel. A closer look at the area shows the distribution center site found by the Fairfax County Parkway and Rolling with the west, Barta Road to the east, and a residential community to the north. Barta Road is a public road that runs through the campus, connecting the Fairfax County Parkway and I-95 via Backlick Road.'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'The distribution center size and security requirements precluded siting within the preferred development areas within the campus core adjacent to the NGA. The proposal is to construct an approximately 525,000 square-foot distribution center to more efficiently process and distribute supplies worldwide in support of the intelligence agency. The project includes a large main warehousing building and administrative spaces, an entry control facility, two surface parking lots, a perimeter security fence with patrol path, and covered and uncovered yard space, a vehicle maintenance facility, and a utility yard. At the concept review in July, the Commission deferred approval of the surface parking lots, the entry control facility, and the perimeter security fence with a request for more information and that the Army evaluate how to further minimize and mitigate impacts to existing trees. The Commission also asked the Army to limit areas of turfgrass and consider meadow plantings and for clarification'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'of the site's tree replacement strategy. The Army revisited the plans and determined that they have reduced the development footprint of the buildings, roads, and perimeter fence to the greatest extent possible while still meeting its programmatic and mission needs. However, the preliminary and final plans include additional information, as requested by the Commission, including a tree preservation and replacement plan and a landscape plan with on-site tree replantings and meadow areas which I will discuss in more detail later in this presentation. In the next few slides, I will provide an update of the elements deferred by the Commission at the concept review. The Army indicated that the proposal includes surface parking and not structured parking for three reasons. First, the surface design provides a low profile to limit visibility from the adjacent neighborhood. Second, the surface lots require less construction intensity than a reinforced concrete parking structure. And,'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'lastly, the surface lots provide additional area to install solar arrays. The entry control facility, or ECF, will be located at the primary entrance to the facility on Barta Road. The ECF consists of a gatehouse with vehicle checkpoint, security parking, visitor parking, inbound lanes and outbound lanes, a rejection security access lane, and an inspection detention lane. The ECF is located to provide required site lines from the gatehouse and to avoid water resources and steep slopes, which results in the elongated roadway leading up to the gatehouse. With regard to perimeter security, a chain link fence is currently installed along 60 percent of the distribution center site limits. Areas of tree clearing already exist around the fence from when it was installed. This fence is compromised in many locations, as seen in the photos on this slide. And while the NGA facility on the east side of the'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'FBNA is secured, the distribution center site is currently not secure. A perimeter security fence is required pursuant to security countermeasures commiserate with the baseline level of protection for a Level IV facility. As a Level IV facility, the minimum setback from the buildings to the uncontrolled perimeter is 350 feet or more wherever possible. The Army proposes to remove the existing chain link fence and install a new nine-foot tall perimeter security fence and associated infrastructure in its place. This will utilize areas of existing clearing, limit additional tree removal, and avoid and minimize impacts to wetlands and RPAs. The remainder of the perimeter fence where no fence currently exists today will follow Fairfax County Parkway and Barta Road and then return to the north. The proposed security fence will be black and an ornamental palisade style similar to the image on the left. As shown on the image'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'on the right, a 30-foot wide clear zone is required to accommodate a 10-foot wide gravel patrol path and a 10-foot wide strip on both sides of the fence for security infrastructure, including lighting, and for site clearance. The cleared areas may consist of low-maintenance meadow and grass plantings. The site borders residential properties to the north where the existing chain link fence is currently used as a boundary marker, as seen in the image on the left. In response to the draft environmental assessment, adjacent residents expressed concerns with the proximity of the proposed security fence and lighting to their properties. NCPC staff requested that the Army evaluate if the proposed fence could be located further south away from the residences. The Army indicated that this would result in foreseeable impacts to wetlands, RPAs, and require additional tree clearing. Therefore, security requirements and environmental constraints necessitate the fence installation'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'at this location. Lighting is required along the secure perimeter per Unified Facilities Criteria. The Army proposes several measures to limit lighting and maximize screening along the northern property line, including full cutoff fixtures, dimming capabilities, and evergreen tree plantings. The Army has indicated that the project design team will continue to work with all stakeholder groups regarding the fence; and, therefore, staff requests the Army continue to work with the adjacent residential property owners to ensure the impacts of the proposed perimeter security fence and lighting are minimal. As you may recall, the amount of tree clearing anticipated for the distribution center increased from 26 acres in the ADP to approximately 40 acres in the concept plans. The Army has indicated that maintaining existing forest cover is a top priority of the project and clearing will be limited to the extent possible. Since the amount of clearing will be'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'close to the limits of grading and development, physical space for on-site replanting is limited and the Army has carefully considered alternative mitigation strategies. The Army proposes to plant 200 trees on site along roadways and as a buffer between the new buildings and the preserved forest areas. And in addition, the Army is in communication with Fairfax County staff to explore opportunities to replant trees off-site within the Accotink Watershed and other nearby areas within the county. The proposed landscape plan includes native tree species and native meadow plantings wherever possible between the edges of the proposed development and the forest line. Turfgrass will be limited to areas around the buildings and along roadways. And here we have a before and after look at an aerial rendering from the concept plans compared with the current proposal. Here you can see an increase in the meadow plantings and tree replantings.'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'In addition, the proposal qualifies for tree replacement deviation criterion one of NCPC's submission guidelines. This criterion allows an application to offset the balance of replacement trees with sustainable or low-impact development strategies when physical space limits the number of trees that can be replanted. The Army proposes a solar panel array that will offset six times the amount of carbon that would have been sequestered by the 40 acres of trees. This amount of solar generation will also offset approximately 53 percent of the site's weekly energy use. In the event that the solar generation exceeds the site's use, the Army is working to add infrastructure to the design which would connect the site to a future potential campus microgrid to further increase the potential impact of the site's renewable energy resources. The proposal would add approximately 26 acres of impervious surface area on site. Stormwater best management practices'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'will be provided, including bioretention basins, below-grade detention and treatment structures, green roofs, and green roofs on the administration buildings. Overall, staff commends the Army for incorporating a robust sustainability program that includes on- and off-site tree replantings, tree preservation areas, solar panels, green roofs, and bioretention. A transportation management plan for the entirety of the FBNA will be developed in conjunction with master planning efforts over the next year. This TMP will reflect differences between functions of the distribution center and the campus floor. A traffic impact study for the distribution center was prepared as part of the NEPA process. As a result, roadway improvements on Barta Road are proposed to facilitate new turning movements to access the distribution center and provide vehicle queuing capacity in turning vehicles. The traffic impact study also accounted for the cumulative volumes of the proposed distribution center and the future Defense Intelligence Agency'",

The proposed distribution center employee parking ratio is 1 to 1.7, which is consistent with the near-term parking ratio approved in the FBNA ADP. This accommodates 350 spaces for 600 personnel. Additional spaces are provided for visitors, government vehicles, and transient employees. And staff reminds the Army that there may be a need to reduce proposed parking in future projects to meet a long-term parking ratio of 1 to 2 for the campus, which was stated in the FBNA ADP. Staff finds the architectural program for the proposed distribution center is appropriate for its use and location within a forested setting. The conceptual theme for the proposed buildings is camouflage where the building facades will utilize textures and materials that blend with the wooded surroundings. The Army proposes vertical-oriented'",

The materials would be neutral in tone and include large format masonry, rough-textured and wood pattern concrete, and metal panels. As mentioned earlier, the proposed distribution center will consist of a one-story high bay building and attached two-story administration building and several separate SCIF spaces with green roofs above the administrative portions of the building. The proposed buildings will be designed to meet a minimum standard of LEED Silver, which is a third-party green building rating standard system intended to facilitate advancements in sustainable building design and construction. The architectural program also includes a gatehouse at the entrance control facility. Similar to the distribution center buildings, there will be metal panel and masonry proposed. And as I have incorporated the executive director's recommendations into my presentation, I will not repeat them here. And this'",

        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'Hello. And thank you very much, Stephanie, Ms. Free. I really appreciate that. And it was a great report, and thank you for your time compiling all of the information and all the work we've done to create the EDR. Also, thank you to the NCPC staff. I think we've, in Ms. Free's words, we have created a very robust plan that meets mission requirements while carefully addressing the concerns on site in environmentally-sensitive areas and for the neighbors. And so I would like to take one minute to speak to some of the neighbor concerns and then come back to the project as a whole. So I believe Mr. Redman is scheduled to speak, but I want to say, Mr. and Mrs. Redman, your concerns have been heard, acknowledged, and thank you for making us part of this proceeding because what has been able to allow us to do,'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'as Stephanie said I believe on slide 16, is roll those concerns into the design itself. And so the downward lighting, dimmable fixtures, and the future evergreen screening, all of those items are part of the considerations that we can put into the design now and not make it as an afterthought as we go along. And those will also be carried into the construction phase. So as the construction phase goes along, particularly with the tree planting plan or the tree replacement plan, we can fine-tune how those things work. So within slide 15, as Ms. Free said, we did very carefully look at what we could possibly do with the security fence requirement. And thank you. I think you quite succinctly described the outcome of that process and the feasibility that preclude us from moving any appreciable differences, you know, a length away from that property line. In'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'slide 16, you know, I think this really comes up to the points of the design that will be incorporated and carried into the construction. I know there's comments about the cameras and the patrol road. I'll get to the patrol road in a minute, but the cameras allow for monitoring of the fence line allow us to not have to have personnel physically there as much. And so we used that capability to reduce the amount of activity or motion along the fence line as much as we can. The term patrol road is a very general term. The DoD likes to use it. Unfortunately, even though we use it all the time, it probably doesn't characterize what the maintenance path along the fence is actually for. It's primarily to allow observation of the fence for maintenance activity. You know, the concept of having personnel constantly roaming around, I'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'think, is certainly not the intent, and so that's why the maintenance path is really in place. The tree replacement plan, as we went through, the evergreens and screenings, you know, we saw the tree replacement plan, but I think that's one spot where we'll be able to, once we're on-site and construction is complete, and bring back the areas of disturbance and replant. That's where we'll be able to fine-tune those concepts. So, finally, I just want to let you know that your concerns have been heard and acknowledged, and they've been incorporated in the design and will be carried further into construction. And we'll be able to address those as we go along. So for the other parts of the plan, I don't have much else to add. We've done a lot of work and a lot of back and forth, not back and forth, collaborative development with'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'the NCPC staff to figure out how we can meet both ends at the same time and create common value between both. One of the portions that we're working with Fairfax County on and that may not be as clear in the tree replacement plan are the carbon offset of the solar panels for the tree removal. Yes, it does greatly compensate for the carbon sequestration that acreage of trees would produce, but we also understand it's only part of it. And so our conversations and partnering with Fairfax County is to focus on the Accotink Creek Watershed and what can be done along the Accotink Watershed within Fort Belvoir or above Fort Belvoir that is controlled by Fairfax County to increase or enhance the biodiversity or the water quality within that watershed. And then, finally, I owe you a TMP still. I haven't forgot about it. It is on'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'contract. If everything goes as planned, we plan to have the heavy work done within the transportation management plan in 2023. So we will come back to that at that time. And I think that's really only the comments. I just want to say thank you. I'm really excited for this project. I think it will show what really can be done for the type of facility it is, but that it fits, that we can fit it within a natural landscape and, in many places, treat the natural resources just as that, as a resource that we can incorporate with the site as a whole. So with that, I'll standby for any questions --'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Oh, okay, Commissioner May. I didn't see that. Sorry. Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I'm slow to pull the trigger here. We saw images of the fence running through the woods, and I am wondering is that the same swath that you'll be going through? Will there be additional tree clearing for that or just sort of cleaning up the scrub that is lying in that open swath?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'Yes, sir. Good question. So with the security fence within the additional acreage that we have accounted for within the offsets, there will likely be some additional clearing that will occur. The current maintenance path I don't think quite meets the standard. And then along with the line of sight to make sure that the fence can be remotely monitored, there will be a little bit of additional clearing that happens. But with some wonderful input, we'll be able to replant not with completely high maintenance, you know, we'll be able to make it match the surrounding a bit more but keeping in mind also that how do we work that evergreen screen in that setting also. So there will likely be some additional tree clearing, but we'll continue to limit it as much as we can once the construction phase starts and we know the actual best alignment, you'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'know, give or take the feet here or there of the fence line.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So how wide is that swath right now?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' I believe it's 10 to 15 feet is what it is right now.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Ten to fifteen feet. You're going to 20 or 30? Because I saw --'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' So the fence line and the maintenance path is 10 feet, and then there's 10 feet on each side that is just not tall trees, and so that will be replanted in a manner that's a little more environmentally sustainable.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' All right. So I'm still confused. So 10 feet fence, roadway, and another 10 feet?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' So there's 10 feet in front of the fence, the fence line, a 10-foot maintenance path, and then a 10-foot replanted area'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So what's the purpose of the extra 10 feet if you already have the maintenance path?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' So that's exactly it. You can see the issues with the current fence and the pieces that fall on it, and so it's the design standard that is required for that type of fence. So what the consideration that we are able to do is, instead of having, you know, low-cut very manicured hibiscus or some type of grass, that we're able to bring up a little bit higher grass lengths with --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Let me just cut you off. It's not about what you're planting for me. It's a matter of understanding what the buffer needs to be on either side. You need to have a tree-free area on both sides of the fence.'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' And you have 10 feet on one side that is low plantings or whatever and then you have 10 feet of path and you have 10 feet of low plantings. So on one side, you've got 20 feet between any trees and the fence and then on the other side you've got 10 feet. And is that the standard?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' Yes, yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I'm having trouble with that logic. I mean, you know, this is something that I think you can work out. Certainly, if there is some reason why it could be reduced, then I'm sure you'll be able to do that because I'm sure you don't want to cut any more trees than you have to. But it just doesn't make any sense that you have to have 10 feet clear on one side and the other side you have to have 20 feet clear. So anyway'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' You know, understood. And I agree with the fact that we -- for two reasons, one, it's costly to clear trees, especially in this area due to some of the constraints. And so, yes, we will reduce the tree clearing as much as possible for that and for just the concepts, you know, that we want to make it as low impact as possible. So as the alignment is actually, in the construction phase, as the alignment is actually made, if there is the opportunity to reduce those barriers in front of the fence line and on the opposite of the maintenance path, then that will be done.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': ' Excuse me. Can you hear me? My name is Charles Redman, and I thought I was led to believe that I'd be able to make a statement.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Mr. Redman.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': ' Yes, ma'am.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' We're going to get to you in just one moment.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': ' Oh, okay. No problem. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Sure. I just wanted to ask the commissioners were there any other questions for Ms. Free or Dr. Bellamy before we get to your testimony. Any other questions? Hearing none, we do have one person signed up to speak, Mr. Charles Redman. Mr. Redman, we appreciate you being here, and you will have three minutes to provide your testimony. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': ' Sure. My name is Charles Redman. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I have a brief statement to read followed by a question. I see I'm not on video for some reason. I don't know why. Okay. Start my video. Very good.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' There you are.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': 'Okay. Thank you. Our home at 7815 Rose Garden Lane in Springfield backs up to the Fort Belvoir North area. We learned of the Army's plans to install a security fence with lighting, cameras, and patrol path less than 30 feet from our rear property line. As plans stand, the installation of a security fence 30 feet from our property will devalue our home and affect our quality of life. In fact, 18 homes in our community of Presidential Hills will be directly and negatively impacted by the security fence installation. The thought of armed military personnel passing by while we're in the so-called privacy of our home, by a see-through security fence is very unsettling, to say the least. However, I was relieved to learn in a conversation with NCPC urban planner, Stephanie Free, that the Army had assured the NCPC of their commitment to be a good neighbor,'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': 'to work with the appropriate professionals to mitigate any adverse effects on neighboring properties. These intentions were reinforced in a letter to us from Colonel Joshua P. Seagraves of the Fort Belvoir Office of the Garrison Commander in which he states, quote, the U.S. government is committed to evaluating additional tree buffer at property lines to provide visual buffer between the perimeter fence and the adjacent residential property. These are comforting words but vague words, as well. If, in fact, this lit, monitored, and patrolled security fence is inevitable, we need specifics on how the Army will accomplish the buffer task. With patrols, cameras, and I must say cameras kind of bother us, and lighting along the security line, along the fence line, it is imperative there be a year-round visual screen between our property and FBNA. Both my wife and I have military roots. My father was a 36-year'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': 'Army veteran and full colonel now buried at Arlington National Cemetery. My wife's father was a liaison officer during the Korean War. And while we understand the U.S. government's position to protect military buildings and personnel, they also have a responsibility to do so without impacting civilian lives. In closing, my question is, with specifics, how exactly is the Army going to provide the year-round visibility buffer between the security fence and our rear property line? And will the Army keep their neighbors abreast of plans moving forward? Thank you, and I'll listen to your reply. Those were the comments that I sent in to the NCPC. However, after listening to Mr. Bellamy, I think I just need to stress the fact that, and I saw the drawings, we need 100-percent visibility barrier. That's the only thing that's going to make us feel okay about the fact that they've got'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': 'cameras there. If they're 360-degree cameras, they've got a straight sideline into our backyard and our privacy. And that's not to mention the patrols that will be going back and forth. So that's my concerns. Mr. Bellamy, if you could give me a little more specifics about how that 100-percent visibility barrier will be accomplished because it can't be accomplished with evergreen plantings because we've got mature deciduous trees back there in that 30-foot buffer that has a tree canopy and no Leyland cypress or evergreen is going to live unless they cut down a bunch of trees, which we don't really want to do. So that's my comments, that's my question. I'll stop and listen to the answer.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Redman. Why don't we address your question first, and then I'll see if there are any questions of you that the commissioners may have, if that's okay. Dr. Bellamy, would you like to speak further to the question from Mr. Redman?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'Yes. And thank you. So the cameras, there's a lot of rules around monitoring, and so the cameras are for view of the alignment of the fence line only. They're not something that we're allowed to, you know, just openly monitor. They have a very specific purpose. And, again, that purpose is to remotely monitor just the security feature, which allows us to reduce the number of people that would be going around your property. And so the second question is a little bit more difficult to answer, and I think there's one more of, you know, how do we keep your privacy, so I will loop that in. And that's through the Army, through the Garrison and/or the Corps of Engineers. And so while the environmental process is going on and then through the garrison. And so that is the point where the tree replacement plan and the landscape'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': 'architects and landscape team will come in. And once we have the final alignments so we can thread that line of not taking down extra trees but also understanding your concerns with your property line that they will be able to come in and help develop a best solution for the screening.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Dr. Bellamy. Are there any questions for Mr. Redman from the commissioners? Hearing none, thank you, Mr. Redman. We really appreciate you being here.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': ' Can I make just one more quick comment? I understand about the rules about the cameras, but can I ask Mr. Bellamy would they be capable of looking into my backyard if they so desired to do so?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' So the actual equipment will be selected as it goes into the construction phase, but I will bring that back to the security team. So my experience in these types of projects is they're fixed cameras so that they look purposely just along one alignment. And that way, the operator knows what section, if he's looking at a specific camera, he knows exactly which section of fence he's looking at. But I understand the concern for that, and I will bring that back to the team that translates design into construction activities and product selection to understand that, you know, there's not a need to have a swinging camera.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': ' Appreciate that. And one final question, is a 100-percent visibility barrier possible? Is that something you think that could possibly be incorporated into this design?'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' You know, sir, I don't know. I will have -- my landscaping capabilities are not good. I cannot grow a garden. And so I will have to leave that with the professionals that do that.'",
        "'MR. REDMAN': ' All right. Well, thank you, Mr. Bellamy. Thank you for your concern. I really appreciate it.'",
        "'DR. BELLAMY': ' Yes, sir. And we will continue to work that problem set as best we can. So thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Well, thank you both. At this point, I'd like to open it up to the Commission for discussion. So if the commissioners would please turn on your cameras, we'll start with Commissioner McMahon and then go in a round robin format using our normal seating order. So please keep your web cams on during discussion. So Commissioner McMahon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thank you. I understand completely the issues with the perimeter of the facility and that those could cause problems for the community around Fort Belvoir. It sounds like Mr. Bellamy and his team have worked very hard with us, the issue and the impacts and will continue to come back to (audio interference) make improvements on the plan from the first (audio interference) to NCPC in terms of reducing the impact of the overall project and on the environment and (audio interference) environmental issues there. So I have no other comments at this time.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yes. So I appreciate the changes that have been made since the last review, which I can't remember exactly when it was. And I appreciate the fact that we now have a drawing that shows meadow planting instead of grass surrounding the road leading up to it. I think that that shows something different and that they're going to keep the actual turfgrass limited to areas where it's really necessary for operational or security reasons. I do still think that road is really super long, and I appreciate that there are great reasons why that's necessary or at least that's what we've been told. But I'm not totally convinced of that because there's very little indication in the drawings that we see that it's actually truly necessary, and I would think that, you know, it would be in the best interest of the agency to build no more road than'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'is absolutely essential. So if there's an opportunity to shorten that road and reduce the asphalt, I think that that would be a good thing, but it's not enough that I would, at this moment, want to slow the project or vote against it. I just think that it's sort of silly to build more road than you really need for functional reasons. You know, as far as the fence goes and the swath and the concerns that were raised today, I think I'm sympathetic to that on a certain level. But my focus is really about loss of existing trees more so than how close are they going to be to the abutting property owners. I mean, the fact that they've got a buffer at all I think is a pretty positive thing and the willingness of the agency to put in plantings that will help to, you know,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'hide is the wrong word but help screen the fence and any lighting. I think that that's positive, and certainly we've seen indication that they're willing to take those comments to heart and work on, you know, minimizing those impacts. But for me, it's really about minimizing the tree clearing, and I'm still not clear on why it has to be 30 feet and not just 20 feet or maybe 22 feet or something like that. But, again, I think it's in the best interest of the agency to minimize that swath for all sorts of reasons, keep it to the minimum that it needs to be for safety and security. And so, hopefully, Mr. Bellamy and his colleagues will take that all to heart and, you know, if you wind up cutting only a 20-foot wide swath instead of a 30-foot wide swath, then that's great.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Commissioner Argo.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' I have, I think I'd like to just, I was going to bring up a couple of things, but they're similar enough to Commissioner May's, you know, always thoughtful comments, I'd like to align myself with his, please.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, ma'am. Commissioner Wright.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I don't have much to add, other than to say I should have asked this before for clarification but did I hear you say this is 26 acres of impervious, well, I mean, it's a combination of building and hardscape and the like. Is that correct?'",
        "'MS. FREE': ' That's correct, yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Okay. Again, I'll take the Army at its word that this is what's necessary for the program. And for 26 acres, it's pretty good. And you've done a lot of work to do all the right things, and I'm not going to quibble about the five feet of the -- I'll leave that to Mr. May. But, yes, what he said, you know, keep going. As you get towards the finish line, I mean, your disposition clearly is moving in the right direction. I don't know how you make something like this artful. I mean, it is what it is, right. So 26 acres of, wow, that's a lot. And for what it's worth, I actually really love these parking lots with the solar arrays on top of them. I was at IKEA the other day. They have it there now, which is kind of amazing, right. I mean, we'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'did it, I think it's IRS New Carrollton. We have a big parking lot out there with it, and it's really actually, it's not a bad place to park either. It's doing its job, but I think keep going. I'm losing my thread here, so I'm going to stop before I crash into something verbally.'",

Well, in conclusion, I would also like to add my thanks for the work of the staff and Dr. Bellamy and your team and continuing to make improvements to this project. I'm particularly impressed that renewable energy is a project goal and that it's integrated into the project design at such an early stage, as Commissioner Wright also noted.

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' So with that, we will move to agenda item 7D, E, and F. They all involve area development plans for Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. We will hear a consolidated presentation regarding all three proposals, and then we will take action on each item separately following the presentation. So welcome, Mr. Weil, for the presentation.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' Thank you very much. I will share my screen. Okay. Can you see the presentation and see me, as well?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes, thank you.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Madam Chair White and members of the Commission. The United States Department of the Air Force has submitted three different District plans for our review here today. The Sentinels of the Capital District Plan is in for final review, and then we have two plans in for draft review and comment: the Housing and Community Support Plan and the Historic Anacostia District Plan. And I would like to note that we will be taking separate actions again, one for each plan, at the end of my combined presentation here during today's meeting. Regarding JBAB's fourth planning District known as the Historic Bolling District, the Commission previously gave final approval to that plan in February 2022, as well as the larger installation development plan and transportation management plan. For the final Sentinels plan, we are considering how the Air Force has addressed our previous'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'comments through the final plan submission. And for the two draft plan submissions, we are considering issues like parking, do the projects support the District's planning objectives, future development siting, and flood resiliency. As a reminder, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, or JBAB, is situated in southeast Washington, D.C. at the convergence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers in Ward 8, bordered by the Naval Research Laboratory to the south, Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge to the north, South Capitol Street and I-295 to the east, and the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers along its west side. JBAB is located approximately 1.5 miles to the southeast of the U.S. Capitol Building and at the base of the Washington topographic bowl just to the west of the Department of Homeland Security's St. Elizabeths West Campus. JBAB has a population of 17,000 military and civilian employees and families, hosting units that include the National Guard, military'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'reserve, United States Coast Guard, and other federal agency personnel. Similar to a small city, the 966-acre installation has a wide range of land uses with approximately a thousand privatized homes and a mix of other uses that include parks and open space, a commissary and base exchange, communications and air facilities, military barracks, child development centers, and administrative buildings. Here are some notable campus landmarks that include the JBAB Marina, Blanchard Barracks, the base exchange and commissary, the Air Force Honor Guard campus, and the Defense Intelligence Agency headquarters building. And one other prominent feature includes the raised earth and levee seawall along JBAB's river shoreline. Originally constructed in 1939, the 1.5 mile raised levee offers panoramic views of Washington, D.C., East Potomac Park, and Reagan National Airport from a trail along its length. Here are the three planning districts under review today, superimposed over a graphic of JBAB's'",
        "'MR. WEIL': '28-mile internal roadway system. Their street network is comprised of primary, secondary, and tertiary roadways, and you will note the installation's primary north-south spine road represented here as the thicker blue line is named Chappie James Boulevard in the south and Defense Boulevard in the north. And the roadway accesses each planning district, as well as JBAB's three operational gates: South Gate, Arnold Gate, and Firth Sterling Gate in the north. As you can see here, about half of the installation is susceptible to flooding with virtually all of the Anacostia District located within a 100-year flood plain shown here in blue and portions of the Sentinels and Housing and Community Support District also in flood-prone areas. And with that larger background installation-wide overview, I will now go through each plan one by one, describing both their contents and our comments. And I will start with the southernmost district, which'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'is named the Housing and Community Support District. The district is currently made up of mostly military housing, as shown in the land use map on the left in purple. Other notable development includes the JBAB Marina, base exchange and commissary, and the South Gate, which currently provides access for employees, visitors, and large commercial trucks. Here are the planning objectives for the district: to leverage its waterfront assets to provide development that supports military and community needs, to improve gate security and efficiency, and to connect and enhance district corridors with trails and open space amenities. The district framework plan which is shown here begins to translate these objectives into future projects, and the plan shows key existing elements that include activity nodes, landmarks, and paths and connections, as well as future planning opportunities. From these, the Air Force developed more defined actions to improve the South Gate's functionality,'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'to establish additional pedestrian and bicycle connections, and to improve local community amenities. And from these, the illustrative plan for the district identifies a number of future projects, which are shown here. Key projects include a potential new community center, an improved marina dock that would accommodate future commuter ferry and water taxi service, and a new family camp area. Other projects include the reconfiguration of South Gate, street improvements along Duncan Street which is a well-used route in the district, a new traffic circle at the intersection of Chappie James Boulevard and Duncan Street, and a new hiker biker trail along an existing CSX right-of-way that is no longer in use as a railway today. And these projects are all proposed in support of district planning objectives. One more project I would like to highlight is the Air Force's intention to develop a number of new community amenities around'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'the district, including an additional waterfront playground or pavilion and renovation of the waterfront dog park with additional shade trees around local playgrounds and other community-gathering spaces. And these enhancements would make the area more usable for nearby residents and JBAB workers. We note that many of these projects would be compatible with their flood plain location based on their nature of streetscape, recreational, and community improvements. However, we note that one project site identified for potential use as a new community center appears to be located within the district's 500-year flood plain, and so we recommend the Air Force plan and design any future development on the site per Executive Order 13690 to reduce the flood risk there, and we reflect these points in the final executive director's recommendation. In addition, we request early consultation with the Air Force and DDOT to study the proposed South Gate reconfiguration which'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'would better accommodate visitors, employees, and charter school drop-off traffic. And one final comment on the district plan for this district is we recommend the Air Force evaluate opportunities to adaptively reuse an existing DC Water pump house near the waterfront in coordination with DC Water and the District State Historic Preservation Office, and we include this point in the final executive director's recommendation. So that concludes my presentation of the Housing and Community Support District Plan, and I will now review the Historic Anacostia District Plan, which is also in for draft review. The Anacostia Planning District encompasses the northern most portion of the installation, which tends to be lower-lying with primary land uses that include mission, administration, and industrial development. In addition, there are several pockets of community support, bachelor housing, and green and recreational space in the extreme northern tip of the district. The area's development pattern'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'reflects its previous operation by the military as an early air field and as a more industrial and service-oriented support facility, formerly known as Support Facility Anacostia before its merger with Bolling Air Force Base in 2010 to form Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. The Anacostia Planning District includes a smaller National Register-listed district which is shown here in orange and known as the Naval Air Station Anacostia Historic District. The area consists of multiple historically-significant buildings, some of which are unused, in poor condition, and experiencing subsiding based on existing soil conditions. Here are some planning objectives for the Anacostia Planning District, enabling mission partners in missions, enhancing base security and force protection, adapting to and mitigating climate change and sea level rise, and providing complete multimodal transportation networks. Similar to the previous Housing and Support Community District Plan, the Anacostia District Framework Plan translates district objectives into more defined actions,'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'such as enabling greater micromobility, improving the functionality of the Firth Sterling Gate, and improving the area that is currently used by the Navy Ceremonial Guard Unit. And from these, the Air Force has identified a number of future projects which are shown here in the Anacostia Illustrative Development Plan before you. The first project I would like to highlight is a new Navy Ceremonial Guard campus that would include an extended quad with better lighting and an outdoor sheltered practice area. The new site would encompass an expanded car-free space between multiple buildings that are currently used by the Ceremonial Guard Unit as storage, fitness, dining, and as a dormitory. And we note our support for the project's concept in the final executive director's recommendation. The Air Force has a high-priority plan to rehabilitate the deteriorating seawall levee system along the waterfront's north end which currently exposes the district'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'to greater flood risk with its lower-lying elevation and poor drainage. And we support the need for the levee seawall improvement and also recommend the Air Force design all new development here to comply with the Executive Order 13690 as an additional risk reduction measure. The Air Force plans to reconfigure Firth Sterling Gate and to develop a new commercial vehicle screening area which would allow more efficient processing of all future commercial truck traffic through a single point. And the new gate and screening area would accommodate appropriate ATFP setbacks and allow for more direct delivery routes to JBAB's nearby service and industrial missions. The new gate would also be designed to better accommodate transit and shuttle buses and to function as more of a transit hub for the installation with its advantageous location closer to the Anacostia Metro Rail Station and to other downtown D.C. destinations. So as'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'part of our comments on the draft Anacostia plan, similar to the future of South Gate reconfiguration comment, we request early consultation with the Air Force and DDOT to better understand the reconfigured gate's future layout, potential alternative configurations, and design assumptions. The future Anacostia Development Plan shows the redevelopment of two of the district's major roadways, Mitscher Road and Defense Boulevard, to better accommodate pedestrian, bicycle, and transit travel with potential new street furniture and additional street trees. And these planning actions would help support several objectives that pertain to providing complete multimodal transportation networks in the district and connecting and enhancing corridors within the area. Here's the deteriorated garage that the Air Force plans to convert into a new surface lot which was recently approved as a delegated action. And the long-term plan for the site is to construct a smaller parking structure to help accommodate additional future'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'JBAB employment with additional parking capacity allocated at no more than a 1 to 3 ratio. Overall, the Anacostia District Plan shows a total future parking capacity reduction of approximately 570 spaces with the removal of surface lots as part of the new screening facility in the north and lot reductions associated with the new Ceremonial Guard campus development. We note the Anacostia District Plan has objectives and language that speak to supporting micromobility in the area and to promote more biking, walking, and transit use. And in support of JBAB's planning efforts here, we recommend the Air Force explore the feasibility of connecting the northern end of the levee path to the sidewalk along South Capitol Street in order to shorten the travel distance for pedestrians and bicyclists to downtown locations over the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge. The Air Force now has submitted each of its district plans for'",

Based on our review of the Anacostia, Sentinels, and other plans, the Air Force plans to replace employee parking at a 1 to 1 ratio as it consolidates surface parking in the future garages. And future parking capacity increases would be tied to employment increases based on a limited 1 to 3 ratio. And the Air Force will use this approach to gradually attain the transportation management plan's overall 1 to 3 long-term goal for the installation. However, staff finds this approach, parking replacement on a 1 for 1 basis and capacity increases based on a 1 to 3 ratio, while this approach will improve the installation's ratio over time, the Air Force needs to limit new capacity even further'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'if the installation is to attain its 1 to 3 goal by the 2041 target year. Thus, we advise the Air Force to develop a reliable means to ensure that future projects do not result in excess parking, and we also include a request in the final executive director's recommendation to review JBAB's TMP data periodically so that we can help the Air Force attain their future travel and parking-related goals. Based on its review of the Anacostia District Plan, the D.C. State Historic Preservation Office has expressed concerns with the Air Force's proposal to develop a new Navy Ceremonial Guard campus with the project's potential to affect the integrity of the National Register-listed Naval Air Station District. And we note D.C. SHPO's concerns and support the recommendation for early project consultation between the Air Force, D.C. SHPO, and NCPC in the final executive director's recommendation. Finally, we have several'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'requests for additional information in the final Anacostia District Plan, but we are particularly interested in the Air Force's ongoing efforts and future plans to develop additional renewable energy sites at JBAB. And these would be in addition to several existing sites, which are highlighted here on the slide. So we request an informational briefing to the Commission on the Air Force's future renewable energy plans in the final executive director's recommendation. And with this slide, that concludes my review of the draft Anacostia District Plan. Here is the third and final plan in for final review, the Sentinels of the Capital District Plan, and we previously reviewed this plan as a draft a few months ago, back in June 2022. As a reminder, the district is situated in the central part of JBAB adjacent to the waterfront, encompassing an air field, Geisboro Park, and several larger higher security mission'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'complexes that require restricted access, larger setbacks, and secondary perimeter security. The district planning objectives remain unchanged from the draft document with objectives that include enabling mission partners in unique missions, consolidating parking, and making efficient and effective use of limited land in the Sentinels district. Similar to the other plans, the final Sentinels Framework Plan, which remains unchanged from its draft, translates district objectives into the future projects that are shown here in the district development plan, and these remain unchanged from the draft Sentinels plan. As previously noted in our draft review, all the proposed new development would still be located outside of the district flood plain areas. In our previous draft review, we provided the Air Force with three recommendations which are shown here on this slide. The Air Force responded to our first recommendation by adding a second build-to line directly adjacent to Chappie James Boulevard'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'to represent the possibility of closer development to the street and, in the case of a larger development setback in the future, the Air Force would still remove the surface parking along Chappie James and possibly redevelop the site as a potential park, expanded outdoor seating and eating area, or simply replant the area as attractive landscaping. The final plan continues to reflect planned and notional future parking consolidation sites on existing lots in response to our second recommendation. And, finally, the Air Force does show a preserved waterfront area with only a smaller-scale potential project that would expand an existing military working dog facility there. And we note the Air Force elected to forego a more ambitious dormitory project near the river front, which is shown here on the left, in an effort to preserve the open character of the waterfront as it exists today. Thus, staff is satisfied'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'with the Air Force's responses as reflected in the final Sentinels District Plan submission. Staff is also generally satisfied with the Air Force's responses to our requests for additional information, noting the new JBAB installation facility standards document will include additional guidance on tree planting locations, as well as viewshed preservation through its architectural standards which will include standards for historic structures. And we request to review an early version of the future installation facility standards document prior to a formal review submission to the Commission so that staff can make sure the document includes the type of information that would benefit our Commission's review role and help support our comprehensive plan policies, and we include this request in the final executive director's recommendation. And we include the same parking-related language in the final approval recommendation for the Sentinels District Plan, which I previously reviewed as part of the Anacostia'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'District Plan, since we need to review individual future JBAB projects with a longer-term installation-wide planning context in mind. So with that, that concludes my presentation. And as a reminder, we will be taking three separate actions here today: first, to approve the final Sentinels of the Capital District Plan; second, to approve comments on the draft Housing and Community Support District Plan; and, third, to approve comments on the Historic Anacostia District Plan. And each specific set of comments are laid out before you in our staff EDRs, and I have also described our comments through the course of my presentation. And one last note is that we have representatives here today from JBAB who are available to answer any questions by the Commission. And I would now like to introduce Colonel Ryan Zeitler who serves as a Vice Commander of the Air Force's 11th Wing, and he would'",

        "'COL. ZEITLER': 'Our apologies. We have, like, four microphones to choose from, but we eventually found the right one that's registering us. So I'll restart. Good afternoon to the Commission members. I'm Colonel Ryan Zeitler. I'm the Vice Commander here at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, and I have about five minutes and I'll re-hit some of the same points that Mr. Weil briefed so well. Thank you, Mr. Weil, for that great brief. And I'm also joined here by three colleagues, Kat Keller-Kratzer, Jeremy Gerrard, and Mark Berger who are leaders, engineers, and planners within our civil engineer squadron here at JBAB. So as Mr. Weil said, we are asking for final approval of our Sentinels of the Capital District Plan and then preliminary review of the Historic Anacostia District Plan and the Housing and Community Support District Plan for three of our four district plans here on JBAB. So as some of'",
        "'COL. ZEITLER': 'you might recall, the lead military service in charge of JBAB was transferred from the Navy to the Air Force in October 2020. And since that day, we've been what we call initial operational capability as we've built up from scratch the Air Force's 11th Wing, which is charged with the installation leadership or JBAB. As part of that process, we have been preparing several master planning documents, most of which Mr. Weil already mentioned. Our Installation Development Plan, which was approved in February; our four district plans, one of which was the Historic Bolling District Plan and was approved in February, as well, and the other three we're talking about today; our transportation plan, and then our installation facility standard is under development, as well as our installation energy plan. And once we get the Air Force guidance, the climate resilience plan will be underway, as well. In October'",
        "'COL. ZEITLER': '2022, still a month away, October 1st, we hit what we call final operational capability, which is essentially the two-year mark of our existence where we're supposed to be treated basically just like any other Air Force base or joint base in this case. Leading up to today's meeting, the 11th Wing, we circulated these three district plans among our 73 mission partners. For example, our mission partners include the Defense Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard Station Washington, White House Communications Agency; those are just three examples of those 73 mission partners that are across the base, as well as Air Force leadership, 11th Wing leadership, and GSA. So we incorporated comments from NCPC, from GSA, and DHS into the final Sentinels of the Capital District Plan that we're seeking final approval for today. We've also maintained our ongoing relationships with the State Historical Preservation Office and the Department'",
        "'COL. ZEITLER': 'of Energy and the Environment with our 11 civil engineers squadron environmental unit, and we've engaged with NCPC on a lot of other JBAB projects in the last six months, such as the charter school addition for D.C. Learn, or Learn D.C. rather; the landscaping plan for the Defense Intelligence Agency; and the parking garage demolition; as well as various projects, a few of which were discussed earlier today. So I'm going to just hit the three plans real quick. I'll go in the order that Mr. Weil briefed. The Housing and Community Support District Plan presents our future long-term development focused on a new South Gate and entrance control facility integrated with a multimodal transportation facility, as well as a new multimodal terminal at the marina serving fast ferry, also a network of multiuse trails connecting to the other three districts on JBAB, waterfront lodging for Department of Defense'",
        "'COL. ZEITLER': 'staff, and, finally, a regulating plan to maintain the existing privatized housing neighborhoods. The second plan for review today is our Historic Anacostia District Plan, which is named after the former Historic Anacostia Navy Base, and presents our future long-term development focused on similar items: the potential 11th Wing and mission partner space needs; second, a new Firth Sterling entry control facility integrated with a multimodal transportation facility; third, a network of multiuse trails connecting to the other three JBAB districts and South Capitol Street trail; fourth, the formal U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard campus; and, fifth, a regulating plan to encourage development in developed areas while restricting development of the waterfront and areas adjacent to active air fields. And then, finally, what we're seeking final approval for today, the Sentinels of the Capital District Plan, which follows Air Force Instruction 32-1015. We have a lot of those; that's just one'",
        "'COL. ZEITLER': 'of many. And that presents our future long-term development focused, again, on potential mission partner space needs, multimodal transportation improvements, multiuse trails, a new transit hub, consolidated parking by constructing a new three-level parking structure to replace several existing surface lots, and, again, adhering to that regulating plan, we encourage develop in existing parking lots and open space and, again, restrict waterfront and recreational development. So all of these documents, they are housed on our Air Force comprehensive planning platform where we can continue to manage them dynamically. The installation facility standards, which we referenced briefly earlier, it is still under development. We will ultimately house the installation standards and it will replace the existing installation appearance plan. And this specifically addressed comments from NCPC, and the IFS will include architectural, site planning, and roadway cross-section guides, as well as street canopy priorities. That will be brought for NCPC review'",
        "'COL. ZEITLER': 'as soon as we can obtain a current concurrence with our 73 mission partners: JBAB, the Air Force architect, Air Force leadership, and the lead commander here, the base commander of JBAB. I do want to mention something. You had mentioned something about the solar panels for --so the plan for the solar panels that was brought up briefly by Mr. Weil, that will live in the installation facility standards. And then our last comment, we plan to continue to engage with Ward 8 and continue our active coordination role with the 11th Wing, with DHS and GSA, as well as our partners at the State Historical Preservation Office, the Department of Energy and the Environment, and the Department of Transportation, or DDOT as we begin a number of NEPA actions and to upgrade our gates, implement mission (audio interference) and MILCON projects. So with that, that's the end of'",

        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'First of all, always excited about things happening on Bolling, JBAB, joint base. As a kid, I used to try to sneak in there so I could use the indoor basketball court, but now I've got privileges as an O-6 myself. I can get in when I kind of want to. What I wanted to know about is you mentioned, and I'm sure it's happening, the coordination with the 11th Street Bridge on the Anacostia River side east. Is that going on? I guess that area is ongoing because they're doing a lot of wonderful things there, and I don't know whether the trucks coming in to the Firth Sterling entrance will be unsightly or will be necessary but fit right in. I hope they do. Another point -- I kind of run through them and let you all speak if you can remember what I mentioned worthwhile. I'm very'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'excited about your solar panels. You know that. That's one of my things, kind of. But I want to be sure, I want to ask really the question whether you're looking at solar panels to accommodate the vehicles and other things, or are you looking at them adding to the grid, broader than just taking care of the needs of the buildings around and guards? I'm curious about that. So I think that may run it. And I remember that facility when the planes were landing there, so that kind of dates me, I guess. Thank you. I'll turn it over to you now. Thank you.'",

        "'BERGER': ' Can you hear me here?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Yes, I can. That's much better. KELLER-KRATZER I'll move down to here so you can hear me. Kat Keller Kratzer, Deputy Civil Engineer and I\u2019ll answer the questions for Commissioner Dixon. So to start off with the Firth Sterling Gate and that reconfiguration and how it interacts, we're being very sensitive with that design to make sure that we can accommodate multi-modes of transportation. We're aware that, you know, moving truck traffic down South Capitol Street is definitely going to have an impact on our neighbors, as well as DDOT in particular. So we're at the very early stages of that, particularly since DDOT has spent a good deal of time and effort reconfiguring that roadway, the traffic ovals, and (audio interference) bridge. So we'll continue to look at that. We're excited to be able to tie into the South Capitol Street trail there to be able to give our'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'residents and commuters a different option to be able to get on and off the installation in a safe manner. As for the solar panels, the Air Force has what's called a power purchase agreement, so the existing panels we have on the base actually do help us buy down our electric bill. So we essentially lease space, and it shares back the cost that way. So it is very much in our benefit to buy down those utility bills over time. We're not just doing them for shade. It's a nice bonus, but, as we're looking at our facilities that are existing, as well as future buildings and parking areas, we are looking to try to reduce that electric bill overall with solar energy.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Okay. I appreciate it very much. Also, I will mention I'm moving to another which you have nothing to do with, but as long as we keep possible fuel driving cars, given charging cars and given this electricity, we're back in the same situation. So we all know we've got to move to, but I don't think you can do anything about that. One thing we can do is start looking at hydrogen-powered cars and not electric-powered cars where you don't have that issue. But I'm drifting out of my place right now. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. Commissioner Cozart. Sorry? KELLER-'",
        "'KRATZER': ' I just wanted to mention, I know it's not part of the plan, but we've actually been tagged as one of the pilot installations to look at electrical vehicle charging stations, so we're working with that right now to try to see. It's for the government vehicles obviously, not for government fleets. But GSA does have a mandate to start rolling a lot of those vehicles over to electric, and we're very much trying to incorporate that here.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Great. Thank you. Commissioner Cozart.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Yes. I appreciate the presentation. I wanted to get a little bit of understanding on a couple of things related to the Historic Anacostia District Plan. I'm wondering, given kind of the State Historic Preservation Office's concerns related to specifically proposed demolition for Building 91, the plane hangar, and Building 93, the bachelor's officers quarters, what are some of the options under consideration for reuse of those buildings, repurposing? And are there some other options, what are some of the other options that the Air Force is looking at related to providing some ceremonial parade grounds, especially given other open space and parking lots that exist on the campus?'",
        "'MR. GERRARD': 'Hello. My name is Jeremy Gerrard. I'm the engineering flight chief for 11th Civil Engineers Squadron and for the base. So the plan for Building 91 and Building 93, per the district plan, does show demolition. But, obviously, in considering the D.C. SHPO's comments, we are also now working and considering other options. So for Building 93, we do have some concerns there. It is subsiding due to the soil factors that are there. So Building 93 will be a bit challenging. It will also require a lot of maintenance over the long term. Now, 91 is a little bit different. The hangar itself, not the slab on grade but the hangar itself they built on, appears. So that one should have some opportunity that we will be considering internally in how it fits in to the district's (audio interference). And so we have some ideas there to try to'",
        "'MR. GERRARD': 'meet the HPO's concerns but also try to meet NCPC's idea, or not ideas but concerns about more open and green space, as well as our internal requirements. So we're trying to balance all of that out.'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Any other questions, Commissioner Cozart? Thank you. Any other questions from other commissioners? Hearing none, I will now open it up to the Commission for discussion. So would everyone please turn on your cameras. I will start, very appropriately so, with Honorary Commander Argo and then go in a round robin format using our normal seating order. So if everyone would please keep your web cams on during the discussion. And just a reminder that your comment can refer to the final approval of the Sentinels of the Capital District Plan, JBAB's draft Housing and Community Support District Plan, or the draft JBAB Historic Anacostia District Plan. And with that, Commissioner and Honorary Commander Argo.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Thank you. I have sort of an overarching question, and I don't think I've heard this before. I was curious whether or not there is a community group in place that the JBAB folks work with. Is there a community group that they -- I'm trying to think of -- not an ANC or maybe it would be an ANC or something like that that the folks at JBAB work with on a regular basis as they're developing plans, these sorts of plans that, in most cases, have an impact on the community? I have not heard that exists.'",

It does help us to, you know, integrate with Ward 8, our neighbors. I would kind of have to look into how frequently it meets, how effective that feedback is from those sessions. I haven't personally been to one in the last (audio interference), but I know it exists (audio interference) but don\u2019t know how robust it is in getting feedback from the community (audio interference).'",

I'm kind of having a little brain fog on the name of them, but I think one of them is an Anacostia group that we do attend every time (audio interference) to participate. We also presented them our IDP, our installation development plan, so they could get a better understanding of what we were planning on doing.

We're trying to encourage shared resources, and I know there's been some conversation about fleet electrification and charging stations and the like, and I'm hoping that we can eventually maybe not, you know, tomorrow but soon, we'll work something out, whether it's -- because, I mean, this would -- JBAB has more room, frankly, than St. Elizabeths does for charging stations, but proximity gets the kiss, right.

And I want to make the point again I'm starting a new thing here, as long as we're generating solar energy, as long as we're generating electric car services but fossil fuel providing it, we're right back where we started. And I do hope that people will begin to think about the hydrogen fuel. Tesla is already beginning to do that, develop hydrogen-powered vehicles which gets rid of all the fossil stuff. And I think we've got to go down the right track here in technology, even though electric is a good start. Thank you. Bye-bye.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Sure, yes, I've got a couple of things to say. First of all, I have a question for Commissioner Dixon about his, since he can go on base now because he has privileges, does that mean he goes in to the indoor basketball court to play?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Well, I haven't done that recently, Peter, I'm sorry to say.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'I could easily picture you being out there. Anyway, I will say a few things. First of all, I think one of the things that's most remarkable about getting to this stage and seeing so much information, well, it's two things. One is it's a lot information and it's a lot of work, and kudos to Mr. Weil for digesting it all and bringing it all down to something that's understandable for all of us. But also, knowing that what we're seeing is just a snippet of the work that he's doing, so, you know, he and others on the staff I'm sure are working very hard to help this plan, you know, come to a better result. And I do appreciate that. The second thing I would say is that, you know, the whole nature of the relationship between NCPC and Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling has evolved so much over'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'my years on the Commissioner, and it has improved, I think, very significantly. And I really appreciate, you know, the current leadership and the recent past leadership in making the changes that were necessary to sort of think about planning this base in a way that really aligns with the kinds of objectives that NCPC lays out for federal agencies, including DoD agencies. And that's not always been the case, and I know it can be a struggle, given, you know, changes in leadership over time and things like that. But it is very, very important, and I have witnessed how much it has evolved and how much it has improved. And I really do appreciate that because the last thing we want is to have, you know, contentious meetings and having to push back hard on agencies that are not holding up their end of the bargain when it'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'comes to intelligent planning in the Washington area. I will say also that there are aspects, I mean, I think that the particulars of the plan, the way it has been laid out, is fine because, you know, we are just talking about planning at this point, as opposed to specific development projects. And I think it lays out very important aspirations. They're not as clearly enunciated as maybe I would like because I would like to lead with, you know, aspects of renewable energy and planting trees and making a better pedestrian environment and reducing vehicles and things like that and putting that really at the headline of a plan like this. But, you know, we have to pack so much into the plans that sort of the aspirations get lost in all of the words. But I do see clear messages here, which are those same themes. It's'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'renewable energy, it's more trees, better pedestrian experience, better bicycle experience, and I really think that -- and, of course, less cars and electrically-charged or hydrogen-powered cars, all of that. I mean, I think these are all good aspirations. And I think that what we're seeing here really can be the floor, it doesn't need to be the ceiling. And the way this site appears 20 or 30 years from now can be dramatically different because of the plans that are laid out today, and I think that it should be. And I'm feeling good that it will be. And I am looking forward to riding the bike path across the South Capitol Street Bridge and along the waterfront (audio interference). And that's it. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Commissioner May. Well, I too would like to give my thanks to staff and to the team for working so collaboratively on this. We really appreciate the planning work that's being done at this installation, and I personally look forward to seeing more of the details related to renewable energy, sustainability, and landscaping with the submission of the installation facility standards document. And as we all saw here today, Department of Defense installation planners are being very proactive in terms of sustainability, and I just want to encourage you to keep going. This is really great work, and we're appreciative of improvements of the plan over time, as Commissioner May was just saying. I also appreciate the effort to recapture space from surface parking to create the new quad. I think that will make a huge difference in how people will experience the place. So thank you again.'",

    "10. NEW SMITHSONIAN MUSEUMS SITE EVALUATION STUDY ": [
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' And now we will move to the last item on our agenda. It's an information presentation on the new Smithsonian Museum's site evaluation study, and we will be hearing from Mr. Flis.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Thank you, Chair White. Good afternoon, Commissioners. Hopefully, you can see my screen. The purpose of this information presentation is to provide an update on the Smithsonian Institution's site evaluation study for two new museums, the National Museum of the American Latino and the American Women's History Museum. The Smithsonian previously provided updates to you all in December of 2021, March of this year, and then most recently in July. This is the final update before the Smithsonian's Board of Regents makes their site selections later this year. So just as a reminder, the legislation that established the two new museums provides that the Smithsonian Board of Regents designate sites for the museums by December of 2022. The legislation also requires that the Board of Regents carries out the site selection process in consultation with, among others, the Chair of NCPC. As such, NCPC has an advisory role. In past'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'site selections, the Chair has generally provided a letter to the Board of Regents with comments or recommendations. And as I have mentioned, this is the last briefing, and the Smithsonian will be providing an update on the short list of sites, the proposed program, as well as some massing studies and test fits for those sites, so you can see how they are starting to lay out. Following site selection and transfer of any necessary land to the Smithsonian, NCPC will have review authority for the site and building plans for the museums pursuant to the Planning Act. So just a reminder, there were 26 initial sites that were narrowed down to 14 tier one sites, and now the Smithsonian has identified these four focus sites, which they're going to go through in more detail but they include the Arts and Industries Building, Northwest Capitol, the South Monument, and'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Tidal Basin sites. So in terms of next steps, the Secretary of the Smithsonian has requested comments from the Chair by September 15th. These will be provided to the Board of Regents as they deliberate their site selections. And so with that as background, I'm going to now turn it over to Mr. Ron Cortez with the Smithsonian Institution who is going to provide some remarks and kick off their presentation. Following their presentation itself, I'm going to return with some concluding slides and some discussion of staff's comments on the sites. And so with that, I will turn it over to Mr. Cortez.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. It is our pleasure to meet with you again. As Matt mentioned, this will be our final briefing to NCPC prior to completing our site evaluation report for the Regents' use in selecting for the National Museum of the American Latino and the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum. We look forward to receiving your input on our presentation today. With me today, I also have Lisa Sasaki, Interim Director of the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum; and I have Jorge Zamanillo, Director of the National Museum of the American Latino. Next slide. Our agenda today includes a quick recap of our previous briefings and presentation of additional site analysis work completed in the past few months to study the most promising sites in greater detail. Next slide. The following slides summarize our previous briefings. Next slide. We have presented to NCPC three times'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'since November, last November, to explain the scope of the study and to provide updates on our progress, including the development of a planning level space program, outreach activities, and analysis of the sites and the existing buildings. Next slide. In response to NCPC feedback dated on July 25th, we wanted to just clarify that this site we intend to remove from consideration and that we are currently directing our resources to the four focus sites to include more detailed massing and program test studies which we will share with you today reflecting the primacy of the National Mall location. Next slide. The enactment of the legislation of December 2020 has informed our study, including its requirements for consultation with external parties, criteria for selecting, and a time frame of two years. This slide illustrates the common requirements pertaining to both museums. Next slide. In addition to the legislative requirements'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'for both museums, there also are other requirements that were provided in the legislation specific to each museum, and we have been careful to take those into account in our process. Next slide. We have worked, as Matt mentioned, from a list of 27 sites. Initially, there were 26 and we added one based upon public input as we began our study. Next slide. As discussed in previous presentations, we narrowed our list down to tier one sites. Those were designated as more likely to be able to accommodate the museum. There were also tier two sites which we found were either unavailable or unlikely to meet the Smithsonian's needs for the museum. Next slide. We conducted nine focus groups with constituents of both museums in late November and early December of last year. Those results helped us refine our criteria for our site selection, although eight or nine sections'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'were specific to one or the other museum. The high-level takeaways were quite similar for both of the museums. Next slide. In March, we conducted a national survey that reached a larger group of people, including panels drawn from across the country and reflective of national adult demographics, as well as outreach groups invited to respond via Smithsonian social media and list of interested stakeholders. Outreach groups for each museum were more similar to each other than outreach versus the panel groups for each museum. Next slide. For both museums, respondents were open to either a new building or the reuse of a historic building. This was significant since one of our focus sites was the Arts and Industry Building, but they preferred to know the specific details before making a decision. Next slide. As mentioned and discussed in previous meetings with NCPC, these are the primary criteria that we'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'looked at. Our analysis used a specific and consistent criteria to evaluate tier one sites to identify the four focus sites; and Luanne, President of ASG, will discuss those in further detail as part of her presentation. Some of these criteria, including cost factors and proximity to the National Mall and public transportation were identified in the enactment of the legislation. Others derived from sound planning practices and the unique particulars of planning the major museums in the vicinity of the National Mall. Next slide. Our work since the last presentation with NCPC has emphasized the depth of analysis of the four focus sites within the tier one group. Next slide. This map once again shows the four focus sites. These include three of the four sites identified for consideration in the enactment legislation: the Arts and Industry Building, the South Monument site, the North Capitol site. And the Tidal'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'Basin, as mentioned previously, was brought forward by a member of the public and added for consideration last spring. These four sites does satisfy the selection criteria. I will now go ahead and would like to introduce Luanne Green, President of the consulting and architecture planning firm of Ayers Saint Gross to present the additional detailed information of these focus sites. Luanne.'",
        "'MS. GREENE': ' Great. Thanks, Ron. Can you hear me okay?'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Yes.'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'Great. Wonderful. Well, good afternoon, everyone. We can go to the next slide, or, no, you're already got it, I think. Our objective for this stage of the planning process is to assess the capacity of the sites to accommodate the almost-sufficient-size function and flexibility. This is a planning study, not a design proposal in any way. Planning considerations include issues such as the urban context, environmental conditions, views, massing, height, functionality, and program orientation and organization. Next slide. The sites were tested against a preliminary set of working program guidelines. This framework allowed us to generate site planning strategies and massing diagrams for how a museum might fit on each site. Next slide. We're going to start with AIB, or Arts and Industries Building, frequently referred to as AIB. This is an amazing building with a premier site right on the Mall, immediately adjacent to the Castle. Today it'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'has a main story and mezzanine with wonderful double-height spaces and tons of natural light. It has a very large footprint that fills its site. Next slide. Because the existing building fills the site, and because of the amount of existing space that can be made environmentally suitable for museum collections is limited, we are looking at expanding the basement -- expanding the building by adding to the basement. The lowest basement would be non-public support space. And the first basement, just under the main floor, would focus on public collections space, with precision environmental controls, the type of space that is very limited above in the existing building. So, the next slide. This is a diagram of how we go straight down below the existing building with two basements. Next slide. In addition to the basements directly under the existing building, we also looked at an option of expanding'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'the footprint of the basements to the west to gain additional space. If you go to the next slide, on the upper drawing I think you can see that expansion to the west, just stepping out of the footprint of the AIB. Next slide. We did look at another option for expanding public collections space for the AIB, but this is not actively being pursued at this time. Next slide. We looked at an expansion of the basements to the north, under Jefferson Drive and a portion of the elm tree panel in the Reserve. Next slide. Because the grade of the site drops to the north, this expansion would need to be even lower than the basements directly under the existing building. And, again, this option is not actively being pursued at this time. So, next. Perfect. The second focus site is the South Monument, is in the Reserve'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'southeast of the Washington Monument. This site is the twin of the National Museum of African American History and Culture to the north, marking the western end of where the Mall meets the monument grounds. And we're looking at two options at South Monument. So, next slide. In both options the development site is constrained above ground by a significant setback from the Mall. While this setback can be seen as an advantage in that it creates an opportunity for outdoor space, it limits the building footprint above grade, and decreases the space efficiency overall so it's growing taller and skinnier. And like the African American History and Culture Museum, we have looked at a basement level that extends below the setback and fills the site. Next slide. So, in Option 1, the massing is five stories above grade and one basement below grade. We can go ahead to the'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'next slide. Option 2 takes the same strategy on site development and massing above ground, but looks at additional space below grade, actually up to four basement levels, which is very similar to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. If we go to the next slide, I think we can see Option 2 with the massing five stories up, up to four basements below. Next slide. Because the above grade massing is the same for both Option 1 and Option 2, this is the view of the site from the Mall for both options. So, you can see that rough massing, not a design potential but just a rough massing of the height and footprint and how that would look set on the site. Our third site is at the Tidal Basin. This is the site that was added during the process. Unlike other focus sites, this'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'site has not been considered in previous museum site selection processes. The site is bounded by a triangle of roads, with the rugby field at its center, and trees along the perimeter. It is immediately west of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Go to the next slide. The site is large enough to meet the test program. The triangular massing echoes the triangular shape of the site, with five floors above ground and one below. The exterior space around the building is large in area but not consolidated because it's wrapped around the edges of that triangle, as opposed to some of the other opportunities where there's more consolidated outdoor space for the program. And I think if we go to the next slide we can look at the sections of that. We can see its relation to the Holocaust Memorial Museum. And the next slide is a view'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'from Independence Avenue and Raoul Wallenberg Place. And, again, you just see the overall height and massing that's not a design. Great. Then the next, the fourth focus site is the Northwest Capitol site. This is a large site east of the National Gallery's East Building, and just below the foot of Capitol Hill. Next slide. In fact, the massing and form are very similar to that of the East Building. We explored a massing with five stories above ground and one partial basement below. The western side of the site is above the I-395 tunnel, which creates a large building setback and limits site development, but it offers a great opportunity for outdoor space above the tunnel. Security, due to the close proximity to the Capitol, may pose restrictions on design or operations. If we go to the next slide, you can see the section 3 sees the Capitol'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'up on the left, and the slope of Capitol Hill. The height is very similar to the Rayburn House Office Building, the Humphrey Building, the National Gallery East Building, and the National Museum of the American Indian. And then if we go forward, this is the view from Pennsylvania Avenue and 4th Street, N.W. Again, just the massing, no design. So, that was a high level overview of the four focus sites. We have reviewed the rating criteria in our previous meetings, but just wanted to refresh your memory. So, if we go to the next slide. In order to evaluate the sites within a consistent objective framework, an analytical model was created. The six primary criteria each had sub-criteria with a significant, with the significance established after discussions with stakeholders. The significance of each sub-criterion was established as either most critical, critical, important, or desirable. Each sub-criterion was graded'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'as very good, good, moderate, or poor. A weighting factor was applied to the sub-criterion grade. And an additional weighting factor was applied to acknowledge the significance of location, cost factors, and development complexity. The resulting scores are expressed as a percentage. We can go to the next slide. Just a reminder that today's presentation is an update. The process is ongoing. This is a summary of the scores for the Tier 1 site as of last week. This is really a living document, updated to reflect ongoing input from stakeholders through further analysis of the sites. The scores on the four focus sites we shared today range from very good to good. So, it's 78 percent for the Arts and Industries Building; 70 percent for South Monument; 67 percent for Northwest Capitol; and 62 percent for the Tidal Basin site. So, Ron, I think I will hand it back'",
        "'MS. GREENE': 'to you, or back to Matt. I'm not sure.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Yes. Thank you, Ms. Greene. Let me just get my camera on. So, thank you for that presentation. As I mentioned before, I'd like to conclude by walking through staff's initial comments on the focus sites, including our observations. I'm going to walk through them in order of what we consider the most viable to the least viable site. And then I will conclude with a discussion about an alternative approach. So, first, on the Arts and Industries Building, we feel it's a clear frontrunner. The AIB offers the prominence and visibility of a site directly on the National Mall within the Smithsonian South Mall Campus. Because it's already under the Smithsonian's jurisdiction, the building could perhaps most quickly be realized as a building, as a museum building. The site is also not located within the Reserve, which was mentioned previously. And as a reminder, Congress established the Reserve as'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'that no-build zone within the monumental core. As you just heard, the Smithsonian's analysis appears to show that they could accommodate the museum program within the building or in areas adjacent, excavated to the building. I'll just mention that through the South Mall Campus Master Plan, NCPC has already expressed some support for some amount of excavation, particularly between AIB and the quadrangle, which is located to the west. However, I would note that excavations to the north under Jefferson Drive and into the National Mall we feel should be avoided due to those impacts to the National Park Service property. I'll note that the national landmark designation of AIB does create some challenges. This is an historic building. But the building's architecture and also its history as a museum do create an opportunity and innovative design team who's willing to take this on. So, next, moving on to the'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Northwest Capitol site, we also find that this is a strong candidate site. Again, the site is located on the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol grounds. It's also located on Pennsylvania Avenue and, therefore, it has significant prominence from a variety of perspectives. This site has an opportunity to create a, perhaps the most functional open space. As you've heard, a portion of the site would be left open due to the tunnel beneath the site. This open space could, in turn, connect to Pennsylvania Avenue and the many events and activities which are located on this nationally symbolic corridor. Like AIB, this site has the benefit of not being located in the Reserve. And while the location is an incredible asset, impacts to the setting of the U.S. Capitol, important view-sheds, as well as security needs would all need to be considered and studied as part of the'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'development of any building for this site. So, moving on, the Tidal Basin site yields a number of significant challenges. This site is located within the Reserve and was not specifically identified in the enabling legislation. I'll also mention that this site has never been identified in any NCPC plans for a potential museum, including the Legacy Plan and the Memorial and Museums Master Plan. Perhaps most significantly, a building at this location, which is highlighted here in blue, has the potential to alter views within that primary north-south vista connecting the White House and the Jefferson Memorial. This connects those, you know, nationally symbolic structures, memorials, monuments, and buildings. The introduction of a building at this location would likely impact views to the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial, as well as the setting -- settings for these two iconic structures. Finally, the site is also an actively-used recreation'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'space. As mentioned, it's a rugby field that is used. And it's also used on occasion for staging for events on the National Mall. The elimination of this space could have impacts for those users. And as such, we would strongly encourage the Smithsonian to avoid these significant constraints and consider other sites. Finally, the South Monument site is also significantly challenged, like the Tidal Basin site. This is located within the Reserve. And the Smithsonian's analysis indicates to us that the site is really just too small to accommodate the necessary museum program without an offsite space or significant multi-level excavation that would be challenging and costly to implement. The small block size could also impact the layout of any building floor plates and exhibition space. And according to the Smithsonian's analysis, the resulting building massing appears to staff much too large for this relatively small area. Other constraints'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'during the design process would likely further restrict the height and building envelope. These including preserving view-sheds to the Washington Monument and the preservation of the setback defined by the McMillan Plan as shown here on the screen. And this is an excerpt actually from the analysis that was prepared in the development of the African American History and Culture Museum, looking at how those setbacks could impact the placement of the building. I'll also note that the setbacks on other frontages would also be necessary to preserve a landscape setting consistent with other museums on the National Mall. As such, the museum program and building do not appear to reasonably fit at this location, and we would recommend considering other sites. And so, while the four focus sites are the Smithsonian's current priority, which we recognize, each site brings its own set of challenges and, therefore, it's important to'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'keep other options on the table. We recognize that this is an unprecedented time. And we acknowledge that siting one, let alone two museums at the same time is a huge challenge. And so, it's certainly with a third potentially coming, that creates even more challenges. If these various site constraints are ultimately found to be insurmountable, or if jurisdiction to these sites is unable to be transferred to the Smithsonian, another approach could be considered. During this unique moment in history with, as I mentioned, three museums on the horizon, and a contraction of office space, the Smithsonian could consider opportunities on Independence Avenue which is already home to several museums, including the Castle, the Haupt Garden, and the Eisenhower Memorial to along this corridor. There are a number of possible candidate sites, but I'm going to mention just as one example this other approach focusing on potentially expanding'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'the South Mall Campus, which the Smithsonian controls, to include the Department of Energy site which is located just to the south. And this is the Forrestal Building, which many of you are familiar with. This area is part of a transforming and vibrant part of the District which includes the Wharf, which is further south here on the screen, the new Spy Museum, and Banneker Park. This site, highlighted here in blue, when cleared and repurposed, could accommodate multiple museums, each with its own distinct architectural character. This large property adjacent to the existing Smithsonian museums to the north, offers increased density and heights, the potential for sweeping views of the National Mall, and place-making opportunities not present in other Mall sites. The location also avoids the many challenges which I've discussed on the focus sites, including size constraints, impacts to view-sheds, historic preservation challenges, and the elimination of'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'recreational spaces. The consolidation of federal office space resulting from the shift to telework now suggests that the time could be now to work with the General Services Administration or Department of Energy on such an opportunity. In conclusion, the Commission has previously emphasized that we are quickly reaching a point where there will not be any available sites left on the National Mall. As such, we strongly encourage the Smithsonian to look at Independence Avenue and 10th Street as significant opportunities for multiple museums immediately adjacent to the National Mall. The Commission has also previously mentioned other sites, including the Whitten Building, Federal Triangle, and Union Station as other areas to consider. That concludes my comments on behalf of the staff. I want to acknowledge again how important and challenging this undertaking is. And we appreciate the Smithsonian's work with staff. And we will look forward to continued cooperation'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'as they move into site selection and the planning and design of these museums. And with that, that concludes my presentation. I'm available to answer any questions. And the Smithsonian team is also available as well for the discussion. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Flis. Under Secretary Cortez, Director Zamanillo, Director Sasaki, Ms. Greene, and Ms. Trowbridge, who I believe is also with us, we appreciate this presentation and hearing the update on your study. And if we have any other questions, I'd like to ask the commissioners to bring their questions forward now. Any questions for Mr. Flis or the team?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yes. I have a question.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah. What I'm really curious about, I mean, I really appreciate seeing that chart with all the different options that were, were being considered. But I have essentially two questions. The first one is, you know, in the past, and I can't remember what meeting it was, but the prospect of using the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Building that faces on 15th Street and, you know, between 15th and 14th, was raised. And at one point I thought it was going to be considered, but I don't see any indication that it has been considered. And I'm wondering if, in fact, it was and what you thought? And if it wasn't, why not? Because it is a building that, as I understand it, will be vacated before very long.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Commissioner May, if I may. Thank you for raising that. We did bring that up at the last meeting and when I talked to you previously. We did do research on that previously, and we did further research recently. I'd like to turn it over to Ann to talk a little bit about what we found and our perspective. So, Ann.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' Thank you, Ron. Commissioner May, yes, we haven't brought it forward as a Tier 1 site. We did look at it. We did discuss it with Commissioner Wright recently. And the first question is its availability, which is unknown at this point. Initially we did not include it because we were under the impression that it would continue to be occupied as a headquarters once the printing operation was relocated. What we've heard more recently from Commissioner Wright is that they are in the process of doing a very comprehensive look at all their real estate.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I have to interrupt, Ann. This, I told you then this, the building is a Treasury asset. It does not belong to GSA.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' And I, and I informed you that --'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' Sorry.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' -- I don't know anything about it really.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': 'Yeah. Okay. All of the Exec Branch agencies are looking at their assets and the population that might change based on post-pandemic increased telework and the like. So, it could be that it may be available, but unlikely until another 10 years, if that. It's an older building that would have very little opportunity to establish a museum identity, which is really important to our constituents. And there is less opportunity for new additions than other sites. The configuration, its structure, quarter spacing, and floor heights do not appear to lend themselves to re-use as a museum. It is distant from other Smithsonian museums, and is less visible from the central Mall than other sites considered, with the closest on 14th Street, that lacks walkability. The service access we are not sure will work. We understand that currently service is via the Print Annex Building. And those busy streets leading'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': 'to the 14th Street Bridge may make service for museum use difficult on that site. So, that is really where we stand. We have, I think, there are other existing buildings that probably are more attractive than that one in terms of location and site configuration and the like.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Okay. So, I'll just comment that it's a little baffling to me that there was not, you know, it didn't even appear on the map of the 27 sites, this building, when you have, you have looked at it, you have evaluated against at least some of your criteria. And it would have been helpful to have seen and heard some of that earlier on. And we do know some things about that building because we know about the replacement facility before, which is, you know, under review by NCPC and has gone through at least one, one or two reviews at this point. So, we know that it's going to be vacated before too long. And it may not hold much of a future or, if it's going to be 10 years, it may not be an alternative right now. But, certainly, it's a really good location. And it's'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'a really good building and, you know, does fit into that category of existing buildings that might be reused. And it's, you know, some of the arguments that it's not really close, I mean it's, it's right across the street from the Tidal Basin site, which is one of your focus sites. So, it's a little bit further down the street, but not that far. Anyway, so --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Well, and also, I would just, like, hasten to add I think GSA certainly has been supportive of -- we don't own it, but we've been supportive of looking at it in a displacement theory context. In other words, if another building was chosen, it could be considered another building on the Mall, let's say, or proximate to the Mall, it could then receive the, potentially, the refugees from, from a building that was reused, if selected. I just want to mark that because I don't think that, at least we were thinking about it in terms of the museum as much as potentially housing people who might be moved.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Yeah. I guess the question that we have is we're sort of trying to answer this question, I think Ann has talked about our information that we had that it would be available in approximately 10 years. So, do you have information that it would be available earlier than 10 years? Or maybe I misunderstood?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I don't recall the particulars. I just know that it's going to be vacated before too long. And, of course, we were thinking about, you know, what comes after these two, the feasibility study for the Asian and Pacific Islanders Museum is, you know, I mean, it took 10 years for the Museum of the American Latino to get from the feasibility stage to the authorization.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Yeah.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So, talking that far into the future is only sensible.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Yeah. I think that's a good point. While it may not work for these two, I think our intent, I think from the beginning as we had talked about, putting together this report that could be used for the next museum as well. So, it's good information. And I think that's a point well taken, Commissioner May, that we'll include that as part of our analysis.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, thank you. I mean, I do, I do think it's -- you've done, it seems like you've done the analysis. It seems to be worthy of being included in the charts and for this to be taken as availability.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' I agree. Yeah, I agree with you, and I think that's good feedback. We will include that.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So, the next question I have is that, I mean, there wasn't really an explicit mention of the concerns that have been raised by the National Park Service in our site meeting and in the virtual meeting that we held about the two sites within the Reserve, having to do with operational security considerations. Mr. Flis, you made, you know, some mention of some of those concerns. But I think we gave, you know, we gave great detailed information about that. And I'm wondering if that has been explicitly taken into consideration in developing that ranking chart that you showed us?'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' The information -- first of all, thank you, I think that we did have a very good meeting with the National Park Service and to discuss both the South Monument site and the Tidal Basin site. I think there was a lot of good information shared back to us. And we did convey that information, actually, to the Board, to all the Smithsonian staff, including to both the committees, the American Latino Committee and the Women's History Museum Council for their incorporation as they were moving forward. If you would like, I can turn this over to Lisa and Jorge who can give you a little bit of assurance that that actually did occur. So, Lisa or Jorge, would you like to respond?'",
        "'MS. SASAKI': ' Sure. I'll just jump in and say that, yes indeed, for both Council of the American Women's History Museum as well, as I know Jorge will attest, for the National Museum of the American Latinos Board, that all of the information has been given over to those bodies to consider it as part of their recommendation. So, they are taking those, those bits of feedback very seriously in considering all of the sites there. Jorge, did you have anything to add?'",
        "'MR. ZAMANILLO': ' No. Yeah, we had a board meeting this past Monday and we had all the information as they formulate their opinion on sites, locus for everything. But thank you.'",
        "'MS. SASAKI': ' Okay.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' If I can just state, it seems, I just want to make sure that it really is fully considered, because I think there are some pretty serious constraints on those two sites that were brought up in those discussions. And these are, this is just, you know, this is beyond the Reserve prohibition and everything. But these are important operational considerations that can affect not just the Park Service's operations but the Smithsonian's operations. So, it's important for the committees to be considering how, it's also important for the Board of Regents to take this into consideration as they evaluate sites. So, I hope that all that information is thoroughly communicated to that board.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' Commissioner May, I can say that that is being included in our report to our regents already.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Okay, thank you.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' It's just in preparation. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Thank you very much. Very good questions, thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' That's it for my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Do other commissioners have questions?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' I do.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner Cozart.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'Hi. And thank you for the presentation and sharing a little bit more background. Mr. Flis in his presentation really kind of laid out a case for the Forrestal Building. And I just want to comment that that is a really exciting proposition from the District's perspective, given that there's sets of plans that we engaged NCPC in almost a decade ago -- we've been talking about decades and how you need to take time to, to think through these things -- but almost a decade ago really re-envisioning 10th Street as important connection to the Mall, and then also to our waterfront. As you know, we spent many decades trying to make significant reinvestment in our waterfront. And that does include really thinking about 10th Street as an extension up into the core of the city and the core of Downtown. And so, the idea of three new museums'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'on 10th Street, especially ones that can be iconic architecture, that are representative of the focus of those museums, is very exciting and very aligned with economic rejuvenation that we want to see in the District. And they also, it feels like there's alignment because they also happen to be in the good ranking within, within the criteria that you found. And so, I'm wondering if you could just say a little bit about the thinking that you have related to that as a possibility? What are the considerations that you have in mind? Do you see a way that that could go up in the rankings, especially based on things like museum identity that can be a part of that?'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Commissioner Cozart, those are -- it's great feedback. I think that, you know, in the past we just asked about the overall strong desire of the both committees to be located on the Mall. I think one of the questions that's been posed to us in the past: have we eliminated other sites? And I think we've made that clear we have not eliminated other sites but that we're focusing on these four sites which we hope to achieve. But we also have done research on the, on the sites, the Forrestal Building, and both Orville and Wilbur as well. So, we understand those sites and their strength and limitations in great detail, as well as the additional costs. So, I would just say we're focused on these four, but we're also very aware that there's a great deal of study on these sites on Independence as well.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' If I could just do a follow-up. I appreciate that. I think that there's been some considerable challenges introduced by commissioners, as a part of NCPC, and I'm wondering if they're starting to think differently about weighting any criteria and that kind of thing. I'm curious about that. And I guess I'll also just comment that the opportunity to kind of have those view-sheds to the Smithsonian Castle in some ways creates that connection, that visual connection and park connection that people will have through that visitation. So, just my follow-up is are you, are you starting to think differently about kind of weighting criteria as it relates to some of the feedback that you've gotten from the Commission and the NCPC staff?'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' I think I would answer that in two parts. The overwhelming desire of the committees is to be on the Mall. Although the importance of these meetings is to make sure that we're receiving feedback and, you know, taking advantage of that feedback and incorporating it into our process. So, I would just stay there -- stop there.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Thank you for that response.'",
        "'MS. TROWBRIDGE': ' I want to add, Commissioner Cozart, that this, among the existing building potentials, this is one that would be a very long way out in the future, given it's a major cabinet department that would need to find a new location. It would have a complexity of redevelopment to reinstate the Virginia Avenue access, et cetera. So, it, it's probably the longest wait for a museum, and the most costly to develop for a museum. I agree that the result could be fabulous.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner Cozart (audio interference).'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' Any other questions?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Did the Chair freeze?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, I think the Chairman is frozen.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' The Chair's Zoom freezed.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yes. Is the Vice Chair available to pick up the reins here? Oh, she's back.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': ' I don't know what happened. You just went away entirely. I apologize. I was lost in Zoom. And I was asking Commissioner Cozart if she has any further questions.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' I don't have any further questions.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' I'm so sorry for that. Thank you. Any other questions from other commissioners before we go to discussion? All right. I don't see or hear any. At this time let's open it up for discussion. And ask everyone to turn on your cameras. And please keep them on during discussion. I will start with Commissioner Wright and then go in a round robin format using the normal seating order. So, Commissioner Wright.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Well, I can't, I can't put it any other way than to say that it is disheartening to hear pretty much the same presentation over and over again. And, and I think there's been a lot of valuable feedback that would suggest alternatives are really worth looking at. And the continued focus and the continued insistence that these are the four, these are the four, these are the four, in the face of very viable alternatives, and good reasons to eliminate, for example, the Tidal Basin site, is disheartening. I think we are at a particularly historic moment where the convergence of three things, without talking about specifics, specific locations. I want to before I get to those three things I think one of the things that really strikes me is that there has been a lot of, a lot of planning work that, as Commissioner Cozart mentioned, a decade's'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'worth of planning work. I don't even remember what year it was that we started working on. I was a member of the 10th Street Task Force. And at the time, we were looking at Banneker. And I was a big advocate for saying at the time, well, shoot, people are not going to walk down this dreary street to get to Banneker Overlook because there's no there there, there's no reason to go down there. And I was quite skeptical about this whole idea of creating, you know, releasing like a pressure valve on the Mall by thinking about this. And then when we started getting into it, eventually the 10th Street Task Force planning exercises morphed into the Ecodistrict. And so, we've been looking at this area of town for at least the 13 years that I've been back in Washington. And it just feels a little bit'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'like we're ignoring all of this work that's been done, anticipating this moment when -- and it's true, we're not quite there, but the primacy of location on the Mall is not -- fails to think forward enough. We are planners. Planners don't think in terms of what's immediately in front of us, but rather our job is to engage the imagination and to engage in well beyond. That's why it's sometimes frustrating. It's, it's quite abstract sometimes. And we have three, three museums who are right in front of us. The Mall, of course, everybody wants to be on the Mall. And I've said this before. We hear it at NCMAC with every memorial sponsor there is, and museums, too. Of course, everybody wants a front row seat. And I appreciate that. But the Mall is a finite resource. And if we don't plan for its, it's -- not'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'expiration. What's the word I'm looking for? -- if we don't plan for that moment when it really is, like, full-up, there is no rule we can break, there is no rule we -- law we can change, there is no planning principle we can bend, there just ain't no more land, period. And that time is rapidly approaching. And we have three museums on the books to plan for. So, and this is, so the Mall, the scarcity of real estate on the Mall, coupled with what will, we believe will be a historic contraction of the federal portfolio, and climate change, and all of the environmental emergencies that are facing us, it seems all of these things seem to converge into, you know, reuse or reimagining a federal asset, the Arts and Industries Building being one of them. But, and I want to also underscore what, a point'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'that Mr. May made last time about the consideration of these, of these undeveloped sites as being vacant instead of undeveloped with a purpose. I mean, the Tidal Basin site being the prime one to me, which seems inviolate. It's in every planning document going back to the L'Enfant Plan, through McMillan and everyone in between. That, that view-shed of the 15th Street access of the L'Enfant Plan has been sacrosanct. And I don't, I can't imagine why we would be looking deeply into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 that. And then, by the same token, the Bureau of Printing and Engraving is too far away from the campus? I, it's just, the logic of it doesn't hold up for me. But, but in any event, those three things -- the scarcity of'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'land, available land, as desirable -- and I completely understand the primacy that the, that the two museums place on a Mall position, but as Commissioner Cozart eloquently put it, there there's an opportunity to release some of the pressure that is now coming to bear on the Mall, and will certainly get worse as time goes on, well beyond our time here. There will be, there will be other organizations who want representation on the Mall. And the 10th Street access is an opportunity that, that is right in front of us. And there are, and there are meaningful urban connections that we have plans for, that we imagined and have happened. I mean, there is a destination. It's more than a half -- not half-baked, that's not true -- but it wasn't quite designed at the time we imagined it, I don't think, the Banneker Overlook, or it'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'has Park Service, it has been -- it's seen better days. It certainly wasn't a destination. The Wharf is a destination. And making these meaningful connections in the urban fabric of the city is also a responsibility, I think, of the federal government and the Smithsonian as part of that landholder, major landholder in the city. So, I would urge that we have another look. Because I think the context in which we are operating in 2022, it's true, it's going to be a long-term prospect, whatever site is chosen. But I don't think -- I think that the presumption that moving a federal agency is a gargantuan task that will drag us down through a decade is not knowable. And the massive movements that are going to be taking place over the next, I don't know how long it will take, but I would point you to also the'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'December date that OMB has given the agencies to come back to them with plans for their housing strategies based on what they know of \"post-pandemic\" employee behavior, and what will -- what kind of contraction are we talking about? We don't know yet how much square footage will be rescinded, but we do know that people are, are giving up a lot of space already. And we expect that to be more knowable in December. I also know that you have a December '22 deadline from Congress. But it could -- one, one of the things that might be bent is asking for an extension. So, I would, again, I think we -- GSA urges, because of the three factors that are converging, we urge you to have a look and be open-minded in considering some of the other sites that have been suggested. We don't have, we don't'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'have, I was going to say a dog in this fight. I suppose we do. The assets, we have assets. Your list, your list of 27 was, was filled with GSA assets. We're not pulling for one versus another, we're simply saying these three ideas need to shape the thinking, we believe, because of this historic opportunity to reimagine the federal government's portfolio. And the Smithsonian could take advantage of that.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Commissioner Dixon. Let me move on to Commissioner Cozart.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'I, I do again want to thank the staff for what is a really complex endeavor. And really appreciate how you've put these pieces together. And really thank the Smithsonian team for really sharing with us the thinking that you have and the way you're proceeding through this. I just, again, want to underscore opportunities that exist, thinking about that, that 10th Street corridor. And the reality, as Commissioner Wright so aptly put, of the real changes to the federal workplace, and where it's going to be, and who's going to be there, and who's going to show up on a Monday through Friday basis. And also thinking about who will be around. We've seen a coming back of many visitors to the District. And we, our projections say that that is going to continue, and they're going to be and want to be in places, spend their time and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'stay in places that are vibrant. And these museums are certainly part of that. So, just want to encourage you to kind of think about those other sites. And appreciate you all coming back to us to, to talk about where some of your analysis is taking you. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you so much. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'So, I'm glad not to have to go first because, you know, whatever I would want to say has been said. So, I appreciate that, Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Cozart. I will also, but I do have a few things to say myself. So, first of all I want to emphasize the complete support of the National Park Service and the Department of the Interior for the establishment of these museums. I mean, these are important stories to tell, and important venues that be created. And we agree that they should be as prominent as possible. But the challenge is not everybody can have their space on the Mall when the Mall is a finite resource, as Commissioner Wright said. So, I mean, that's actually the crux of the challenge. I will say, also, that it's very interesting to see that chart that gave sort of a ranking of the sites'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'and that it went beyond the four, so we understand what's beyond the four. I think that was really, really helpful. I may want to quibble with some of the scoring, but I can't say I really understand that well. But I think it's still good to see the range of sites that are being considered, and seeing how closely packed sort of the, you know, the second row is, or the second batch. I think there's a whole bunch of opportunities there, including some that involve, you know, taking over sites of federal office buildings that are pretty highly ranked there. So, I think that's, that was a very helpful thing to see. And I think that is the one thing that is new from what we have seen before, because so much of what we saw today was things that I think we heard before in one context'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'or another. I will say that, you know, we remain concerned about sites within the Reserve being considered, both because of the legal prohibition, but also because of the points made by Mr. Flis and, of course, Commissioner Wright, about the north-south cross axis, the importance of the north-south view-shed, the importance of the great cross axis to the Mall. I mean, that's the purpose behind the Reserve. And that is something that the Congress has already said in the Commemorative Works Act that they want it preserved. And they reiterated it in the authorization for these museums by saying that those things could not be selected. So, I mean and it does, I understand that it's a bit of a, of a challenge, but there will be many challenging aspects to this process. I also just want to state again the reminder that the -- that because the agency'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'that holds the land for any one of these sites that would be sought by the Board of Regents have to explicitly give approval of it, that that triggers a need to action for us. So, you know, if you were to say tomorrow that you love Banneker even, and we supported that -- we would support that, I think -- that even that would require need for compliance, and that could slow down any kind of production of an affirmative consent to the use of that site. So, you know, we've said this before, and I just feel it's one I have to, I have to repeat it, I do also want to touch on the operational concerns and the security concerns raised in our meetings with the Smithsonian on site. The, you know, both of the Reserve sites, our sites that are constrained by roads, and very busy'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'roads, and very highly-trafficked roads, for things like road races and motor kings, and things like that. So there are all sorts of closures that could be happening at these sites that wouldn't necessarily be happening at, say, the Arts and Industries Building. It's also worth noting that in the Tidal Basin especially that it's a highly-trafficked area. I mean, there's really only one road that it faces on, which is 15th Street, because Independence Avenue and Maine Avenue, which are the other flanks, are so busy they are not, this is not like stepping out of museum, out of a museum and going on to Jefferson and Madison Drive. And even when we were there for our site visit we saw many people jay-walking across the middle of 14th Street going to the Holocaust Museum from where they're dropped off on the west side of 15th. And so, I'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'think there are huge considerations having to do with just, just visitor safety because of that location. 15th Street as the flank for a museum is very challenging when, especially when there's a museum right across the street. Then there are all the other operational concerns having to do with security and staging. You know, the Tidal Basin site is used as a staging area for many, many large events. And we expect the number of events to go up in the future. And so it's, it's only going to get more complicated just from an operational concern. And, again, these are constraints not just on our operations but also on the future operation of these museums, and they should be taken very seriously. And I do want to just say I think, you know, the analysis by the staff of the four focus sites was on target and I'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'think, you know, expressed very concisely what the concerns are about each of those sites. And I really appreciate Mr. Flis for going through all that. And I also appreciate the fact that, you know, the NCPC is attempting to be visionary about this and attempting to think more broadly about where museums could be located. Because I do think, as Commissioner Wright said, as Commissioner Cozart said, Mr. Flis said, you know, we have to plan with imagination, we have to think more broadly about these things. And it's, wow, wouldn't it be great to, to really solve this problem instead of trying to, you know, squeeze out the last few inches of Mall for the sake of one museum or another. Again, this is not to say that we do not support the establishment of museums or a prominent location. We, we do support that. But I think'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'it's important that a prominent location is not just what you are working here with today, bit is what you are imagining in the future. This is what, this is what led to the L'Enfant Plan and the McMillan Plan, this kind of broader planning thinking. So I, I strongly, strongly encourage it. And so, that's it for me. Thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Commissioner Argo, any comments? You are our final commissioner to speak today.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': 'Yes. I will, I mean, really that given that, let me just say -- I want to say it appropriately -- the comprehensive, and pointed, and thoughtful, and educated comments from both Commissioner Wright and Commissioner May make it easy for me to basically align with them and support. I mean, I essentially support those comments. I think this is a -- and particularly the notion of being really urging the, you know, the community that will have to come to the Capital Planning Commission at some point, and those that are in the process of seeking feedback and -- from the Planning Commission to think creatively and to think beyond the kind of parameters that I think that we're used to seeing in Washington about what's the, you know, what's the most valuable, what's the most important space. So, I appreciate all that. I have nothing to add beyond'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': 'that. Thank you.'",

        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'I thought that was the final one. I just wanted to thank, if I can have an opportunity thank everyone for all of their comments that have come in. And, hopefully, we've been open about receiving them and conveying them to our leadership team and all of our stakeholders. And we really appreciate the thoughtfulness that those comments were presented today, especially the staff presentation by Matthew Flis. I thought that was very helpful. And it's really, I think I said it at the very beginning, is that the challenge that we face, of course, is there's no perfect site. There's no site that has all of the square footage, and all of the -- and in the location that we would like to be. And I know that there has been in a discussion on the Forrestal site that even that, you know, some of the challenges we didn't'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'go into today because that's not really one of our four focus sites. But it does have the challenges in the fact that it's occupied. It's over a million square feet. We did do cost estimates on that, that it would cost, all of our four focus options it would cost an incremental cost of over $1.2 billion. And that's not including needing an additional site or moving off. So, but we do appreciate all of the comments. And on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution we will take these and definitely make them part of our process as we move forward. I appreciate everything that has been said and the time that's been taken to visit the sites as well. Thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Under Secretary Cortez. You have a, you and your team have a gargantuan task on your hands. And we really appreciate the coordination between your staff and our staff over this past year. I believe we've received four briefings now from the Smithsonian staff and consultant team. And we appreciate how they've worked so closely with our staff to provide information and answers questions during this important process. Again, we acknowledge the magnitude and the complexity of this undertaking, and appreciate the collaboration. And it, it's very clear to us that the people who are so passionate about these museums have a strong desire to locate on the actual Mall. And the significance this brings is a very high priority for the -- for both of the museums. Understand that the importance of representation on the Mall is something that needs to be considered, since the Mall is'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'a place where we commemorate as a nation and we want to make sure that stories are told in an equitable way. So, we understand the balance that everyone is trying to seek. And these sites are also going to be challenging, as we hear today. And from a planning and design perspective, the Arts and Industries Building and the Northwest Capitol site seem to be the most viable. And I don't think anyone could dispute the prominence and visibility of their locations on the Mall. So, I want to underscore what was said in the staff's presentation just as we end this conversation, that if the various site constraints are ultimately found to be insurmounta -- unsur --insurmountable, excuse me, or if the underlying jurisdiction cannot be transferred to the Smithsonian, we recommend considering another approach. And as Mr. Flis said, this is a unique moment in history with'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'three museums on the horizon, an unprecedented contraction of office space. The Smithsonian should continue to consider opportunities on Independence Avenue, which is already home to several museums, in addition to the Smithsonian Castle, and Haupt Garden, and Eisenhower Memorial. And I also want to echo the comments of my fellow commissioners, and Commissioner Cozart's comments about 10th Street and how important it is to think, think toward the future as we're trying to resolve this. And in terms of next steps, I will work with our staff to finalize the formal comment letter from NCPC. It will come from me to the Smithsonian. And we will keep the Commission's discussion today in mind as that letter is created. And we will get back to you with our formal comments. But, again, I really appreciate the time and effort that's gone into this process. So, are there any further comments'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'or questions that any of our commissioners want to make today? If not --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, I do. I just, I want to come back --'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Oops.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': '-- because it always feels, well I imagine it feels a little bit like getting, you get beat up a little bit. But the Commissioner May's message, I think everyone, well it's, it's hard to argue with the importance of either one of these organizations, or the third one to come, the next one in the queue. And so, when we say to the Smithsonian, you know, we get that everybody wants to be on the Mall -- we really do. I mean, people, memorial sponsors, it is not uncommon for memorial sponsors to come into the advisory, the NCMAC, Memorial Advisory Commission, and cry, literally, in front of us. They're so, they're so -- the prospect of not getting a Mall location reduces memorial sponsors to tears. And that is not an exaggeration.

And the possibility, you know, the Forrestal possibility, I'm agnostic on the specifics. I'm just urging that the thought to take this opportunity with three organi -- three museums in front of us to expand the Mall in a thoughtful, deliberate way that has actually been studied for quite some time is one that perhaps deserves further deliberation.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Again, our thanks to the Smithsonian for listening and working with us as we try to resolve this issue and really prepare ourselves for the future. There will be more museums who will come our way. And I think the work that you're doing is really the groundwork that's necessary to consider where those museums will go. Neal R. Gross and Co., Inc.

Our next regular commission 7 meeting will be on Thursday, October 6th, 2022, at 8 1:00 p.m. 9 If there's no other business, this 10 session is now adjourned. 11'",
