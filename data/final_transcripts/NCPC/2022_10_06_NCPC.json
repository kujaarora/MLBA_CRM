And it's sad that we won't have that moment. And I want to make sure, I don't know that she is listening to this, but I want to make sure that she knows that she will be certainly missed. I don't know, we've gotten along, I guess, for a couple of years without her. But, and you know, nothing like being greeted by Patricia when you come in. So, sorry to see her go. But again, well-deserved retirement.'",

The District Department of Transportation has submitted final site development plans for the 11th Street Bridge Park for your review and approval. You may recall that the preliminary site development plans came before you in April of 2020. As a reminder, the park will be located in Southeast Washington, D.C., immediately south of the Navy Yard and just north of Anacostia Park and historic Anacostia. The project seeks to reuse the existing piers from the old 11th Street Bridge crossing at the Anacostia River to create a unique destination and park that connects surrounding communities. The Commission approved the preliminary and final site design for the replacement of the old 11th Street Bridge in 20 11. That project replaced the 40-year-old pair of bridges across the Anacostia'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'River to provide and sustain these enhancements for a new 11th Street local bridge, and Interstate 695 bridge. The old 11th Street bridge piers remained, and with additional new piers, will be used as the base for the proposed park. The proposed Bridge Park required extensive coordination with the U.S. Navy and the National Park Service for access and land. The transfer of jurisdiction for the land necessary south of the river from the National Park Service to the District, was approved by the Commission in December 2020. The 11th Street Bridge Park has four goals, creating a healthy community by establishing a safe place for residents to exercise and play, connecting the community with the Anacostia River, reconnecting the neighborhoods of Anacostia, Fairlawn and Capitol Hill, and Navy Yard, and generating new jobs and economic vitality. The project team has had roughly one thousand meetings involving the community and'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'various government and local agencies throughout the design process. The proposed Bridge Park intends to connect two historically disparate sides of the river with a series of outdoor program spaces and active zones that will provide an engaging place connected to the Anacostia River. Final design maintains the original concept. It includes 1.2 acres of trail and landscape area on the Navy Yard side, a hammock area and picnic garden, a central plaza, a caf and community porch, a children's play area, an environmental education center, and two overlooks. The south side of the Bridge Park includes an amphitheater, and a kayak and canoe launch, adjacent to the existing Anacostia Riverwalk Trail.

The Applicant has worked extensively to improve the access plan to address previous comments by the Commission. This plan shows accessory access to and through the bridge. The area also contains an improved connection to the Riverwalk Trail. Here is a rendered view of the Bridge Park. I'll briefly walk through each of the main elements of the proposed Bridge Park, starting on the north side. These are views of the approach to the Bridge Park from the Navy Yard entrance at O Street. This includes a connection to the River Trail on the north side of the river. This is a view of the Bridge Park entry as you enter from the Navy Yard. The central path leads to the landscape area of rain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13'",

The Applicant has stated that local artists will be commissioned to design individual hammocks inspired by local community heros. The central plaza is where the approach from the north connects with great lawn and the overlooks. This is a key point of view shed on the bridge, and provides a large viewing area at a higher elevation than the existing 11th Street Bridge Overlooks. Using the outside path from the central plaza, visitors can access the Capitol Overlook at the north end of the bridge. The Commission had previously requested the Applicant further coordinate with the Department of the Navy regarding any security impacts of the project to the Washington Navy Yard. The design team met with the Navy, and revised several design components, including adding glass to the overlook to address'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'the Navy's concerns. Adjacent to the central plaza is the great lawn that will function as a green roof, and will provide additional space for passive recreation, educational opportunities, and active programing. The southern end of the Bridge Park roof is the Anacostia Overlook. This overlook is wider, and will allow for more people to view Anacostia Park and historic Anacostia. On the bridge deck, below the great lawn and the Anacostia Overlook, is the caf and community porch. The caf will provide food, beverages, and shelter from the elements for park visitors. Additionally, the community room will be made available for local stakeholders for meetings by local -- for meetings by local ANCs, civic associations, and nonprofits. The proposed caf materials will include a wood deck and concrete pavers, galvanized steel frames and cladding, fiberglass reinforced plastic, over fiber cement, galvanized steel graded handrails, and extensive glazing. These materials'",

Continuing south on the bridge deck is the children's play area. The play area's theme is mussel beach, and will highlight native mollusks in the Anacostia River and the important role the play in improving water quality and providing aquatic habitat. Next to the play area is the Environment Education Center or EEC. The EEC is intended to engage the public with the river, and educate them on the local environment. Many of the other facilities and programming included in the Bridge Park and rely on the Anacostia River are intended to increase engagement with the EEC. The center will be run by the Anacostia Watershed Society, whose mission is to protect and restore the Anacostia River. It is a two-story structure that will include classrooms,'",

The southern portion of the park includes new features, including an outdoor amphitheater and a kayak launch on the river. The proposed amphitheater depicted here was relocated from below the northern end of the bridge deck. The Applicant indicated the original location was problematic, given the size and potential for noise and interference from the adjacent 11th Street local and Interstate 695 bridges. The new location of the amphitheater is proposed in the location of a previously proposed water spray feature. It will be built into the existing topography of the landscape, with a view overlooking the river. The performing arts in the amphitheater will be a catalyst for bringing people together to amplify local voices. The kayak and canoe launch will provide access to the water'",

The 11th Street Bridge Park is a layered landscape that brings people together with the environment, and acts as an ambassador for stewardship of the Anacostia River. Each area of the Bridge Park has an educational component that speaks to the restoration and outreach work of the Anacostia Watershed. The Applicant has committed to an overall planting palate that is predominantly native plants that perform well in the local eco region. Only a few selections are adapted plant species based on microclimates and cultural limitations. The Commission has received comments from Mr. Berne, with suggested plant palate changes to support the Monarch butterfly. The Applicant has indicated support for these changes. The Applicant has updated the fencing and guardrail design to meet several'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'goals, including aesthetics, implementation, and anti- spillability. The Applicant is proposing a metal material with a two by two grating for the fencing, and a three by three grating for the guardrails because it is not climbable. It is also consistent with the building facade materials. And specific too here, the guardrails are used in and around the parameter of the Bridge Park, and anywhere else they are needed. The fencing will only be used at the top of the central utility building. The steel grating design used on the guardrails has larger openings to minimize the disruption to the view of the bridge. The design also incorporates lighting into the handrail of the guardrail. Here's another rendered view showing the guardrails. The project is required to meet local stormwater management requirements. And has been coordinated extensively with the District Department of Energy and Environment. The project is proposing to'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'meet stormwater with a variety of best management practices noted here. Many of these elements are also intended as educational as well. There are ongoing discussions between the District Department of Energy and Environment and the Applicant regarding the mitigation measures necessary to address the proposed changes to wetlands and pier dredging. If design changes are required as a result of this coordination, the Applicant should -- the project should be resubmitted to the Commission for review. Therefore, staff recommends the Commission request the Applicant continue to work the District Department of Energy and Environment to address any outstanding issues. The Commission previously requested additional information on the proposed lighting plan to ensure that it would negatively impact the natural setting of the bridge. The proposed bridge lighting includes a combination of general purpose lighting for access and safety, lighting for activity areas, and architectural bridge lighting. The proposed lighting'",

As such, lighting levels will be appropriate to meet the design needs and minimum safety standards, while minimizing access light, as well as upward and horizontal spillage. For the crisscrossing bridge deck, the Applicant is proposing a continuous linear LED luminaire be mounted to the bottom of the bridge deck on the upper and lower levels to light a portion of the structure emphasizing the bridge form. Low light bollards with a shielded light source will light the horizontal surface along open paths. The design intent is to avoid light pools in open paths. Ambient lighting will be provided by recessed in-ground paver luminaries utilizing LED light sources. The way-finding package identifies a sign hierarchy and sign family that delivers a cohesive, intuitive, and accessible way-finding system'",

But, thank you to the Commission and to the NCPC staff for pulling this together. The goal of the 11th Street Bridge Park is to transform this aged-out piece of infrastructure to extend the life of it, of the original federal investment, while creating a new civic space that supports the community's environmental, economic, cultural, and physical health, while reconnecting two long divided neighborhoods that have been separated not only by the Anacostia River, but two freeways. This project'",

And while not the topic of this discussion today, something to note that the communities also supported and created a series of equitable development strategies to ensure that local residents can stay and thrive in place. Get ahead of it on any issues of gentrification displacement. To date, we've been able to invest about, a little more than $85 million in the nearby neighborhood with affordable housing, workforce development, preservation of black owned businesses, and arts and culture strategies.

And I'm very -- we're all excited about what he's done. It's a great concept. He knows that I've always been a little concerned about putting more resources on the ground that we have there at the park then building a new structure. But, he's done it. And he's put it together. And it's going to be very, very nice. And I congratulate him and all those who have been associated with it.

We are currently working with a memorandum from the City, between our nonprofit, Building Bridges Across the River that runs the ARC. We run a network of seven urban farms and the Skyline Workforce Center, to run and manage the park. So, Building Bridges Across the River will have a 99-year lease or permit. We're still working out the exact, the legal mechanism to run the park. But, the idea is that the City, the District Department of Transportation will be responsible for the infrastructure, the piers, the pilings, right, bridges need to be inspected on a regular basis, the City will fold that into their regular inspections. And then we, Building Bridges Across the River, will run everything from'",

They have 31 years of working to restore the health of the Anacostia River. And in addition, we'll continue our -- we will program the amphitheater center, Anacostia plaza, and the community front porch. But, just like we program our theater and blackbox series to the river, working very closely with nearby residents and nonprofits to ensure that there is a sliding scale on these. So, at no cost on the, or little cost to local residents to use that space. Did that answer your question, Commissioner Dixon? (No response.)'",

The question I had, you spoke in your remarks, Scott, about kind of the pieces related to the equitable development initiative. And I'm curious if there are ways that we might be able to see something that's more of an initiative, of a program that you see, you know, in people. Is there any way that you've explored how to manifest that in this space at all?'",
        "'MR. KRATZ': 'Yes. Wonderful question, Commissioner Cozart. Thank you. Our first version of the equitable development plan, as you might know, focused on affordable housing, workforce development, and small businesses. The -- we realized that we left out arts and culture, which is equally as important, to really elevate that, amplifying that to local residents on the same level as those economic factors. And so several years ago, back in 2019, we worked with arts and cultural leaders on the -- to create equitable development strategies around arts and culture. And many of those, if not most of those, manifest on the park itself. And I'll give you just two examples. We recently, earlier this year, or actually the beginning of last year, we initiated, we worked with arts and cultural leaders to commission major art works for the park. Much of this work has been, how do we put that decision-making'",
        "'MR. KRATZ': 'ability, decision-making power back in the hands of local residents? So, we created a curatorial committee comprised of local residents, stakeholders, arts agencies, arts organizations, to select four major pieces of art for the park. We'll be happy to send those examples to everybody. I'm happy to say that they're all artists in the DMV. Interestingly, they're all women. That includes a giant mural, a lighted art piece, a major art commission by a mother/daughter D.C.-based duo, named Jackson Jarvis Studios, who did the art work around the Anacostia Metro Station, whose giant, 11 giant metal circles called the Anacostia Sunrise/Sunset Portals, that really becomes the anchor east of the river. And one of the art interventions that we're really excited about is a mobile small business kiosk that will exist on the park, the --featuring black entrepreneurs from east of the river. So, if we're attracting a million people'",
        "'MR. KRATZ': 'a year, 800,000 to 1.2 million visitors, I believe, is the best estimate, we want to make sure as much as we can, that those dollars are going back into the hands of local residents. Lastly, to test and pilot those, we're actually building the small business kiosk this year. It will debut at next year's River Festival, with the larger idea to really test and pilot to see what works. But more importantly, building a pipeline to black entrepreneurs east of the river so that when the park opens, you know, we'll have this sort of deep bench of the small businesses, black-owned small businesses east of the river that can really leverage the park for their economic benefit.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' As always, he did a thorough job. Again, I just wish him the best. And we'll move on and see how it goes. I'm looking forward to it.'",
        "'MR. KRATZ': ' Good. Shovels in the ground, Commissioner Dixon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Good.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thanks Commissioner. We do have one person signed up to speak. Our first speaker is Bernard Berne. Mr. Berne, you will have three minutes to provide your testimony. Welcome.'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'Thank you. I am pleased to learn that the Applicant has agreed to change the -- to implement the changes in the plant palate that I suggested in my written statement. The plant palate for the project needed several changes to improve its function and to protect the environment. Please consult my written statement for further information about the subject. The project will have three plant mixes containing perennials and ground covers, full sun meadow mix, bio-retention mix, and shade and meadow mix. The first two mixes contain soil protection and milkweed. The third contain mill root weed. None of these mixes were optimal. The Monarch butterfly populations are poorly throughout the United States. Monarch caterpillars feed only on milkweed. All three mix -- milkweed mixes should therefore contain milkweeds that are appropriate in all locations. I suggested the following changes to the mixes. Full mix, the sun meadow mix,'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'remove wrong milkweed and butterfly weed. Monitor for Monarch eggs on these milkweeds. Replace season with common milkweed which thrives in sunny areas. Monarchs prefer to lay eggs on common milkweed. Bio-retention mix, replace bio- retention milkweed with stock milkweed. Bio- retention areas collect stormwater. Plants in these areas thrive in moist conditions. Swamp milkweed grows best in these locations. Monarchs prefer to lay eggs on swamp milkweed more than they do on common milkweed. Shaded meadow mix. This mix lacks milkweed. I therefore suggest that the Applicant add milkweed to the mix. This milkweed thrives in fully and partially shaded areas such as woodlands and edges. Monarchs prefer to lay eggs on this plant. The Executive Director supports, stated that the Applicant noted that plans containing this plant are currently not available. I went around and found two nurseries that now ship those plants. I have a report informing'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'the Applicant of these. More nurseries will ship these plants in the spring, when people usually plant milkweeds. Non-native species. Remove the -- of the six non-native plants that my written statement identifies. The park intends to teach the native ecology of the Anacostia River and its surroundings. However, those plants are native to the Midwest and its prairies. They are not native to the national capital planning area. They need a permutation to be planted here. That would teach the wrong lesson. Wind pollinated grasses and sedges. Plant only small numbers of wind pollinated grasses and sedges that my written statement identifies. These plants feed few native butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. Many of these grasses are falling in the national capital region. The region's development has destroyed much of their habitat. The Applicant did not provide plant palates for some other parts of the project. I ask the'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'Applicant to consider my suggestions when developing these plant palates for these other parts of the project. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Berne. We really appreciate your perspective on this. And glad to see you again today. Does the Commission have any questions? I understand Scott, that these have been taken under advisement? Maybe I should just ask you if you'd like to respond?'",
        "'MR. KRATZ': ' Yes. Thank you, Mr. Berne for these suggestions. We do have representatives from our landscape architecture team of Olin, both Hallie Boyce and Darrell Campana are here and can probably speak about this in more expertise than I. Hallie? Or Darrell? Oh, there you are.'",
        "'MS. BOYCE': ' Good afternoon, Chairman White and Commissioners. I'm Hallie Boyce, Design Partner at Olin. I'm joined today by Associate Darrell Campana and our Living System Specialist, Judy Venonsky. I will turn this over to her in a moment. We want to thank Mr. Berne for his expertise and suggestions on the plant palate. We have taken his suggestions under advisement and have made the changes to the planting plans accordingly. We really appreciate his input and the desire to promote the ecological health of this landscape further, and address in particular the habitat for the Monarch butterfly. I would like to have Judy make a few statements if possible, if she's able to access the call at the moment.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': ' Yes. Can you hear me, Hollie?'",
        "'MS. BOYCE': ' Yes.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': ' Okay. Panel, thank you. I actually do have a matrix of the plants that are now -- we have taken all into consideration, the comments of Mr. Berne. And appreciate his wisdom. I have a matrix of the plants that now exist and I can share that matrix with the group. It very simply highlights the pollinator value of the plants that are currently in the mix, as well as identifying the butterfly weed, milkweed that exists in all three different categories now. Should I share my screen?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' I think you could, if we have a moment to do that. If not, you could certainly send that to us, and we'll make sure everyone gets a copy.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': ' Okay. I can bring it up very quickly.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Oh, there you are.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': ' Yes. Can you see the -- can you see this?'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': 'Okay. So, I think this should help Mr. Berne hopefully. These different sedges, grasses, and flowering spores are part of our mixes. I've gone to the USDA website that identifies whether they work with pollinators and what values of habitats and pollinator values are very high. Most of these are very high. Everything in green is a native grass or sedge that is from the Anacostia area. And all of these orange are the milkweeds that were suggested specifically for the areas that Mr. Berne has identified. So, I just go through this. As you can see, we have over 50 different perennial plants within our matrix of groundcover plants that are all native, with very high habitat and pollinator value. Also would also say that I think they are also quite attractive plants. They -- these were selected in many cases for ease of management, besides their ecological value.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': 'Their aesthetic value as well as their ease of management, whether that was in an area that we wanted the plant to spread out and take over an area. Or whether that was something that we wanted to maintain. And we took into consideration would the pollinating factors as well. So, none of the non-native grasses exist in this palate to date.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Well, thank you so much for such a thorough response. And thank you, Mr. Berne. It seems a very small, delicate thing to think about a butterfly and how much it impacts our environment. And I appreciate the design team really taking to heart the recommendations and the inclusion of the species that you had identified. And I see you had your hand up, Mr. Berne?'",
        "'MR. BERNE': ' Yes. I just went -- I went through this very quickly, this matrix. I want to make sure you took out the butterfly weed and the raw milkweed from the list. I went very fast and could not see that. But, these should not be on the list, because the Monarchs do not lay many eggs on these milkweeds.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': ' Yes. And we're --'",
        "'MR. BERNE': ' And actually what will happen, is these milkweeds don't contain tox --toxins. And if the birds, if they caterpillars grow up on these, the birds will eat them. They will then learn to eat Monarch butterflies. So, that's why you should -- they should not be on any of these planting lists.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': ' That's right.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' It sounds like there may be further conversations about the details of the plan. And we really appreciate the dialog that I'm sure will continue with Mr. Berne and the design team.'",
        "'MS. VENONSKY': ' And we're happy to share this list.'",
        "'MR. BERNE': ' Please send me a copy.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you so much. Mr. Berne's testimony is also available on our website. And with that, our public testimony is concluded on this proposal. Thank you again, Mr. Berne. I'll now open it up to the Commission for discussion. And if the Commissioners could please turn on your cameras. I will start with Commissioner Dixon and then go in round robin format using our normal seating order. And please keep your webcams on. So, Mr. Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Yes. First, I want to again, indicate my pleasure in what's going on, and look forward to it. And I would like to be able to move this at the end.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Thanks so much for the presentation and for the additional testimony. It's an exciting project. I just want to thank everyone who's worked on it to get it to the point. The one minor caveat I've had in the past with these DDOT projects, is all about future governance. Hopefully in this case, because the Anacostia group is involved, that won't be as much of an issue. But, I always want to put on record that hopefully DDOT will do whatever it needs to do over the years with this new asset. But no, thanks. It's exciting.'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner Davis? (No response.)'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Okay, we'll move onto Commissioner Ginsberg?'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cozart?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'Very excited about this project and the progress that it's made over time. And how thoughtful the approach has been to really think about how infrastructure can reconnect communities. And in some ways, an idea ahead of its time and helping to, you know, kind of spur some of the thinking that we have at the federal level around reconnecting communities. So, really excited to see how that's developed. And I think this is really important from the District's perspective, both for the support of neighborhood development on both sides of the river. And so very excited about that. The one comment that I have, is that I was looking through the renderings, which were very exciting. And just want to encourage you as you do refinements to those, to really think about disabled people, people with differing abilities, and making sure that representation is there in some of those'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah. I don't have any comments. It's interesting to see this finally getting over what looks like the last hurdle here at NCPC. And a few more still to clear before it's built. But, look forward to seeing that.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Mic. I echo the comments, especially Mr. May's comments, looking, you know, it's been -- it's been an interesting process. And it's lovely to see how -- how interestingly and positively a lot of the, a lot of the comments and suggestions have been integrated into the final plan. And it's exciting. And it's exciting for everybody, but particularly this neighborhood, and having that kind of a, that kind of a bridge and an inference to a neighborhood that is, you know, that is not known partic -- known or appreciated as much as I hope it will be in the future as a result of this project. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Well, I am not a gusher. But, if I -- if we weren't at the end of a very long process, I probably would take time to gush. I want to just say a couple of things though. I think this project has the potential. It's not just about the neighborhoods in this case. I think it's going to put Washington on the map for a lot of really good reasons. We tend to, and I've seen this in our own projects, I'm embarrassed to say, we have a - -we have a concept that's really just top drawer. And then by the time we get to final, it's kind of lost some of its vim and verve, because we've designed by committee, and we just kill the spirit of the thing sometimes, more often than not. And in this case, I think that has not happened. It has gotten'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'better. And I can't think of a box it doesn't check for design and planning. So, that's as close to gushing as I'll get. And I'd just like to say, Scott Kratz, I don't know you, but I've been on your email list all these years. You are the hardest working guy in Washington. And it shows. So, I would like to congratulate you, because you're very close to pulling off something that is akin to a miracle in this city. And you should be really proud and so should the design team. It really is going to make the High Line look like it's, you know, amateur hour.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Commissioner Wright for those eloquent words. And for everyone, well-deserved praise for this project. I'm happy to say I have known Scott for a little more than ten years as a colleague and watching your work on this project. And I just want to say that I really commend you, Scott, and your team, for such a deep and sustained commitment to holistic innovative and inclusive planning and design as Commissioner Wright just stated so eloquently. And your work to address park equity that you took on, you know, in a deep way very early on. And with Commissioner Dixon's very watchful eye over that process. I think it's really been wonderful to see how this has turned out. And to ensure this project is a true benefit to the community, and the way you've done this, is setting a new standard for public realm planning. And, you'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'know, you and I have talked a lot about infrastructure reuse, and the high line network that's trying to lift up these projects around the United States for how we have multipurpose infrastructure, and understand the benefits that the public realm projects can bring to communities. But figuring out how to do it, and do it in a sustained way, because we have to think for the long term. These things don't happen overnight. So, I really appreciate everything that you all have done, you and your team, and the community frankly. That's a lot of volunteer hours and commitment that have gone into this. So, we're all very excited to see this move forward. So, congratulations. So, with that, are there any further comments or questions before we ask for a motion from a certain Commissioner to move this project? (No response.)'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Do I hear a motion to approve the final site development plans for the 11th Street Bridge Park?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'Madam Chair, I would make that motion. And to let people understand at least in my heart and mind that things related to the Anacostia River, to me, are very spiritual. So, some of the energy we got from other projects, I think, is a spiritual one, because the river is special to me at least, and to others, because if its history and its connection. I also wanted to point out that one of my classmates that grew up with me, he was one of the senior guys, is on the group that is selecting the art work there. I was asked to do it, but I thought he was better, because Huddy Flemmings (phonetic), was a guy who jumped in the river many years ago to swim and save a person. And he has a real special connection. And lives in Southeast still. So, I just think it's'",

    " 7. CASTLE PERIMETER SECURITY AND ELEVATOR OVERRUN": [
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Thank you, Chair White. Good afternoon Commissioners. Hopefully you can see my screen. The Smithsonian Institution has submitted revised preliminary plans for two components of their project, as the Chair has mentioned. This is the revitalization of the historic core, or the rock. The Commission approved the preliminary site and building plans for much of the project back in March. However, two components were not approved. Those included the perimeter security, as well as the elevator overrun at the east range of the Castle. The Applicant has submitted revised plans for both of these components, first for the perimeter security, which has been significantly reduced. And the proposed elevator overrun has actually been eliminated entirely. So again, this is preliminary review. The Commission evaluates the Applicant's approach to the proposed site and building plans, looks at the landscape and perimeter security design, impacts the key views, and how the project'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'has responded to previous Commission comments. In this case again, we're looking at those two components, the perimeter security and the elevator overrun, which the Commission did not approve previously. So, I think everybody's familiar with the South Mall Campus of the Smithsonian. But again, here for reference, it is located just south of the National Mall, south of Jefferson Drive, and north of Independence Avenue. I'll note that since the last review, the scope of the broader project has been revised to focus just on the Castle itself. The improvements to the Arts and Industries Building, the new cooling towers, and that tunnel that was proposed underneath the long panels of the Mall, are no longer included. As such, the perimeter security only includes the portion that is long, and along Jefferson Drive in front of the Castle. The perimeter security, which was proposed along Independence Avenue with AIB,'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'will move forward as a separate project. This will allow for additional time for coordination, particularly with DDOT, as we had discussed in March. Some of that coordination still needed to happen. So, again today, we're focusing just on Jefferson Drive. So, back in March, starting with the perimeter security, here's what you reviewed as part of those original plans. The perimeter security is highlighted here in red. This included, as you may recall long stretches of bollards in front of the Castle as well as AIB, essentially extending from west of the Castle to the Ripley Garden here on the east. At that time the project, as I mentioned, also included bollards along Independence Avenue. And this is a rendering from one of the options that you saw back in March. Again, the extensive line of bollards proposed along the curb on Jefferson Drive. This again, wrapped around the'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Castle continued towards AIB. So, in March the Commission expressed significant concerns with the proposal. And requested that the Applicant consider a more holistic approach to perimeter security, considering the entire length of Jefferson Drive in front of the Castle, Freer Gallery, and the AIB. You offered some recommendations to consider. First, minimize those long stretches of bollards. Second, minimize the number of locations where the bollards crossed the sidewalks. You may recall, there were several locations where the perimeter security kind of jumped back and forth between the curb and the building yard. Suggested that there be reduced, or minimized, alterations to any grade, to the changes of grade in front of the Castle. This is important, because the Castle itself, and these other buildings are historic landmarks. And then the Commission also requested additional plans and renderings of any new designs in further coordination with the National Park'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Service. So, in response to comments received from the Commission and others through the Section 106 process, the design for perimeter security has been substantially revised. The updated design does look holistically at the perimeter security on Jefferson Drive, from in front of the Freer, the Castle, as well as AIB. The design reduces the use of bollards and it uses new street furniture to provide secure perimeter security. In addition, the Smithsonian has determined that the areas requiring protection are much more limited. And thereby reducing the overall extent of the project. So, here on the top, you can see in red, there is a proposed perimeter security. These are Freer Gallery, the Castle, and then AIB. For reference here, you can see the original plan back from March. Again, really showing that extensive line of bollards that was originally proposed. So, the Applicant looked to design elements across'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'the South Mall Campus, which again, the Castle, AIB, and Freer, to inform the materials and the forms of the perimeter security features. These include things like the materials, the Seneca sandstone of the Castle, the patterned brick at AIB. They've also looked at some of the metal work, particularly the building trim, other ornamentals on several of the buildings, to apply in certain conditions. And you'll see those in some of the examples that they've developed. So, the perimeter security elements now include a collection of site furnishings, including low walls, strengthened or hardened seating elements, ornamental metal grills, as well as some other objects. These materials have the unified language of color, and form, and texture, again, drawing from the inspiration I just showed you. Here in this first slide, you can see some examples. There are still bollards included. These have been minimized as much as possible,'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'but other elements are also proposed. So, here you can see a hardened urn on the base that's incorporated into the perimeter security. There are some low walls, some also integrated with benches, as shown here on the bottom of the image. Other low walls with decorative metal grills. Again, the metal work is pulling from the designs in the buildings. And then also seating elements. These include benches. The Applicant has evaluated a couple of different alternatives with various designs, you can see here. I'll note that in the past, I know Commission Dixon has mentioned the idea of really looking at multipurpose security elements. So, this is a good example of where this functions for visitor use as a bench, but it also does meet the perimeter security needs. So, I will quickly walk you through the different sections of the perimeter security. First starting with the Freer,'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'this includes simply a series of bollards at the entry points for pedestrians. And then a connecting low wall with metal grill that wraps around the central landscape island. And this is just a rendering showing that same thing, the low wall with the gills, it's hidden here behind the landscape. Of course, there are still several bollards staged in front of the pedestrian areas to help protect those entries and gathering locations. I'll mention again, the focus of this project is on the Castle. But, per the Commission's request, they have provided these designs to show you how the perimeter security in the future could be extended to the Freer, and also, you'll see later, the AIB. And so moving on from Castle, the perimeter security again, is focused on the front of the building, essentially those entry points for pedestrians and gathering areas. This again, includes a combination'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'of bollards near the porte cochere, integrated benches, one bench here, a series of bollards, a decorative planted urn, and integrating new signage, that's also hardened. Again, the bollards, a decorative two- sided bench on either side of the portico, and then again, signage and benches on the other side of the Castle. And so here's just another, this is a rendering of that same area. So, you can see the various elements. This is the new signage which replaced existing signage onsite. And then closer to the main entrance to the Castle, you can see several bollards and then also this new hardened bench element, which would be double sided. And then this is just an elevation view showing essentially the same elements. You can see the hardened bench here, signage, the urn, the hardened urn, and then bollards and additional benches here. And I'll focus on these benches'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'here as I talk about some or our recommendations. In general, from staff's perspective, the reduced extent of the perimeter security, as well as the use of these new contact sensitive elements, is a significant improvement over the previous proposal. However, we do recommend additional refinement of the bench designs. As I mentioned, there are two freestanding double-sided benches. The footprint of which is highlighted here on this image on either side of the portico for the Castle. We do support the idea of integrating those security elements with features that can help support or be used by visitors. However, in this case, we did find that the proposed bench did seem quite large and bulky. And you can see here the kind of prospectus of what this element could look like. The hardened benches that I mentioned that are further to the west and east of the Castle, also'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'appear quite large. These are integrated into low walls. And so, they have the potential to look very long and monolithic and could potentially impact views towards the Castle. So, we do request that the Applicant reevaluate their proposed bench designs and consider additional refinements. This could include reducing the overall length, also reducing the width. Creating a more open base so it doesn't feel as solid or heavy. And/or breaking the benches up instead of providing just one long bench. And then moving on, this is the section from the AIB. Again, this is limited to the entry area. There's a series of bollards in front of the main stairs. And then hardened walls that are integrated into the landscape. And then this is just a rendering of the same area. Again, you can see the bollards that are proposed. You cannot really see the hardened landscape walls, those'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'are hidden by the perimeter -- by the landscape. Again, this is not part of the current project, but again, showing that the Applicant has taken to heart the idea that they need to look comprehensively at this entire stretch, per the Commission's last request. I'll also note that the Applicant is looking at updating the light fixtures with Olmsted light fixtures on Jefferson Drive. They are still looking at the alignment for these elements. These are not intended to be perimeter security, but they are - -continue to evaluate this approach. We do recommend that as the Applicant looks at the perimeter security and particularly these other streetscape elements that they should be coordinating with the National Mall Streetscape Manual Interagency Working Group as plans and details are developed for this stretch along Jefferson Drive. And then moving onto the other component. You'll recall that the Applicant was looking'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'at a new elevator overrun at the east end of the Castle. This was required to meet code and accessibility requirements as they look to increase the public access to the Castle. The previous design would have removed an old bulkhead, and replaced it with a new penthouse as part of that elevator replacement. However, this would have changed the roof line, and had impacts to the Castle. So, after further research, the Smithsonian has determined that they can use a machine room-less elevator in this location due to the historic preservation sensitivities of the Castle. As a result, there will not be any roof top penthouse required as part of this element. The existing elevator penthouse, which is not historic and not original, will be removed, and the historic roof line will be restored. So, staff definitely supports this revised design. And then finally, I just want to mention'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'something that has been a part of the Section 106 discussions related to interiors. There have been discussions about the extent of the consultation as it applies to the interior related to the broader RoC project. NCPC, the Smithsonian, and Advisory Council have been coordinating on this question. And the Advisory Council has helped highlight some, the legal concept, which applies in this case. Which is the idea of independent utility, or basically whether interior and exterior components of a project have separate and distinct functionality, or do they work together. NCPC and Advisory Council have concurred on a memorandum to the extent which NCPC's limited interior Section 106 obligations will apply. Regarding this project, there are two areas that will require some additional consultation. They include the replacement and new blast resistant windows. And then second, the new basement doors in the Castle. And I'm only noting this, because'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'these are not components of this part of the submission. But, they will be part of future reviews and we'll provide more information about this legal concept in the future. So, there's more to come on this, on these parts of the project. And so in conclusion, based on the comments received from the Commission and others, the design for the perimeter security on Jefferson Drive has been substantially reduced, revised. The design looks holistically at the entire campus, reduces the use of bollards, and uses new street furniture. In addition, the overall extent has been greatly reduced. Staff finds this new approach is much more sensitive to the setting and to the character of the Castle. And therefore, staff recommends preliminary approval. I have covered the rest of the recommendations, so I'm not going to repeat them. But, I am available for any questions. I will also now turn'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'it over to Ron Cortez, who is Undersecretary for Administration with the Smithsonian, for some brief comments. The Applicant and their design team are also available to help answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'Thank you, Mr. Flis. Good afternoon, Madam Chair White and Members of the Commission. It's pleasure to come before you today for this revised preliminary review of several elements of this long awaited project that will expand the public use of the Smithsonian's Castle Visitor Center. We hope that you will support the improvements made to design to significantly reduce the impact of perimeter security near the primary entrances of these historic buildings. And we look forward to addressing your recommendations in the final design. The revitalization of the Smithsonian's historic core, is along with the creation of the two museums a priority undertaking for the Smithsonian over the next decade. As Undersecretary of Administration, I'm working with Secretary Bunch to help secure these projects, which promise not only to transform our architectural legacy, but also how we achieve our mission to increase and defuse knowledge in ways that include'",
        "'MR. CORTEZ': 'all Americans. Our primary goals for the Castle continue to be the expansion of its public and competing space, the complete rehabilitation of its interior and exterior, and the addition of a seismic base isolation system to address earthquake resilience with the least impact to the historic fabric. We plan to return to the Commission early next year for the final review of the project. We are grateful to NCPC staff for their involvement in the ongoing historic preservation consultation process critical to completing the final design. Members of the Smithsonian and its design team are present to address any technical questions you may have. Thank you. I'll now turn this back.'",

But, I think, I just want to make it clear that I understand where bollards are needed to be for entrances where you can't block things that easily or well. But, there are ways that, you know, just the concept that if you put a disc with a hole in it that was the size of a bollard and just dropped it over it, it would create a table or a seat for people to rest a sandwich on or a drink. You know, you don't have to have it all through. But, just in addition to the bollard itself could be functional. I can think of all -- we had a whole booklet we did, and I thought this was in there. But, what a simple thing to do. Just'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'put a weighted disc so that it doesn't -- it's not movable, over the top of a bollard, so that it slides down over it. And maybe there be a notch in the bollard to catch it. And then we have some place for the tourists to put their sandwich down, or lay a bag down, or even maybe even sit on it. It doesn't have to be that large. But, for ways to take a break. A functional thing. You can't sit on a bollard, that's pretty rough, or use a bollard to balance your coffee cup or your tea on top of that. That's the kind of thing I'm think of, breaking it up with that and making it useful. So, I appreciate the effort, and maybe it can be done. I know there's always expense and restraints on things like this. But, what kind of expense to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'punch out a bunch of round discs with holes that fit over a bollard that would slip over it and create a space to sit things on, or to sit down on, basically like a bar stool. Yeah, thank you very much. I don't want to beat a dead horse, or whatever. Thank you.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' I just want to thank the Smithsonian for going back to the drawing board on a lot of the security. Security has become kind of a ubiquitous thing in the District over the past 20 years. It's great to see that you can still maintain your operational requirements, and kind of scale it back and use some other creative ways to shield some of it. So, I just, I really thank you for the thoughtfulness, and finding ways to minimize it. But agree that there's a little bit further refinement that maybe necessary just to kind of like lower that profile a bit. But, I think it shows that when you try hard enough, that you can meet the requirements with a little less intrusion. So, thanks for that.'",

So, certainly you know, being able to do away with the changes to the roof that were necessary for the elevator. That's such a huge thing. And then of course, perimeter security, which is a big concern of ours, given that, you know, it borders the Mall right there. The -- I will say the -- I agree with much of the comments for further refinement coming from staff. I'll also say that our interest in this project is not limited to the fact that it is, you know, it's on the Mall. It's also the fact that this is an NHL. And our staff have been monitoring that very closely throughout, because we have to weigh in on'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'any potential impacts to an NHL. And there are a few things that are not quite clear yet. And I assume that they will be addressed in further development before we get to a final approval, and before everything is completed on the Section 106 side. Some of the things that were noted to me were the roof top egress on the east range roof, the perimeter moat details that will be necessary for base isolation as that goes forward, and then the expansion of the areaways around the perimeter. I would also note that there are, you know, we are glad to have resolution on the issue of the legal standard for interior review under Section 106, because that was an issue that was hanging out there. I'm not sure I am -- really loved the net result. But, it is an unusual circumstance with the Smithsonian and their'",

The -- and in terms of the staff comments, I think the other thing we mentioned is that the comments about the freestanding benches and how they might be further refined, that applies not just for the ones that are freestanding, but all -- and but those that are built in the landscaped areas as well.

I think -- I think what I was seeing, especially in my time on the Commission, and I've also had to deal with, in another -- in another time of my life, balancing the design goals, the design aspects with the need for security. And integrating those two things is always a challenge. And good for them for doing the work that they're doing. And doing it and presenting to us these refinements and these changes.

They were really, really intrusive, I thought, in front of the porte cochere especially. The consulting party meetings have -- your consulting parties have given you a lot of good advice, I think, on finishes and furnishings. I agree with the staff assessment, those benches kind of -- they're beautiful in --on a smaller, I mean, they look like cruise ships now. They -- because they're so long, because you're trying to get them to do their job as security elements, they've sort of lost some of the inherent elegance in the design.

And I think the approach of the Smithsonian team to perimeter security, is exactly what we were looking for, as you've heard from our Commission. We appreciate the effort to keep security elements out of the public space. But know it's a delicate balance that you're trying to reach. So, I agree with staff that additional refinements are necessary for the benches. Sounds like these are already underway. And thank you, Commissioner May, that really should be all benches.

The Commission provided comments on the draft Master Plan at its July 7 meeting just a few months ago. Prior to that, the Commission last approved a Master Plan for ANC in 2015. As a reminder, ANC is a 639-acre cemetery located in Arlington Country, Virginia. This Commission approved two expansions to the cemetery in the last few years. The millennium expansion was approved in 2015, with construction completed in 2019. And the southern expansion received its final revised approval in 2021. But of these expansions will provide ANC much needed burial capacity. This Master Plan before you does not propose any additional expansion of the cemetery outside its current boundaries. I will also note that in 2020, a land swap occurred between the National Park Service and'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'ANC, in which the land associated with the approach into the cemetery, via Memorial Avenue, to the Women in Military Service for America Memorial, or WIMSA, including the road and area on both sides of the hedgerow was transferred for NPS's jurisdiction to ANC. ANC had used the land under a Memorandum of Agreement. But now it is fully under ANC's jurisdiction. For the final review of the Master Plan, the Commission should be focused on such issues as, has the Applicant addressed the comments from the Commission on the previous review? And are there any resolved issues with the final Plan? I'll cover these topics throughout the presentation and how the Applicant responded to the Commission's previous comments. Back in July, the Commission provided comments on the draft Master Plan for ANC, commenting favorably on the goals and overall approach presented in the draft. And commended the Plan's commitment'",

Since the draft review, the Applicant has responded to the Commission's comments and recommendations for the final review, including ongoing coordination with the National Park Service. The remaining unresolved issue relates to an identified flex space area in Area Development Plan One, which is just north of Memorial Avenue that the Applicant has identified for potential long range projects, including possible development of new columbaria. I will discuss this in upcoming slides. As a reminder, the Master Plan divides the cemetery into four Area Development Plans for discussion. The Area Development Plan One is the entry corridor. The Memorial Amphitheater is ADP two. The service complex, which really encompasses the entire cemetery. And the Meigs- Tanner area, which is near Arlington House. A fifth area is the'",

In the final Master Plan, identified projects are notional in nature, with potential locations included in specific ADPs. I note that individual projects identified in this final Master Plan, will be designed at the individual project stage, and submitted for Commission review and approval. And that the Applicant has committed to work with the review agencies for early coordination during the early design phases of each individual project. The first area we'll look at is ADP One, which is the entry corridor area. And'",

Most of the proposed future projects involving new structures are located in ADP One, and include projects to address pedestrian and vehicle conflicts and enhancing the visitor experience. It also includes security related projects, such as a new standalone pedestrian security facility to the east of the Welcome Center, and new vehicle screening facilities both along Memorial Avenue and at the visitor parking garage. For ADP One, staff finds that the new visitor screening facility adjacent to the Welcome Center, will allow the Welcome Center to better function as a place for visitors to seek information and orientation to the cemetery. In addition, staff finds that the proposed mobile vehicular screening facility on Memorial Avenue, will be designed in such a way by the Applicant,'",

However, as I mentioned earlier, the remaining issue in the Plan relates to an identified flex space north of Memorial Avenue. The areas north and south of Memorial Avenue, behind the holly hedges, excuse me, holly hedgerows, which also include oak rows, are documented contributing landscape features for the larger National Registered Historic District for Arlington Memorial Bridge and environs, which includes the Memorial Avenue area. For the final Master Plan submitted, the Applicant has indicted that for any possible projects that maybe identified in the potential flex space north of Memorial Avenue, they will ensure any development has minimal impacts to the mature oaks, and remain lower than the hedgerows.

Therefore, staff recommends that the Commission defers action on the ADP One area identified as flex space north of Memorial Avenue, due to the potential impacts to historic landscape resources and view sheds in this area. In addition, staff requests when additional space is needed, prior to site selection for any new development, the Applicant provide a greater analysis of other possible flex space areas throughout the cemetery. And will include an analysis for potential impacts to any historic landscape features and view sheds. Finally, staff notes that if the identified area north of Memorial Avenue in this Plan is determined to be the most suitable for future flex development, including possible columbaria, design will need to be sensitive to the identified historic landscape features and view sheds. The next ADP we'll look at is ADP Two,'",

ADP Two, which covers an area in the southwestern part of the cemetery, it contains the Memorial Amphitheater, giving it its name, and the reception building, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, considerable burial space, particularly to the south and west of Memorial Amphitheater, and the grounds surrounding the Amphitheater. Proposed projects in ADP Two, are primarily to improve access and the visitor experience. Therefore, staff finds that the projects at the Memorial Amphitheater will improve Amphitheater accessibility, interior space functionality, and pedestrian circulation and way finding. Next is the service complex. And as I mentioned, this area for the service complex, spans the entire cemetery. In response to the Commission's request at the draft review, the Applicant has committed to preserve historical view sheds, and will ensure that any new areas for service functions and lay down areas, are not located within cemetery areas'",

The next ADP is ADP Four, which is the Meigs-Tanner ADP located in the northwest portion of the cemetery that lies west of the President John F. Kennedy grave site, and Arlington House, both primary guest destinations to the cemetery. For ADP Four, the Master Plan includes opportunities to improve the visitor experience and safety with way finding, improved sidewalk access, expanded tram stops, and traffic improvements. As requested by the Commission at the draft review, the Applicant has committed to continue coordination with the National Park Service at monthly meetings between ANC and the NPS Superintendent regarding any strategies to address pedestrian safety and desired new walkways in the areas adjacent to Arlington House. Finally, in respect to transportation needs under this Plan, staff finds that the Applicant has committed to continue to improve the transportation safety in service'",

It's like, I think, number ten of their potential projects in ADP Two. That's why we feel like when they need to look for additional space for any development, they need to do a more thorough analysis of where it's appropriate.'",

So, it was never considered as any space except for National Park Service Space. So, once the land was transferred to Arlington National Cemetery, we looked at it and said hey, this could be a potential columbarium. Or it could be a potential -- and that's why we didn't actually identify it as a single purpose, but as flex space. Like, it's a piece of land, it's about 1.6 acres that could be used for internments. We're not sure, because we know that there's a big utility corridor going through that area. So, we're not even sure about the viability. And before we'",

So, we've actually only had possession of the land for two years. Over.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah. Yeah, and if we -- if we weren't, I would suggest that. Because with all due respect, the transfer had to have been in the works for a long time. It would have probably been smarter just to leave it out, you know, rather than say --because it's just a big flashing red warning, warning light when you -- flex space is probably not something that a master plan would include. I mean, it's too mysterious. That's all I'm saying. So, I think the staff report is just right.'",

So, before the land transfer in 2020, we had a Memorandum of Understanding, an Agreement, I forget which one of one, between Arlington National Cemetery and National Park Service that allowed us to have an existing mobile screening facility. And that screening facility, it doesn't look very attractive, and it's not very honorific. And we would like to develop something that is a little bit more in keeping with the architecture and the hallowed grounds of the cemetery. We have not done any planning to that effect, because again, this area did not belong to us. And it's difficult for us to spend any planning dollars for an area that technically was not in our possession. So, we have refrained from doing that. Although we have requested funds to do that in the future. We have requested planning dollars to develop concepts that we are hoping that we'",

And I know even though it was not necessarily attractive, it was also quite minimal, right? It was not, it did not involve any kind of structure that got rolled out there or anything like that. So, can you tell me how it would function? What the functions are that you're intending to have there? I mean, are you going to have an air-conditioned space for guards to stand in? Are you going to have drop down bollards or socket barriers? I mean, what are you imaging this thing to be? Is it just a checkpoint? So, you need to have a place where somebody can stand in the shade, much like it is now. So, what's the functional improvement that you're looking for?'",

So, it's a balancing act. Unfortunately, I am not a security expert. And we have not gone into those deep discussions. We just know that the existing system that is out there, we just don't think is in keeping with the architecture and the nature of how the cemetery should run. So, we would like to go back, and do some planning. Look at past functions and architecture, and landscaping of Arlington National -- and Memorial Avenue, and do that deep dive.

        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' I do have a question, Commissioner May. As I recall from the brief, and of course entirely it's on the computer, and it's not working well. And I hope you guys can hear me. But, I'm struck by the word in the brief that said mobiles. But, I would, you know, what I'm hearing is some kind of perhaps permanent screening facility. So, I think that's something that's got to be addressed. And perhaps, well, I don't think it would be handled just like a columbarium because security is required. But, I think we need to note how that screening location is called out in the presentation. And for ANC to use as they come back to us with their vision of what that's going to look like. Over.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Well, that's exactly what I was concerned about. What I was trying to understand is what do they mean by mobile, right? So, is it something that can be rolled out of the way, I mean, that's --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' What's the program?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' And managing it.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, what's the program for it?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' It's something that could be put away if need be. Right?'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' So, the current plan is to have a mobile screening facility, which is to have it be removable, yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Okay. And are you -- I mean, other than things that might be necessary to, you know, like an electrical conduit or connection, or things like that, are you actually going to be thinking that you're planting stuff in the ground?'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' That is an option --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Or do you not know yet?'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' Currently, we do have a portable generator there that we don't think is very sustainable, because it does get hot in, you know, the summer. So, there's the --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Oh, I understand the need for electricity. And putting stuff underground, no big deal, right? It's the question of whether you're planning to plant barriers or foundations for buildings, things like that. That's the kind of thing that I was curious about. But, you -- it doesn't sound like you've gotten very far in thinking that through.'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' Yeah.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' But it sounds like --'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' We haven't -- we've not done any planning on that.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, okay. All right. I'll leave the rest of my comments for when we are deliberating.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' But, it sounds like we'll want to hear more when that planning really commences and we can understand the distinction that you're trying to describe there and solve. Thank you. Any other questions for Mr. Webb or Ms. Sullivan from Commissioners? Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Yeah. I just wanted to not spend too much more time on the mobile facility. But, one thought that I had when we were out there, and I continue to have this thought, is why do we really need to have a facility, a screening facility there? And that then begs the question, why do you need to have any vehicular traffic down that far on Memorial Avenue? And if you're now going to -- if we're going to approve or be supportive of the new main vehicle security screening that's going to go down to the garage, it seems to me there's a road network that could get those same vehicles to where they need to be for any staging for the various services and everything. So, I'm just wondering -- I guess my question would be, are you all confident in your assessment that this additional screening facility'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'is so needed that we'd be looking at putting even a temporary facility there, or a movable facility? Or have you examined if there's any way to integrate the new vehicular screening area for the general public and see if you can't just tie into the network? And if that would have less of an impact than kind of playing around with Memorial Avenue?'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': 'So, Commissioner Cash, I'm really happy that you brought that up. Because that is one of the things that we are looking at is as we do a screening facility for visitors, is there a way to also apply that screening facility for funeral attendees and general staff? So, that is one of the items that we'll be looking at, because we do have an alternate road that could get you into Arlington National Cemetery from the parking garage. We just don't know what the realm of possibilities and the capacity of those roads are, as compared to the traffic. So, part of the planning that we are going to do, and when we develop some concepts, is to do a traffic study to see if that is possible. But, I didn't want to make any promises, like that mobile screening facility is going away, when I can't prove that'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': 'yet. Over.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Okay. I would really appreciate that, looking at that moving forward before we finalize anything like that. I mean, I'm just looking at the map here. So, I think we're already giving up a little bit by having this, the regular visitor screening facility, because it impacts all those folks that are walking back and forth from the metro. But, I'd like, if we're going to go that route, I'd like to try and see whatever we can do to preserve Memorial Avenue. So, I think this is a real opportunity for Memorial Avenue to also be transformed into something that's more pedestrian friendly, especially now that we're moving more people down towards the Visitor Center. And just kind of re-image that like we did in front of the White House. It's just less of a roadway and more of a pedestrian zone, especially for all the tourists there. So,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'any work you can continue to do on that to see if there's way to mitigate this would be great.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Are there any other questions?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Madam Chair, I did have --'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' One other new question. And this is really for Mr. Webb. Maybe he knows the answer to this. But, whatever the work is that happens here, is this subject to Commission of Fine Arts review? Because I know that art work in Arlington House is subject to CFA review.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Yes. My understanding, once the actual, the project designs, CFA will be involved in those coordination meetings and as a consulting party.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Oh.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Yes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' And as a consulting party?'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Yes, correct.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' But, also for formal Commission reviews, not just -- not just as a CP.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Yes. And Ms. Sullivan, that is correct. I think that was, yeah.'",
        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' Yes. We always consult with CFA when it comes to anything, even a tree tack at Arlington National Cemetery, we submit that for approval to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Okay. I just wanted to confirm that. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. If there are no other questions, we do have one person signed up to speak, Laura Moore, on behalf of the Guild of Professional Tour Guides. Ms. Moore, you will have five minutes to provide your testimony. Welcome.'",
        "'MS. MOORE': ' Okay. I think I'm on now.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'I really appreciate it and this presentation as well. Yeah, so speaking on behalf of the Guild of Professional Tour Guides of Washington, D.C., which I think some of you know, is our professional association, about 500 licensed D.C. guides and affiliated tour operators. As for myself, I've been a licensed D.C. tour guide since 2010. So, I have had the honor of leading thousands of visitors each year, each year to and through the cemetery. And it's really not an exaggeration to say that this is one of the really greatest honors of my professional life, to have the privilege of introducing this special place to visitors of so many backgrounds from so many places, so many different ages. Lots of school groups, but a lot of adult and senior citizen groups as well. It's hard to find the words to describe the meaning these visits hold for, just'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'as an example, a 13-year-old girl thinking of her brother stationed in Afghanistan as she participated in a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. That's just one of thousands of examples that my colleagues and I could share with you. The majority of visitors who walk through the cemetery are part of the kinds of tour groups that guides work with. The Guild also liaises with the tour operators who plan the tours, as well as the motorcoach operators that carry them. So, we do consider ourselves a key stakeholder and also an important resource. We are here to help. We're also very aware of the need for revamping that entry area at security, and to preserve visitor flow and accessibility. So, we were really pleased to see that the Master Plan tackled these issues, highlights the goal of enhancing the visitor experience, in particular, even'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'as we understand always, that the overarching mission of the cemetery is to honor those who are interned there. That's a message that we share with our groups as well. We especially support separating the Welcome Center function from the security function, and increasing visitor amenities, especially restrooms. Guides are obsessed with restrooms. We're also taken with the pedestrian modes idea, to paraphrase the Master Plan, pausing for grouping and pivoting to the next point of exploration, is actually a pretty good description of a lot of our job as well. Reading the Master Plan, we do find ourselves with some questions and concerns that we did want to share. We look forward to discussing them further with Ms. Sullivan and the Arlington Cemetery team. For example, the Master Plan mentions self-guided tours using the ANC explorer app, and addresses visitors arriving at nodes or points on the tram. But,'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'we don't see any specific mention of tour groups, who again, make up the bulk of the pedestrian traffic through the cemetery, especially during the busy season. And groups, tour groups have particular needs that are different from those of individuals guiding themselves. That includes making space together to speak with the group without impinging on graves or other hallowed areas. That's what we see the flex space is for. We are most concerned, however, with changes that might increase the time it takes groups to get through security and into and through the cemetery, or that might lead to crowding and congestion at entry points. There are a lot of factors on our tours that are out of our hands as tour guides, traffic, broken down busses, street closures, I am thinking about the Army Ten Miler this Sunday when I'm meeting a group there. And groups have very,'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'very tight schedules as well, which we have no control over. During this busy spring tourist season, motorcoaches line up all the way down Memorial Drive before the 8:00 a.m. opening. And the bus parking area frequently fills up before 9:00 a.m., sometimes well before 9:00 a.m. Meanwhile, at any given time in the morning, there could be, you know, 20 guides waiting outside the Welcome Center for their group's buses to arrive. Twenty guides equate to 1,000 visitors approximately. So, with motorcoaches having to go through the vehicular screening, we are concerned that the crowding at the vehicle entrance will worsen. And also we want to be sure there is a safe way for coaches to drop off passengers and for the passengers to meet their guides when they are not able to park. I also wanted to note that tour guides arrive as pedestrians, but then we meet'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'our groups arriving by vehicle, by motorcoach. So, separating pedestrian/vehicle access could be problematic. So, we're wondering, do passengers go through additional screening after the bus drops them off? Or will guides meet them? So, in short, we worry about additional hurdles that maybe added to entry into the cemetery and flow through the cemetery. An added layer of security, if it's poorly designed or implemented, could be the difference between a school group making their wreath laying time. And those times are nonnegotiable. Or even seeing the changing of the guard at all. But, even with the current security and flow, we often struggle to get our groups to the Tomb on time. We know from our years of experience that a visit to the cemetery, witnessing the changing of the guard, and especially when that visit includes the wreath laying, is the highlight of the school trip to'",
        "'MS. MOORE': 'Washington. And for the wreath layers, those four wreath layers, it happens once in a lifetime. So, in short we bring experience on the ground, practical experience to these matters. Again, we are here to help.'",
        "'STAFF': ' Five minutes.'",
        "'MS. MOORE': ' Thanks. I'm wrapping up. We really want to help the cemetery and its mission while providing those meaningful experiences to our visitors. And I did want to say, I understand that a lot of this is notional. But, we really look forward to continuing these conversations as the implementation goes forward. Again, these visits of these groups are an opportunity of a lifetime. So, thank you so much.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Ms. Moore, for those thoughtful and very practical comments based on your experience. I'm sure they are appreciated by the planners. Does the Commission have any questions about Ms. Moore's testimony? (No response.)'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Seeing and hearing none, that concludes the public testimony on this proposal. And I will now open it up to Commission for discussion. Could everyone please turn on their cameras. I will start with Commissioner McMahon, and then go in a round robin format. Please keep your webcams on during the discussion. I'm sorry, Commissioner Davis, did you have a question?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' No, I did not. Sorry.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Okay. I just saw the hand, so thank you. Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thank you, Chair White. No, I have nothing else to add. But, besides my earlier comments, I think there's a good conversation to be had concerning guidance on that mobile screening center. I understand the views at issue with dealing with that. And so, perhaps we'll discuss that with as we go around with the other Commissioners. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yes. So, first of all I want to say, you know, we appreciate the ongoing coordination between the Secretary and the superintendent at the regular meetings to resolve any issues that arise. As far as I know, they're, they're, you know, things are going well. I haven't heard, you know, any concerns coming from the Superintendent's Office. But that is an important thing, and it has to remain ongoing. I am very glad to see that the Executive Director has recommended that ADP-1, that flex space, is not going to be part of the approval here, and that will be held off until further planning is done. I, you know, I have to say, frankly, the right thing to do would be to simply eliminate that, the possibility of flex space there, because I don't see any room for flex. It is, I think that the -- you know, if'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'anything happens there, it should be a total restoration of the rows of trees that were part of the original design. And I don't think that that affords an opportunity to do a columbaria or areas or anything else, frankly. But that's, I guess we'll take that up when, when the ANC is prepared to or has done more of the necessary planning on their part to consider what they could do. And maybe they'll come to the same conclusion that I have. And then regarding the mobile screening facility, I really appreciate Commissioner Cash's comment about the possibility that it might not be necessary, that this could be something that is, essentially, incorporated into the other screening facility in some form. And I think that would be a terrific way to handle it, and opening it out to a more pedestrian activity, I think would be very good. But'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'I think most importantly, simply having that broad avenue the way it was designed, and not cluttered up with the kind of security stuff that we seem to stick in public spaces without sufficient regard for the, you know, the impact on people's experience. So, I, you know, I get a little concerned when we start talking about the architecture of what that mobile screening facility would be, because that implies that it's a building. And I know I didn't hear that specifically that they're talking about putting in a building, but a building is completely out of the question. And if it is, if there is going to be anything there in terms of mobile screening facility, it should be something that is very mobile, right. Something that you can take away at the drop of a hat. Because anything more than that it's just going to wind up'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'sitting there, and it will be part of everybody's experience on a regular basis. So, something, you know, whatever is done there, maybe it has to be different from what's there now, but it should be kept to the absolute minimum, and it should be something that could go away very quickly and, in fact, probably should go away, you know, whenever the cemetery is not open for public visitation. So, and that, you know, including evenings and things like that. So, those are my thoughts on this. Otherwise, you know, I appreciate the staff report and am prepared to vote to the EDR. Thank you.'",

And I think the improvements around the Visitor's Center, as we've heard from others, will make for a better experience. And, clearly, we look forward to working with you on additional analysis and discussion about that flex space in the future. And we certainly understand the need and the challenges that you have at the cemetery in finding space for what you need to achieve there. We just want to make sure the solution is the least impactful to the historic landscape features and viewsheds, which has been stated today. So, thank you, also, for hosting the Commission on a tour. It was very helpful for everyone to see what you're trying to accomplish there and how it operates. So,'",

        "'MS. WHITE': ' Next is Agenda Item 6D for the approval of comments on the Draft Master Plan for the George Bush Center for Intelligence. And we will be hearing from Mr. Hart.'",
        "'MR. HART': ' Hopefully, everyone can hear me.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Yes. And we can see you.'",
        "'MR. HART': 'Excellent. Good afternoon, Madam Chair and members of the Commission. The U.S. Government has submitted the George Bush Center for Intelligence Draft Master Plan for comments by the Commission. This campus is located in Fairfax County, Virginia, just south of the Potomac River. It was last before the Commission and it was updated and approved by the Commission in 2006. As a overview, the Commission's review of the Draft Master Plan focuses on a few concerns. These are listed here, regarding land use, transportation, and environmental protection, as well as historic preservation. These are some of the questions that we ask as you consider these, this master plan Here is an aerial photograph. This installation is highlighted in yellow. And the main feature on the installation is the main headquarters building, which is shown here. And this was originally opened in 1962. I will note that the main points of'",
        "'MR. HART': 'access to the installation are from the south, along Route 123, and from the north, along George Washington Memorial Parkway. The existing installation plan is shown here in a bit more detail. You can see the main buildings on the campus as well as the --which are the dark color, which as well as the parking areas, which are shown here in the lighter gray color. The main focus of the Master Plan is to modernize the office space and provide a safer, more enjoyable experience for campus employees and visitors. Over the next few slides I'll describe the existing land use, historic resources, topography, wet -- excuse me, woodland, streams, and circulation. Following that I will show the proposed development included in the Master Plan. So, the existing land uses are shown here. And you'll notice that most of this area is owned by the Federal Government, which is'",
        "'MR. HART': 'this kind of light blue or purple color. And there are several different entities: the George Washington Memorial Parkway and which is overseen by the National Park Services; and the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, which is overseen by the Federal Highway Administration. Also included here are residential areas which are to the east and to the south. And these are indicated with a peach color. Next, we see some historic resources on campus. I'd like to point out that the original headquarters building and the auditorium dome here in the northern part of the campus were built in 1961 and opened in 1962. I'll also note that the Scattergood-Thorn House, which is a 1926 Georgian Revival house, is located on the southern portion of the installation. It is actually the oldest building on the, on the campus. And as a note, the Margaret Scattergood -- excuse me. As a note,'",
        "'MR. HART': 'Margaret Scattergood and Florence Thorn owned the house and were very influential in the American Federation of Labor in the early to mid-20th Century. So, here are some topographic changes on the installation. There are steep slopes on the north and east of the installation. There are some other steep slopes which are indicated with this kind of orange-brown color throughout different parts of the installation as well. Now, we see some main landscapes on the installation. There are woodlands, which are shown here on the, again, northern and eastern portion of the installation. And throughout the rest of the installation is maintained landscape and some other woodland preservation areas. We see some streams and wetland on the installation as well. Mainly these are in the northern and eastern portion of the campus. These areas will not be disturbed as part of this Master Plan. And, finally, this map is'",
        "'MR. HART': 'the current campus circulation plan, with installation entrances. As I noted earlier, the entrance from 123 is shown here. The entrance from GW, George Washington Memorial Parkway to the north is shown here. I'll also note that there are entrances along the Colonial Farm Road, which are shown here on the west. There is a loop road that's shown here as well. And there are some paved areas and some parking garages surrounding that, that loop road area. And I'll note that there is a -- there is some parking that's outside this loop road area. And it has the potential to cause vehicular-pedestrian conflicts. So, the installation is not very pedestrian friendly. So, we get to the Draft Master Plan itself. This has a 20-year outlook, and includes a number of goals. They are: Addressing unsatisfied mission needs; Identifying areas for new development on the campus; Recapitalization to support'",
        "'MR. HART': 'sustainability goals by improving stormwater management; And reducing impervious surface area on the campus to develop a rational plan to address future needs. This is an overview of the plan, which identifies campus development sectors. The campus gateway, which is this area here, is the main entrance for visitors and employees. The northeast and north sectors are where the main headquarters building is located. There is new parking that's being planned here that will replace the existing surface parking areas. The Campus Center, which is this kind of brown area here, is a new amenity for the campus that incorporated outdoor space for employees, with a water feature that doubles as a stormwater management facility. Campus Support is located here on the west, is an area for back office components that support the rest of the installation. Also included here would be additional parking structures that will replace existing surface'",
        "'MR. HART': 'parking areas. And, finally, the south campus, shown here in orange -- excuse me, in green, is identified as an area for consolidated development and a new child development center. The Master Plan will include pedestrian amenities, such as the pathways, sidewalks, plazas, and memorial features to make the installation a more inviting space to add to the experience. Also included in the Master Plan are sustainable elements such as rooftop solar panels on all of the parking structures, electric charging stations for charging electric cars in the parking structures, and stormwater management facilities throughout different parts of the installation to help with the stormwater management. Staff has reviewed the full Master Plan, and recommends that the Commission support the George Bush Campus for Intelligence Draft Master Plan, which describes a comprehensive vision for this campus located in Fairfax County, by providing a more orderly campus development while modernizing the'",
        "'MR. HART': 'office space, removing temporary office space additions at the historic original headquarters building, and creating a new southern precinct for additional development. Also, protecting the natural resources by maintaining existing forested areas, improving stormwater management through the introduction of management ponds, and reducing impervious surface area by 10 percent, or 26 acres, which with the removal of existing surface parking lots, and replacing them with structured parking. Also, improving sustainable development by installing rooftop solar panels for the parking garages, and providing electric vehicle charging stations on campus. And, finally, introducing pedestrian sidewalks, pathways, and outdoor spaces which will improve the on-campus pedestrian safety, and provide pleasant spaces outside for employees to enjoy and learn about the agency's history. Staff has also three other recommendations for the Applicant: One, to demonstrate how the parking ratio of 1:2 will be achieved when submitting the parking garages in the future. The second'",
        "'MR. HART': 'is to submit a detailed tree replacement plan with the final Master Plan. And the third is to include design guidelines for the proposed child care center, which will be in close proximity to the history Scattergood-Thorn House with the final Master Plan. And it is with that that the Commission supports this campus Draft Master Plan. And as I've actually gone through this already, I'm not going to repeat it here, I am available to answer questions. And with that, I'd like to conclude my presentation. Thank you.'",

        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Hearing no comments, thank you, Mr. Hart, for the presentation. And I just want to state we appreciate the attention that the Applicant is bringing to sustainability, employee amenities in the new development as it relates to the historic center building. It's also really great to see the removal of so much surface parking and pavement in general. And I know there's indications that the parking structures will have a solar canopy, which is always really great to see. So, we strongly encourage you to build this into the project design. We're seeing this more and more at installations, and we think it's a really effective way to help achieve sustainability.

    "10. INFORMATION PRESENTATION K STREET TRANSITWAY": [
        "'MS. WHITE': ' The last item on the agenda is an information presentation on the K Street Transitway. We will be hearing from Mr. Weil. Welcome, Mr. Weil.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' Thank you very much. Okay, just let me know when you can see that.'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': ' We can see that. And we can hear you.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'Okay, thank you. Thank you and good afternoon, Madam Chair and members of the Commission. Today we have the District Department of Transportation here to present their most recent plans for a new transitway along a portion of the K Street corridor in Northwest Washington, D.C. K Street serves as a major crosstown, east-west connection across the city, extending through Washington, D.C.'s downtown area between Florida Avenue in the east and the Whitehurst Freeway on the west. The new transitway would transform an 11 block section of the K Street corridor between 12th and 21st Streets, N.W., into a more formalized, multi-mobile street, eliminating the existing service lanes, and installing new separate bus and bicycle lanes, new landscaped medians, and replacing the general purpose lanes. Here is a closer-up map of the planned new transitway project area which would pass by three National Park Service properties: Farragut Square, McPherson Square,'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'and Franklin Park. The concept for the project started back in the 1990s, with active planning initiated in the early 2000s, starting with the K Street Transitway feasibility study. During the initial feasibility study, NCPC and the Downtown BID sponsored a two-and-a-day charrette to discuss the need to transform K Street into a grand urban boulevard, with a number of defining characteristics that would include robust landscaping, with a continuous tree canopy, minimal service functions, and a new street designed in an integrated manner from building to building face. For the past two years, DDOT has been designing the new multi-modal K Street section with a 35 percent plan in 2020, a 65 percent design this past summer. And DDOT now has a 90 percent design which they will present to you here shortly. While NCPC does not have a direct review authority over the project, based on its nature'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'as a series of traditional streetscape improvements within the K Street right-of-way, NCPC does have an interest based on our planning partnership with the District Government, as well as the project's adjacency to three National Park Service properties, and the historic origins of the K Street corridor within the L'Enfant Plan. And one last note is that I will summarize our initial staff comments at the conclusion of DDOT's portion of today's presentation for Commission consideration and deliberation. And we will forward our guidance to DDOT in a letter, in addition to any other comments that we hear today from Commission members. So, with that, I would like to now introduce Ms. Robyn Jackson, who is a Deputy Program Manager with DDOT's Infrastructure and Project Management Division. And she is the manager for the Transitway project's ongoing design and development. So, with that, I will hand the presentation off to'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'Ms. Jackson.'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'Good afternoon, everybody. Again, my name is Robyn Jackson, Deputy Program Manager here at DDOT. Actually, the Project Manager is Lee Wilson, that many of you know. And he is joining us in the audience and let me invite him along for questions and answers, if there are any after this presentation. Next slide. Again, thank you all for inviting us for this information session. We are happy to come back out to the public and go over some items that be of interest to you on how we've progressed from 60 to 90 percent. Also, I have to say that a lot of our renderings in this presentation are from previous presentations, so I'll talk through what is different from those renderings and what's in our design. A lot of the project background overview has been covered, so I'll go through those very quickly. Streetscape enhancement we'll talk about,'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'the landscaping and the zones, opportunities for branding, transit improvement and operations, pedestrian and bicycle improvements, as well as next steps. Next slide, please. Next slide. Okay. So, very quickly through the project background over the years. Next slide. Again, the project is from 21st to 12th Street along -- in downtown along K Street. We'll skip these for the sake of time. Next slide. And then, as Michael mentioned, from 2005 we started off the Transitway, pivoted to a streetcar in 2013, and now back to a Transitway in 2022 is where we are now. This design process has been going on since 2019 to 2022, and we've been in final design. Next, please. And so, our typical view of the corridor, you'll notice that we'll have two transit lanes running down the center, two bicycle lanes that are adjacent to the transit lanes, and then four travel lanes.'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'And then some blocks contain loading and parking where available, but mostly it has been moved to the side streets. Next slide, please. And these are the views at the parks. The main difference here, as you'll note, that we do not have the center median. And this is mostly due to right-of-way constraints and not impacting National Park Service property. Next slide, please. So, I'll go through streetscape enhancements. I want to reiterate that the scope here is from building face to building face. So, we are replacing all of the sidewalk between the building face and the back of curb, except for areas that are permitted by building owners. We are replacing with London pavers. And I'll show you more what that will look like. We have a mini zone and a clear path so that they're maintained through here. And we understand that pedestrian experience is critical'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'to the economic health and success of the downtown area. Next slide, please. Okay. So, the sidewalk zone we're showing London pavers. And this is typical of what you see through a downtown area. And this was also discussed with the BID, going through different types of materials with them of what we can do. And this is what we have landed on. And then we have this tree pit zone that's showing, like, these charcoal gray concrete pavers that are 4 x 8 herringbone pattern. This is still being coordinated with the BID as far as the shape -- or not the shape, the size of those pavers. And just to be able to install many of these in the area that we're looking at. And so, we have the diagram on the right-side of the screen showing you where the sidewalk is, sidewalk zones are, and where the'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'mini zones are. Next slide, please. Here are some examples of what that looks like currently downtown. So here at Connecticut Avenue it's not exactly going to look like this. I just want to throw that out there. But I just want to show you how, showing you just the difference between the pavers, the London pavers, and then either granite pavers, both. We're going to do a pavement section down in that mini zone. So, I'm just showing you that there's a mini zone, and that there's a sidewalk zone. And then the picture to the right is showing those London pavers at 1201 K Street. Here you'll see the designer at that time picked, chose to do a variation of patterns and colors of shades of gray of London pavers. And that's something that's available that we're coordinating with the BIDs -- and when I say bids I'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'mean Golden Triangle BID and Downtown BID -- as far as what features to include on K Street Transitway. Next slide, please. I mentioned areas that we will not replace, and those are areas that are permitted. So, at this time we're showing you an example of what that looks like. So, on Connecticut Avenue you'll see specialty pavers that a property owner chose to install, and that it's permitted for. And then on 1880 19th Street you'll see an example of that as well of an area that already includes specialty pavers. So, if it's so decided that the BIDs choose to make this --and DDOT looking forward to the BIDs to lead that effort on our behalf. Next slide, please. So, we're going to talk a little bit about the streetscape furniture out here. First, are these curvilinear benches. This came as a suggestion from the design report'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'that we received from Downtown BID as to kind of break up the angular feel of the corridor. So, we introduced these curvilinear, curvilinear benches throughout the corridor. They're located in areas where we have these public carpets that I'll talk to about a little bit on the next slide. But the actual type of bench, you know, the materials and the shading of it is still being, it's still being coordinated. But this is to give a design on what this looks like, and we include a space for that. We do have our pretty standard benches that we're including throughout the corridor, and also the specialty bike racks that are being included along the corridor as well. Next slide, please. Okay. And so, I mentioned the public art carpets. We have about nine locations throughout the corridor where we're showing these carpet pads. And this is for the'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'BIDs, or anyone to really program the space, include art and sculpture along the corridor. Right now we're showing them along the sidewalks, 90 percent planned. But we are discussing actively about including them in the median as well. So, there will be art incorporated throughout the corridor. For this project we're showing an expanded tree box through the corridor. So, we are expanding all of the tree boxes onto the maximums possible, save for a bench or a trashcan that we run into. And then, also, we're including our more decorative light fixtures along the corridor. And then the trashcans we are showing opportunities for branding for the BIDs to include in their respective areas. Next slide, please. This is representative of the trees that we have scheduled. You can see them in the different seasons, spring and fall. This is what we're showing along the proposed street --'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'for street trees along K Street. Next slide, please. And so now I'm going to switch to the medians and what enhancements we've included there. So, I do want to point to, so, the illustration that you see here is highly illustrative from previous concepts. I do want to point out what we're actually doing here. So, we are removing existing, removing 121 existing trees. And that's mainly due to the removal of the existing medians. And we are proposing new trees, 174 trees. So, we are increasing the number of trees out here on the corridor, a net gain of 53 trees. And we're also increasing the canopy, the current tree canopy that's out there, which contributes to the 40 percent tree canopy coverage by Sustainable D.C. So, we are contributing to that goal with this project. The amount of greenspace that are, that is being enhanced, so we'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'have expanded tree pits of 8,000 square feet, greenspace that we're adding, about 36,000 square feet. And the barrier retentions are 9,000 square feet. So, all in all, we're adding upwards of 56,000 square feet of new greenspace along K Street Transitway. And how it was described to me is if you take the whole south side of the sidewalk from the project limits and made that all green, that's how much greenspace we're actually adding to K Street itself. So, just wanted to point that out to you guys. Next slide, please. Okay. Here is what the typical medians look like, the planted medians look like. At the areas where we do not have bike lanes we have these 18-foot wide medians on either side that include trees and other plantings, bioretention one side, regular planting on the other. And the bioretention is due to meeting our stormwater capture'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'goals for D.C. Next slide, please. And here we are with the illustration of where we include bike lanes here. And I see there's a layby in the middle. And we'll talk about that a little bit on in transit improvement as to why we have that there. And, again, these are older drawings we have to show that. Next slide, please. And so, again, some of what you're seeing from no bike lanes, we have bike lanes here, bioretention on one side and planting on the other. Next slide, please. Here, which are representative of the plantings that we will have out in the medians. So, trees of pretty substantial size. Again, the canopy contributing to the increase of canopy coverage along K Street Transitway. And then, also, all the different median plantings and plantings along the Transitway as well. Next slide, please. Okay. Factors that affect tree location.'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'We've heard a lot about utilities and tree conflicts, not being able to place more trees out there due to those conflicts. This drawing here is to kind of illustrate the amount of utilities that are along the corridor. We're just showing you lines here. But you can see we have telecom, we have electrical, we have gas, all kind of utilities out here. We're not showing you the widths of these and we're not showing you the depths of these. And so all I will say is that DDOT is relocating utilities where we can. But there is little to no room to move a lot of utilities. And so, to get around that and increase our tree canopy coverage, we've worked closely with our Urban Forestry Division to evaluate tolerances from the utility companies, and really push those tolerances to make sure we can get as many trees'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'in as possible, and make sure that they are viable. And I think with that close coordination with the utilities and with our Urban Forestry Division we were able to get in a lot more trees than we previously realized. Next slide, please. Okay. Although it's our multi-modal improvements for transit, pedestrian, and bicycles. Next slide. Again, we want to provide safe, efficient travel for bus riders, cyclists, and pedestrians, and motorists. And I'll go through some slides to show you how we're trying to achieve that. Next slide. Okay. So, transit here. For our transit facilities we have 11-foot wide platforms, 2-inch curbs for near level boarding. The platforms are large enough to accommodate two articulated buses. They are granite curbs. And we already talked of the warning surfaces. And then the poured-in-place concrete does have that variation to light gray and light gray that tie into the sidewalks'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'themselves. You will notice that we're showing shelters here. But in our 90 percent plans we actually are not showing shelters there. We show the space for them. We show power for them. The shelters have been moved to another phase of this project. Next slide, please. For transit improvement and accessible, accessible pedestrian signals will include areas for wayfinding at the sidewalks. We have median tips for protection of pedestrians, and those particular warning surfaces, and transit signals along the corridor where needed. Next slide. Here I want to show a little bit about what's all happening with the buses and transit along the corridor. So, we do have four new bus stops, 11 Metrobus and Circulator routes. And they're all coming in and out of corridors at various locations. I do want to call your attention to 19th Street where we have four different bus lines that are'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'needing to exit the Transitway. And then in different locations there are buses entering the transitway. But 19th Street, I'm calling that to attention to bring up later. Next slide. Here K Street Transitway is part of a larger bus, downtown bus priority network. Our Transit Delivery Division and WMATA have been in very close coordination with developing this network. And K Street Transitway is the input into that bus priority network that's being planned. The different colors here that are active, K Street Transitway down the center, which is highlighted. That's in blue. 11th Street, N.W. is an active project. And then what's complete are H and I Street, those couplets there. And in the future, we'll see at 18th and 19th, Connecticut Avenue, 14th Street, 13th Street, so you'll see a lot of future connections being planned for this area that will come online in time. And then,'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'you know, some of the ways for K Street Transitway to come along before those get implemented. So, you'll see K Street has an input to this bus priority network. Next slide, please. Okay. As far as transit operations goes, we do have one area now at 19th Street where we're showing a left turn. So, we were able to eliminate a left turn at 21st Street. Only Circulator was using that. And they now changed their operations flow to eliminate that left turn, and add more greenspace there. At 19th, that left turn is needed and to make sure we re-map the routes that need to exit the transit lane at that intersection. And this allows a more efficient bus operation. And it moves those left turn buses out of the way of the through-buses, that allows them to get immediately to their destination. Then we're showing the laybys'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'on the bottom half of this. And so, this is an older illustration. And the 90 percent plan does not update it there either. But it will be updated in the 100 percent design. Those laybys, those are not for bus pull-offs. Those are for maintenance vehicles to access the platforms, to service the platforms. And in the 100 percent design you will see those laybys moved more closely to the platforms, so that we're not breaking up the greenspace in between the platforms and these laybys. So, there's only one layby at each one of those stop locations. And it's only wide enough for one vehicle, will be wide enough for one vehicle, and that's just for service vehicles, not for bus pull-ins or pull-offs. Next slide. Yes. Pedestrian and bicycle improvements along the corridor. High visibility crosswalks, improved sidewalks, protected bike lanes on either side of the, of'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'the Transitway. We have the two-stage turn boxes. You'll notice that there are, we're showing less turn boxes with this 100 percent design to 90 percent design. This is in accordance with NHTSA guidance to provide turn boxes at areas where we have either planned or existing bike lanes. We've also walked -- or sat down with WABA and walked through the corridor intersection by intersection to really plan out where we have these turn boxes and, actually, what safety improvement is being incorporated into the project to make sure that we are providing the best infrastructure for the bicycle improvement. We have high visibility crossing markings, and then exclusive bike signals on the areas where there's conflict. Next slide, please. And so, now I just want to show you some renderings. You may have seen this from the CFA presentation. We have the existing at 13th Street looking east.'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'And the next slide is a rendering of that viewshed again, with the Transitway. Next slide, please. We have 19th Street looking west here, existing. And then the next slide will show you the rendering of the Transitway. And, again, those shelters are shown here now, but those will move to another phase of this project to allow for more discussion on those. Next slide, please. So, now we'll go into next steps and our remaining timeline. So, we are completing final design in December. We will have an additional public meeting between now and December to talk through the final design and continue to meet with other stakeholders throughout. And then construction we will begin in late summer/fall of 2023. Next slide. Okay. So, our construction plan, we're still going through our phasing for construction. And we plan to have that developed at the end of the project. And'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': 'we do understand the sensitivities of, you know, the impacts of construction and trying to, you know, revitalize the downtown core. And so, that will be taken into consideration as we thoughtfully plan out our construction and phasing of that to reduce the impacts that property owners feel along the corridor. So, we'll update people as we go along with, with our DDOT construction projects, projected updates, and the traffic advisories. And then pedestrian access to businesses, residential crosswalks, will always be prioritized, and make sure that it's safely accessible. And I believe that's the end of the presentation. Ask for any questions.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'Thank you, Ms. Jackson. Before we conclude today's presentation we have several initial staff comments on the project that I just want to run through really quickly before we open it up to Commission deliberation. And these comments, really, are reflective of comments that we received from the Golden Triangle BID, the Downtown BID, and the Coalition for Smarter Growth. As some context, this project comes at a critical time when the downtown area and other business districts are facing great uncertainty, with increasing rates of teleworking, consolidation of office space, and a surge in office-to-residential conversions. And these factors will have long-term implications for the K Street area. And in response, this project is an opportunity to recreate K Street for the future as a truly great place where workers, visitors, and residents can enjoy participating in urban life. So, therefore, we encourage DDOT to do everything possible to'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'create a continuous tree canopy and robust landscaping as a new, complete corridor space, which not only includes a multi-modal facility, but the sidewalk space should be included as part of a new linear park, as envisioned in the 2004 NCPC Downtown BID charrette. And it sounds like the project design is well underway to achieving that goal. We urge the use of high quality streetscape materials, transit shelters, and furnishings that would be consistent with the new K Street design as a destination and premier civic space. While we do understand the project includes the replacement of some sidewalk pavers, the K Street reconstruction does present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to not only reimagine the parkway space, which the current project does, but the project should also reimagine the adjacent sidewalk space with the same boldness. And, finally, we encourage DDOT to continue working with the local BIDs, Commission on'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'Fine Arts, NCPC, District Office of Planning, and other stakeholders to ensure the project accomplishes its goal of transforming the city's downtown area. And with that, that concludes my presentation. Again, we have Ms. Jackson and two other DDOT representatives with us here today who are available for questions and comments by the Commission. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Mr. Weil. And thank you, Ms. Jackson. Do Commissioners have any questions for either Mr. Weil or Ms. Jackson?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' I have a couple questions.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' All right. Thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' So, can you gauge for me how all-in WMATA is on this? Because a lot of the utility of this is really dependent on moving all those 30 buses off of H and I Street and moving them up to K Street. So, they are comfortable with the location stops, the turn radius that they need, all of that to, essentially, make a pretty big design shift in a couple of their routes?'",
        "'MS. JACKSON': ' Yes, they are. And the allowance was planned in coordination with WMATA and their needs, even the turn radius and what they need. And we're still in coordination with them on these things, and addressing those comments in 90 percent. But they, they're totally onboard.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Any other questions? (No response.)'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Well, I'll just comment, Ms. Jackson. I appreciate the thorough presentation. I was really struck by the very colorful utility map that you shared, and understanding some of the challenges you have in trying to accomplish all of these goals in the corridor. At this time I'd love to open it up for discussion. If everyone could please turn on your cameras, I'll start with Commissioner Cash. Then we'll go in round robin format using our normal seating order. So, Commissioner Cash, any further comments for this?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Just a few comments. So, I just wanted to let you know that I think that the Downtown BID was -- the Downtown and Golden Triangle BIDs were pretty instrumental in kicking all of this off. The idea that they're seeing, essentially, 90 percent and they still have outstanding concerns or questions on collaboration, I would hope that you sit down with them to address those concerns, because I think a lot of them are valid, just as far as access to businesses, and the recovery, and all of that. So, I would just hope that before a shovel goes in the ground that you've got the BIDs onboard, because I think they're a really important partner in making sure this gets off the ground. So, that's comment number one. My comment number two, I appreciate the attention to the trees in the presentation and what the plans are for'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'it. I know Urban Forestry is very thoughtful about this stuff. But I would really urge you all, as much as you can when you're ripping out these old, kind of nicely mature trees and getting ready to put new ones in, that you give a lot of attention, especially in the tree boxes that are going to be between the transit lane and the travel lanes, making sure you dig all that old crappy soil out of there. I mean, this is an opportunity, you're tearing up the road, that you make some nice big tree boxes with fresh soil. Because I think that a lot of the street trees that we have, the reason they don't last is because we just pop a new tree and there's some pretty ugly dirt. So, I just urge you to work closely with Urban Forestry and make sure that we realize'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'this is, yes, it's a transit lane, but for a lot of people that live downtown -- I happen to be one of them -- all those trees are just a really great amenity when you're walking down those wide sidewalks. I think the trees are just really important. And one other thing I just want to throw out there. I don't know if you've gotten this far in the design yet, but this is going to be a pretty complicated transitway when it comes to pedestrians, now bikes, now buses that are making left turns when other ones aren't. It seems like it's going to be a lot of pretty intricate signalization that you're going to have to do along here. And the renderings that I've seen just seem to have, like, oh, a little traffic light kind of like it has right now. But I imagine, just like'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'on the 16th Street bus lanes, when you get up to 16th and U there's these special now bus signals that look very different. And it looks like there's going to need to be a lot of complicated signalization. So, as you're designing that, I'd really urge you to take into account how that impacts the pedestrian experience, the safety for drivers. I think that you could quickly, very quickly clutter up the limited poles that you're going to have in this space. And just the last point I want to make with regards to my question on WMATA. I think that the WMATA involvement and consultations are incredibly important. We just, I know we just completed the 16th Street bus lanes. They're not completed, at least in downtown. We painted them and a month later other changes the District has made with 16th Street with Black Lives Matter Plaza'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'has caused a bunch of re-routing. And now we have two or three blocks of red-painted lanes going down 16th Street to K Street that are not actually used by buses. So, to the extent that we get all that stuff programmed and figured out really on the front end so that we don't have things like stubbed lanes or something like that, or have to go back and repaint a bunch of stuff, I just think that making sure we've got that down pat before we put shovels in the ground and completed this is just really important to make sure that we get this off the ground as quickly as we can. So, that's my thoughts. But thanks so much for your presentation.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Commissioner Davis.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' No additional comments from me, thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Ginsberg.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GINSBERG': ' Also no comment. Thank you for the presentation.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cozart.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'Yes. I want to thank the presenters, and also thank our NCPC staff. I just want to appreciate and align with the comments that you made on this. And appreciate you for coming to share the current informational basis. Also, we in the Office of Planning have heard from Golden Triangle BID, and Coalition for Smarter Growth, and Downtown BID as well. And so, in many ways I think that's a signal of their interests, but also to offer a stewardship, especially as it relates to the sidewalk areas. And while I fully understand and appreciate a big part of this and a big driver of this is what happens curb to curb, the sidewalk pieces are really important. So, just encourage you guys to continue to think creatively about how to make this real. The next steps and continued partnership with those BIDs as you go forward. Really I'm'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'just picking up on Commissioner Cash's comment about this. And I think in many ways our takeaway is that the current design really establishes the proper grounds that can accommodate those future enhancements. It's all about making real on the promise of that. Right? And so, appreciate that you guys have made space for that and done nothing to curtail those opportunities. Now it's really about making sure that moving into construction as what happens curb to curb there can be more of that conversation about kind of creative uses and other things that can happen, particularly in the sidewalk space. And just appreciate and commend your ongoing work. It's a big balancing act, like Chair White was saying, especially just with the utilities themselves, a big balancing act. Appreciate the way you've expanded the design conversation to make sure we're really talking deeply about sustainability and bringing in all'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'the voices. So, thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah. I don't have a lot of comments. I appreciate getting the update. I was wondering what was happening with this project because it's been ongoing for so long, and has gone through many iterations and had very many interactions with the Park Service. I do appreciate the fact that the project will steer clear of any impacts on our squares downtown, which is critically important from our perspective. But I also appreciate the fact that, you know, something is finally moving forward. And it's the emphasis is on people and moving people. And, hopefully, you know, you'll work through all of the remaining issues with the BIDs and being able to implement this project soon. It will be a transformative project. Hopefully, it will all be for the good. But it will be transformative, no doubt about it. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Commissioner McMahon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thank you. I appreciate DDOT's and staff's presentations today. Very interesting. A lot of work, I know, between people over the years has gone into this concept. Looking forward to it moving forward. I have no other comments.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Argo. You're on mute, Commissioner Argo.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Well, there you go. I appreciate the presentation. And I'm excited about the possibilities and envisioning what this, to use that term again, that transformative, this transformative plan will look like. Thank you for sharing it with us. We appreciate it.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Wright.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I have no comments.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' Thank you. Commissioner Dixon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Transformable. Go forward. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. Well, once again, Ms. Jackson, thank you so much for being here. And thank you to you and your colleagues at DDOT in trying to work collaboratively with everyone to achieve a lot of different goals in that corridor. I think you heard people are really focused on all the different details. And I particularly want to thank Commissioner Cash for bringing up something that is so simple yet so important in terms of replacing the trees that everyone sees as a fixture. And just, you know, being mindful of all of those details and what that environment will be like. And I also appreciate what Commissioner May said: the focus is on moving people, not vehicles. So, it's clear you're thinking through all those things. And I know Commissioner Cozart is working very hard on this with you, because it's such a high priority. And'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': 'I was particularly interested to see the iteration of ideas of what the mode, the dominant mode of transit would be through that corridor and what the current thinking is. So, appreciate your presentation. So, with that, are there any other comments or questions from the Commission? (No response.)'",
        "'CHAIR WHITE': ' If not, thank you again for the great presentation and the good staff work on this. This concludes our open session agenda. Our next regular Commission meeting will be held on Thursday, November 3rd at 1:00 p.m. And if there is no other business to come before the Commission, the session is now adjourned.'"
