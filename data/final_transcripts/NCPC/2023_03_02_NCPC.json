The applicant also provided proposed Transportation Demand Management Strategies, or TDM strategies, to limit single -occupancy vehicle trips. These include expanding telework for administrative employees, increasing carpool or vanpool u se, implementing an expanded USDA shuttle bus service from the Greenbelt Metro, and on-site bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and supportive improvements to the bicycle infrastructure in Prince George's County. Telework for administrative employees is a significant TDM strategy used to improve the parking ratio. Also, administrative employees are more capable of using public transportation because their start and end times fall within normal WMATA operating hours.

The U.S. Green Building Council tells us bird-friendly strategies help building owners, and there is no incidental operating cost to making a building bird -friendly. On the contrary, the strategies can save on operating and energy costs, especially when these types of strategies are incorporat ed into the initial design phase, rather than after - the-fact.

They don't see an engagement or a connection to what the future has for them. Getting them engaged and getting them to understand how it's them to be there and do it -- if you're on Connecticut Avenue and you have a meeting, people are going to show up, even if they're renters, because they understand what it means. But I won't go on. I got a lot of feelings about this, and it's interesting that we are concerned about trying to protect land for use by communities that are there. In Anacosti a, for east of the river, we have the park, Anacostia Park. I've been trying for multiple years now to get some attention on that. It's moving forward now. Well, time is running.'",

You gotta find out how you can t alk about what tools you can use to make it work for them so they don't have to be pushed out. And I think that may be out of our control.

So the more you can illuminate history by giving examples , not just pointing at -- illustrating cause and effect.

So what you're learning from these focus groups is incredibly timely. Excited to be involved going forward. I think there may be some opportunities for our Executive Director reports to reflect so me of this history on various sites, and that could be one way, to Commissioner Wright's point, of educating folks publicly. Also excited for opportunities where NCPC may be exploring ways to look at this at a bigger level, sets of panel discussions and o ther things that would be a part of that. And we're 215 NEAL R.

I think Commissioner Wright was correct in pointing out that we need to face certain things abo ut the history of planning in the District of Columbia and be direct about it and where we can make changes to try to address those sorts of things. Sometimes they're small, like how things are named, and sometimes they're very big, like the erasure of en tire neighborhoods, which have occurred with the blessing of this Commission in its past. It's not easy to address these things, but I think it's important to be able to do some of those things. 217 NEAL R.

There's no mass transit to that location. So we're immediately picking winners and losers. And I think that those are the kin ds of things -- if we want to put teeth into the work that we do, we have to look at all of those barriers to prosperity, whether it's housing, whether it's a job and income, whether it's transportation, whether it's engagement in our community and our sch ools.
