Okay, so, the National, the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation, has submitted a site selection study for the Fallen Journalists Memorial for the Commission to review and comment. Let me quickly review what the Commemorative Works Act, the CWA, is. The federal law directs NCPC to review and approve the site and design for commemorative works located on federal land in Washington, D.C. or its environs. Originally passed in 1986, the law has been amended several times, including in 2003 when Congress established the Reserve, an area in the National Mall where no new memorials are permitted. The intent of the CWA is to preserve the integrity of the L'Enfant and McMillan Plans and maintain open space in Washington. The map here shows the Reserve in orange, the cross axis of the Mall, as well as Area I in yellow, and Area'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'II. Area I is reserved for memorials deemed to be of preeminent historical and lasting significance. They are not defined precisely within the CWA. And just a quick reminder of the required criteria outlined in the CWA for site and design approval. This includes locating the work in surroundings that are relevant to the subject, and in a location that does not interfere with an existing work. The location should also protect open space and existing public views, as well as cultural and national resources. Next I'll present a quick overview of the site selection and design review process of memorials. The Commemorative Works Act provides a framework for memorial authorization, siting, and design for lands under the control of NPS or GSA in Washington, D.C. After Congress authorized the memorial on federal lands, and the president signs the bill into law, memorial sponsors must gain site and design approval'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'from NCPC and the Commission on Fine Arts, CFA. The National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, NCMAC, starts the site selection process before NCPC formally reviews the site and design. NCMAC has an advisory role over commemorative works, where CFA and NCPC have approval authority over site and design of the memorials. We are at the beginning of the review for the Fallen Journalists Memorial. At the site selection review step, as you see in the yellow box, today the Commission is weighing the challenges and opportunities of each site. After these comments, the applicant will develop memorial designs within the preferred site or sites. In the future, the site and memorial designs will return to our Commission for preliminary and final approval. And with that I'll list the submission. In 2020, under Public Law 116-253, Congress authorized the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation to build a commemorative work in Washington, D.C.'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'to commemorate America's commitment to a free press by honoring journalists who have sacrificed their lives through service to that cause. Public Law 117-328 allows this memorial to be located within Area I that I showed in the previous slide. The program of the memorial is to advance the goals of commemoration, education, and inspiration. The Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation envisions that the memorial will include an outdoor site with commemorative features and other elements, such as a plaza, benches, or interpretive signage. These physical elements will be supported by online educational information. The memorial will serve as a family place of reflection, a convening place, and a place that serves as an attraction. The site selection study includes a series of criteria developed by the sponsor to identify a suitable location for the memorial. This includes program suitability, thematic nexus, universal accessibility, site prominence and visibility, independence, site availability,'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'transportation access, tranquility, and infrastructure. Here are prominent government and journalism locations in Washington, D.C., that the applicant provided as a point of reference. As you see, they are located just north of the Mall, as well as towards the east. The project team created an existing memorial thematic cluster map showing that the public service memorials and museums are emerging on the east side of the National Mall, shown in the pink dashed circle on the map. Project team identified 24 sites in the initial inventory, as shown in the map on the screen, which includes locations within and outside of Area I, as well as a site in upper Northwest D.C., which you see in the lower left. The team analyzed the sites based on the identified criteria, after ruling out those sites under the Architect of the Capitol's jurisdiction, highlighted in gray. The sites were eliminated based'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'on their availability and ability to satisfy the criteria, moving from the left to the right in order of priority. After the suitability and nexus were assessed, universal accessibility left four viable sites for further study. Next we'll share the assessments of the four identified viable sites. Again, looking at program suitability, thematic nexus, universal accessibility, independence, site availability, transportation access, tranquility, and infrastructure suitability, and again showing if located within the Area I, and from highest priority to lowest priority. Here are the four sites mapped out. It's to note that in 2001 the Memorial and Museums Master Plan, 2M Plan, provides guidance regarding the placement of future commemorative works. The sites currently under consideration, except for Site O on Maryland and Independent Avenue, are identified as sites 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': '22 for memorials within the 2M Plan. Some conditions have changed and we are noting where there are discrepancies, and that NCPC is currently updating the 2M Plan. Three sites are located within Area 1, one is located in Area II. And now, on to site specifics. th Site A is located between 13 and th 14 Streets along Pennsylvania Avenue. It's roughly .28 acres, and it's located within the area line. Some advantages are the circulation and access for pedestrians that is generally safe and easily accessible. It's also highly visible in a visible location within the urban core. The site presents practical issues, including the relocation of the General Pulaski statue. In addition, potential redevelopment resulting Initiative memorial. from could the compPennsylvania licate this Avenue site as a Here are the thematic points for Site A. There are multiple competing themes represented on the site. And the Fallen'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'Journalists connection to Washington's historic Newspaper Row is not inherently strong and would need additional interpretive signage. Again, because of the practical issues with the site, staff recommends the applicant dismiss the site from further consideration. Site D is located on the eastern end of the Mall near the Capitol Building. It's roughly .19 acres, being the smallest of the sites. It is also located within Area I. And, thus, the site is very constrained by existing utilities. Also, although the site is accessible on all sides, pedestrians have to cross at least six lanes of traffic to access the site, as you can see in the upper-right image. While it has a great view of the Capitol Building, the nexus with the Capitol Building and Pennsylvania Avenue are not inherently strong, and the proximity to the new memorial may lead to encroachment. We find that this site does not'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'establish enough relevant nexus to warrant this difficult redevelopment of the site constrained by existing utilities. In addition, potential redevelopment resulting from the Pennsylvania Avenue Initiative could potentially complicate the site as a memorial. Therefore, staff recommends this applicant dismiss this site from further consideration. Site O is south of the National Museum of the American Indian. It is slightly larger, at roughly .3 acres and, again, within Area I. It's advantage is the very strong thematic nexus with a clear view of the U.S. Capitol and the adjacency to the Voice of America. Combined, these two items represent the commitment to free press and honoring fallen journalists. There is also the proximity to the National Mall and visitors to Washington. This site presents an opportunity for temporary expansion of space through the occasional permanent closures of Maryland Avenue. It also has a primarily open turf with no known established'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'landscape, designed landscape. However, there is a nexus with the Capitol Building and the Voice of America Building, though it would require interpretation to relay that relationship to the public. The applicant shared additional site studies for Sites O and T. For Site O, the memorial design would likely be oriented towards the U.S. Capitol, which would be visible from most of the site. Use would likely be constrained over time due to vegetation at the U.S. Botanic Gardens across the street. The site could accommodate a central memorial area of approximately 7,000 square feet. The open turf of the site provides flexibility for the memorial design. And also, as you see in the graphic, the blue hatched area highlights the potential for special events-based expansion with the closure of Maryland Avenue. With all of that, staff supports advancing this site for further evaluation. th Site T is located between'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': '18 and th 19 Streets, N.W. Consisting of two triangular parks on either side of Pennsylvania Avenue, it is potentially the largest site with .75 acres, and a reminder that this site is located outside of Area I, within Area II. It has a thematic nexus with the well-known journalist Murrow. It also holds mature trees, which offers a very shaded setting. It does have limitations though on its location. Although along Pennsylvania, the White House, and U.S. Capitol are not visible. And it also has an existing designed landscape which could just potentially affect the flexibility of design. We find the nexus with the naming of the park Edward Murrow is strong, though it would require interpretation to relay that relationship to the public. As I mentioned earlier, Site T is made up of two triangle parcels along Pennsylvania Avenue. The memorial design would likely focus on the southwest'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'parcel, and would be oriented east down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House, although this landmark, again, would not be visible from the site. The site could accommodate a central memorial area of approximately 7,000 square feet. The site does contain the mature trees and existing design landscape. But, also, the sponsor is considering a temporary closure of H Street for permitted uses. And that you see in the blue hatch on the graphic. With all of that, staff supports advancing this site for further evaluation because of its thematic nexus and suitability for a memorial. And with that, I will go into the executive director's recommendation. I will not read word for word, but would like to highlight. As discussed earlier, due to practical issues, recommend the applicant dismiss Site A from further consideration. And regarding Site D, due to constraints around utilities especially, recommend the applicant dismiss the'",
        "'MS. LINDSJO': 'site from further consideration. We support advancing the following sites for further evaluation: Site O and Site T. The memorial sponsor, working with NPS, must determine whether one or both sites should be advanced for additional design development. Also like to note that all sites are located in important historic and cultural landscapes. Therefore, any proposed commemorative placement should minimize visual impacts to both landscapes and associated views. And with that, I will answer any questions but would also like Barbara Cochran and Paul Goldberger who would like to give a few words as the memorial sponsor.'",

Thanks to you, Madam Chairwoman, and members of the Commission for your consideration of our comments on the site selection process for the Fallen Journalists Memorial. I am the president of the Fallen Journalists Memorial foundation. And I am joined by our AECOM project team members Alan Harwood and Claire Sale, as well as Paul Goldberger, who is a consultant to the foundation on the design selection process. The staff presentation did an excellent job of summarizing the background and legislative history on the project. I want to take a moment to provide some additional context. As you are probably aware, freedom of the press is under attack both figuratively and literally across America and the world. We started the foundation on the one-year anniversary of the June 18, 2018, attack that killed five employees in the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Since then, well'",
        "'MS. COCHRAN': 'over 300 additional journalists and media workers around the world have been killed while doing their jobs, including five more here in the United States. I mention this because we believe the location of this memorial will underscore the significance in value of our national places on press freedom and those who died in service to that cause. This was the intention of Congress when it endorsed the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior to locate the memorial in Area I, the area reserved for works of preeminent and lasting historical significance. Locating this memorial where millions of visitors will readily encounter it will serve to educate and inspire vast numbers of the current and future generations about the role of the free press as a pillar of democracy. This is even more important with the closing two years ago of the museum which served that needed function. A'",
        "'MS. COCHRAN': 'location that is within view of the Capitol and close to other important government buildings underscores the place press freedom holds in the U.S. Constitution, as enshrined in the First Amendment. The founding fathers deemed a free press to be independent of and on par with our government institutions. Around the world this is a defining characteristic of American democracy. And, therefore, we believe that locating the memorial on an unattached island parcel, within close proximity to each of the three branches of government, will underscore the essential role the journalists play in holding these institutions accountable to their citizens. Thank you again for your consideration. And we welcome the opportunity to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much. And if that concludes your comments, I just want to again thank Ms. Lindsjo and also Ms. Cochran for those good and strong comments appropriately.

We go through this exercise every time. And it's just not going to make it unless you've got a presidential memorial where it's a multi-hundreds of millions of dollar budget to revamp the entire thing. It's just kind of an exercise in frustration for those of us who lived through this a hundred times. The other thing I would say, and please I want a major caveat, but I feel the need to say, GSA is undertaking what could be a significant repositioning of the portfolio. And I think the thematic relationship with the Voice of America is, of course, quite legit right now. But, and I don't want anyone to freak out because I am not saying'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'that anybody is moving, but they are not, it is not like a --it's not, it's not necessarily a timeless connection. We all thought the museum was permanent; right? So, my point being that I would take it easy on that interpretation just because -- and again I want to, I'm going to restate it to be very clear -- this is not based on any projected vacating of the Cohen Building where the Voice of America currently is, it's just an observation that over time agencies move around a bit. And I would, I would take it a little bit easy on that connection.'",

It was already done by the Memorial Advisory Commission in teeing these things up. And I appreciate Commissioner Wright's comments about that agency location's change. I mean, this is something that has come up before with other memorials based on the current location of agencies. In think in the past it had to do with agencies that were actually in rented space. This is a little different because this has been, you know, it is a legacy home, if nothing else, Voice of America. So, there is some connection there. But it's, you know, I think that the tenuous nature of some of those connections between certain organizations that are certain instances that can change over time, it's often not a great'",

        "'MR. WEBB': 'Okay, great. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Goodmann, and members of the Commission. The National Park Service on behalf of the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation has submitted a site selection study for the Global War on Terrorism Memorial for Commission review and comment in its role under the Commemorative Works Act. As Melissa just covered the Commemorative Works Act previously in her presentation, I will not repeat it here. But I will just call your attention to the areas on this map indicated as Reserve, and in Area I and Area II, as they do relate to the site selection presentation. And just a quick reminder of the required criteria outlined in the Act for site and design approval: This includes locating the work in surroundings that are relevant to the subject, and in a location that does not interfere with an existing work. The location should also'",

As Melissa also went over the CWA site selection and design review process in her presentation, for time's sake I will not repeat it again. But I will note that we are at the beginning of the review for this memorial at the site selection review step, which is in the yellow box. Today the Commission is weighing the challenges and opportunities at each site. After these comments, the applicant will develop memorial designs within the preferred sites. And in the future, the sites and memorial designs will return to our Commission for preliminary and final approval.

With the understanding that any memorial site selected in the Reserve is likely to be under half an acre in total size, the Memorial Foundation is endeavoring to fulfill its core mission principles and program objectives. The Foundation envisions a memorial that is inclusive, reverent, and apolitical, as a place of honor for all who have served and sacrificed in the ongoing Global War on Terrorism, as well as the countless civilians, family members, and others that supported them. The program objectives of the memorial include to honor, heal, empower, and to unite. For the site selection study the applicant utilized a series of criteria to identify a suitable location for the memorial. The criteria included program suitability, thematic nexus, universal accessibility, site prominence and visibility, site availability, transportation'",

These criteria were identified in the first round of evaluation to 35 potential memorial sites, including 16 sites within the Reserve, 8 sites within Area I, and 11 sites within Area II. In the first round of site evaluation analysis, 16 sites were identified for further analysis in the second round because they comply with the memorial's authorizing legislation. The other 19 potential sites were dismissed. Of the 16 sites brought forward from the first round, during the second round of evaluation 11 sites were identified as not fully suitable regarding site availability and were eliminated. And five sites were identified for further, more detailed analysis based on the criteria in this round. Following the second round, three sites were selected as the most appropriate for further analysis. Those will be circled in yellow, and they are Site A, which is Constitution Avenue and 23 Street;'",

And none of these three sites are in NCPC's Memorials and Museums Master Plan or the 2M Plan. Now let's take a closer look at the three sites for consideration, beginning with Site A. rd The Constitution Avenue and 23 Street site would place the memorial in the northern half of the long panel northeast of the Lincoln Memorial. The site would enable access to the north, south, and east. The placement would align with the visual axis of the Washington Monument, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and the future national Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial located just to the west. A strong visual connection would also be available to the Lincoln Memorial. In reviewing Site A, the site has a strong nexus with'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'other war memorials which are located near and around the Lincoln Memorial. In addition, this site occupies a prime spot on the Reserve where there is a significant representation of military themes. Furthermore, staff finds that given the cultural and select landscape of the nearby Lincoln Memorial, as well as the site's open setting, commemoration strategies in this location should consider a landscape-oriented approach that minimizes the memorial footprint and avoids significant vertical elements, and also avoids the use of large bodies of water, as shown in the studies presented in the application. These would be inconsistent with the landscape setting of the Lincoln Memorial. Staff does recommend that the Commission supports advancing Site A for further evaluation. The next proposed site is Site B at Constitution Gardens. Within Constitution Gardens the proposed memorial would be sited near the southwestern edge of Constitution Gardens' pond. Access to the site would'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'be available from the north, west, and east. And the placement would provide a visual connection with the Vietnam Women's Memorial, the Signers' Memorial, and the Washington Monument. The specific location would avoid the Vietnam Veterans Memorial/Washington Monument visual axis, as well as the flood control levee. Regarding Site T -- Site B, Constitution Gardens, the site has access to the proximity of other war memorials, but the character of the memorial may not be consistent with the more lively nature of Constitution Gardens as a place for families to gather and play. Furthermore, the desired size of the memorial has the potential to impinge upon or alter the character and setting of Constitution Gardens. Staff does note that there is a planned revitalization of Constitution Gardens which is intended to commence by 2024 and be th completed in 2026 for the 250 Anniversary of the signing of the Declaration'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'of Independence. Due to the distinct topography and distances from primary pedestrian and vehicular routes, this memorial site may not be as readily accessible or visible to visitors. Given these challenges and the consideration of other viable sites, staff recommends that the applicant dismiss the site from further consideration, given site constraints and potential to impact Constitution Gardens. The last site for review is Site J, the Potomac River site, which would place the memorial at the intersection of Ohio Drive and West Basin Drive, and would enable approach from the northwest, northeast, and southeast, as well as from the Potomac River via the water transportation landing. Visual connections would be available to Arlington National Cemetery and the Pentagon. However, aviation noise related to flights from Ronald Reagan National Airport occur along the river. For the Potomac River site, applicant studies indicate new parking in proximity to the memorial location.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'Of the three sites for the Commission to comment, this is the only site with parking changes in the studies in the presentation. For Site J, the site is more recreational in nature than the others under consideration. And the nexus with other sites of war commemoration is not clearly evident. Also, the nature of the memorial may not be consistent with the surrounding commemorative landscape, which is primarily focused on great American leaders, including Martin Luther King, Jr., President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and President Thomas Jefferson. However, of the three sites this location has the greatest potential to accommodate vertical elements and design flexibility, given its distance from other memorials and their cultural landscapes. This site is in a flood plain, which would require a creative solution for the memorial design. And staff would recommend that any proposed parking should be minimal and limited to those spaces necessary to'",

Regarding all three sites before us today, all are located in important historic and cultural landscapes, including the setting of the Lincoln Memorial. And, therefore, any proposed commemoration should minimize visual impacts to those landscapes and associated views. Staff recommends that the applicant develop a commemorative strategy that considers future needs as the event is ongoing and without a specific time frame, unlike other memorials. Staff also encourages the applicant to consider a creative commemorative strategy that does not require the literal or figurative representation of groups and individuals, and avoids the need to list specific names. And, finally, staff requests that the applicant develop one or more alternative design concepts for any sites advanced for future evaluation, including variations in scale, placement, and orientation. The next submission should provide details about the physical relationship of the memorial to'",

To conclude, staff recommends that the Commission support advancing for further exploration Site A at Constitution Avenue and rd 23 Street, N.W., and Site J, the Potomac River site. At this time staff believes that both Site A and J are viable options for further evaluation. The memorial sponsor, working with the National Park Service, must determine whether one or both sites should be advanced for additional design development. This concludes my presentation. And as I have incorporated all the recommendations, I will not repeat things here. Michael Rodriguez, the President of the Memorial Foundation would like to say a few words to the Commission now.

I have the undeserved honor of representing the GWOT Memorial Foundation today as its President and CEO. As a 21-year Army veteran with extended service on behalf of our blessed nation, I am extremely proud to be here and excited to work with every single one of you. Since 2017, the Foundation has been the organization officially designated by Congress to plan, fund, and build a memorial to our Global War on Terrorism heroes. In December 2021, Congress passed the bipartisan GWOT Memorial Location Act to authorize the construction of this memorial in the Reserve area of the National Mall. Discussion groups conducted across the country guided the choice to seek this exemption in order to build this reserve - in the Reserve area of the National'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'Mall. These discussion groups included veterans, active duty service members, faith leaders and, most important, Gold Star families. I want to take a moment to comment on the nature of the Global War on Terrorism and why the memorial matters. The term the Global War on Terrorism encompasses all kinds of terrorism operations the United States has undertaken under the 2001 authorization of use of military force. That is the legislation Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks granting the United States legal military authority to run down terrorists and their allies. nd The GWOT is nearing its 22 year. And it continues to this very day in places like Somalia, Syria, and other locations across the globe. We now exist in a country where our sons and daughters have grown up watching their parents fight a war, only to serve in that same war. I can't imagine what it would'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'be like for my father, as a Vietnam veteran, to watch me graduate airborne school and go fight the Viet Cong, any more than I can imagine what it would be like for my grandfather, who served during World War II, to watch my father complete his initial training in the Army and then go fight the Nazis or serve in the Pacific. Yet, that is exactly what occurred when I watched my son deploy to the Helmand Province in Afghanistan, the same region that both his mother and I had deployed to. He was th four years old on September 11 , 2001. That was our most difficult deployment. More than 7,000 Americans in uniform have given their lives, and more than 52,000 have been wounded. It's also worth noting that another 3,400 non-uniformed personnel have lost their lives in this war according to a Department of Labor report.'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': 'That provides us the luxury of having less than 1 percent of our nation in uniform defending 99 percent. This memorial will honor all the uniformed and non-uniformed personnel who sacrificed in this incredibly complex multi-generational conflict that has profoundly changed our country. The service and sacrifice of both have added to the blessings of freedom and liberty that we enjoy every single day. It is imperative that Gold Star family members, veterans, their families, and all the Americans who served, and are still serving, and will serve in the GWOT have a place where they can pay honor to our heroes, heal, be empowered, and unite. We have been tremendously thorough throughout our site analysis. We are looking for continuing to work with you and the National Park Service so that we may finalize the location for the National Global War on Terrorism Memorial. Thank you for your consideration.'",

I did listen in to the Commission on Fine Arts review of the site selection. So, I would associate myself with their rationale for also recommending Site A. I hope I haven't screwed up the alphabet. It's the one near the -- yes, right, okay. I thought so. But, you know, my memory is, phew. I also want to make note of the comments in the EDR which I think are, gosh, I hope people heed these remarks about being literal and insisting that names be listed. Because we've developed an iconography that's sort of paralyzed at the memorial design. And I think it's a shame that we've gotten so --we've gone so far down this rabbit hole that people feel'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'it's kind of like -- well, never mind, I won't say that. I just think it's important that we return, if you think about the most powerful memorial that we have, they are abstract and they don't necessarily allude so directly to the subject at hand. And I, I believe that those are the Washington Monument being a perfect example. When we develop memorials that are so literal, they actually, instead of expanding response to the themes that we hope will inspire reflection and inspiration, or provide inspiration, they instead sort of constrict people's interpretation. And I don't think that's what we are trying to do, especially on this one, because it's open-ended, and it's multifaceted. And this is not a simple subject. I think if you try to get literal with this, you'll blow it. So, I hope that you'll, that you'll take those comments seriously and not assume'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'that a memorial without a list of names or, you know, bas-reliefs that illustrate a scene are not -- are anything less than that is not the real deal. Okay. I'm going to stop now. But I hope you get my point.'",

        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': ' Yeah. I join Commissioner Wright's position. We'll discuss this listing of names and how it creates challenges, problems often. So, we need to watch out, stop, maybe stop doing that. I also have taken a stand historically on the Commission to be against memorials that deal with war. I think we've got too much war on the Mall already. But I think this is timely and needed. And, hopefully, it might encourage us not to have wars rather than to have wars, to try to deal with this terrorist issue up front rather than after the fact.

And I -- I just want to put on the record my concern about blocking the view of the Lincoln Memorial or interfering with that view. Because it does -- the way the image was, or the slide was shown, the memorial seems to be wanting to be placed right smack in the --a beeline to the Lincoln Memorial. But I was also struck by the proximity to the Institute of Peace and the hope that was kind of created by those two being -- being close to each other. That's all I have, thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, thank you, Commissioner Steingasser. And my comment is just to support again the great work of staff and to thank Mr. Rodriguez for his leadership in for his sacrifice, of you know, his family and his own sacrifice. And just say that I look forward to the next iteration of planning for this particular memorial. And I would like to just also agree with Commissioner Wright's statement, because this war unfortunately continues. And so there's no way we could begin to list names unfortunately of all and do that in a way that did justice to their sacrifice. So that's my comment. Are there any other comments or questions? Hearing none, I --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Well, I actually did have a question, and I should probably know this. But given -- given recent reports that domestic terror is a -- is a fearful thing, or a thing to be afraid of, how -- are there plans to consider that in this memorial?'",
        "'MR. RODRIGUEZ': ' I'll jump in here and talk about that. Thank you, Commissioner Wright, for bringing that forward. You know, our focus is really to honor everyone that served and stepped forward to fight. And you know, should that and certain organizations do, and the men and women in this nation are protected, then you know, I think the beautiful opportunity that presents us with building this piece of public art, just like any art, it's open to interpretation and acceptance. We were seeking to build the most broad, diverse, and inclusive war memorial that is out there. So I hope that answers your question, Commissioner Wright.'",

At its last -- at our last meeting, the Commission postponed action until additional information could be provided by NCPC's General Counsel. I want to note that there will not be a staff presentation today, nor any additional public testimony, both of which were provided last month. So I'd like to ask Anne Schuyler, NCPC's General Counsel, to provide remarks. And following that, I'll ask for a motion and a second so that we can then begin Commission deliberations. I know that we also have NCPC staff and representatives from BEP here today and available if there are any other questions. So as we proceed, they are available too as resources.

Specifically, NCPC has advisory -- has advisory review authority over acquisition of lands in the environs unless the acquisition is specifically approved by law. The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 provided the Secretary of Agriculture with discretionary authority to transfer jurisdiction of 100 acres of land at the Beltsville Agricultural Reserve Center, or BARC, to the Secretary of Treasury. The purpose of the transfer was to allow Treasury to establish a new Bureau of Engraving and Printing facility on the property. In the case at hand, the Commission was divested of its advisory authority to review the transfer of jurisdiction at the time the Agricultural Improvement Act became law. This interpretation is consistent with the language of the Planning Act, which I noted conveys authority to'",

We have those letters from City of Greenbelt and the Anacostia Watershed Community Advisory Committee and others. From Ms. Patricia Jackman of New Carrollton in opposition. And then in the support of it we had the Vansville Citizens Association, the Commission, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and Greater Beltsville.

        "'MS. SCHUYLER': ' No. Well, the reason, I suspected this issue would come up, the legal question there is a transfer of jurisdiction and acquisition. And I believe in the context of federal government land ownership's characteristics, it is. Because essentially all land is owned by the Government of the United States of America, and then what happens is the party or the entity that takes possession of the land and has essentially all the characteristics of ownership does in fact acquire those rights and entitlements through the transfer of jurisdiction. So you have the party who acquires jurisdiction acquiring I think what I would view as they're acquiring the site.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, okay, I'm not sure that really answered my question. I mean, I think I just wanted to make this point that, you know, for example the Park Service cannot transfer jurisdiction to another federal agency, nor can we receive jurisdiction from another federal agency without law, except within the District of Columbia. That's the only place where we have that discretionary authority. Maybe other agencies have a discretionary authority where they can, you know, there is some innate authority on their part to transfer amongst themselves or to and from certain agencies, but it's going to be specific to the agency I guess. But for us specifically, you know, NCPC doesn't have a role in our transfers of jurisdiction outside of the city, unless they have to be authorized by law.'",
        "'MS. SCHUYLER': ' From a legal -- I'm sorry. Commissioner May, from a legal perspective, I dispute that. What I'm saying is that the Commission has advisory authority over land acquisitions outside the District of Columbia. Transfer of jurisdiction is a mechanism for a federal agency to acquire a site. Therefore, NCPC would be looking at that transfer of jurisdiction. I think this is a matter that you're going to hear more about not so much, and I see Mr. Acosta has turned on his camera, not so much from the perspective of legal, but in terms of procedure and processes going forward. Mr. Acosta?'",

        "'MS. SCHUYLER': ' Correct, correct.'",
        "'MR. ACOSTA': ' I think that's what he was saying. Or maybe --'",
        "'MS. SCHUYLER': ' Oh, I misunderstood. My apology.'",
        "'MR. ACOSTA': ' Yeah, there may be other agencies that have a different type of authority to transfer. We wouldn't look at those types of things unless again the Planning Act made it very clear that we do not have the authority to review what Congress has engaged in the transfer of jurisdiction or any other type of purchase approval.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Commissioner May, did you have some other comment?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, if I could, just I think this sort of highlights one of the really important aspects of planning that's undertaken by the NCPC, which is location decisions. And --'",
        "'MS. SCHUYLER': ' Correct.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Simply become a matter of an agency's ability to persuade the Congress, I think the Congress doesn't necessarily get the benefit of the holistic planning thinking that it has charged NCPC with undertaking. So I don't know that anything can be done about that, but it seems to me that decisions like this sometimes fall short because the thinking that goes into it doesn't take advantage of just good planning practices. It becomes a matter of solely politics. Of course, not that we should get to decide it. But I think that the Congress would benefit from the advice of this commission.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. A question from Commissioner Wright.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'It's not a question. It's really a comment in the -- in the same vein. I just, this whole -- for me it wasn't a question of the jurisdiction for the transfer or any of that. It's the same as Mr. May has just outlined. That a decision was made Congress in the way -- in the wayback machine long ago without a serious look by land use professionals is to me extremely unfortunate. Because now as a result, we have an industrial facility landing in the middle of an agricultural preserve, in effect. And that just doesn't make sense. I understand and I have always understood that that ship has sailed. But I think it's up to the Commission to make sure that it doesn't happen again. And I'm not sure that's not simply - -that it's not a legal issues as much as it's a communication and a'",

        "'MS. SULLIVAN': ' Yes, I just wanted to echo what Commissioner May and Commissioner Wright just said, that it is I think essential for us to have really good outreach with applicants very, very early in the process. Because you know, site selection studies evaluations are going on, and they should be coming to the Commission. And we're going to build upon our annual outreach efforts that I think have been very successful in making sure that they're aware that this stuff needs to come in to'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, thank you very much, Ms. Sullivan. And I see Commissioner Hewlett.'",

We should be consulted, because the land planners have expertise, a certain expertise. And the uses do seem incongruous. So that's what's so important to me, and that is why -- but that necessitated a look, a delve into the legal authority to see whether or not we had any flexibility at this late date. And at the end of the last meeting, it was not clear. That is why we had to have that continuance, just to see. Because if we had that flexibility, maybe there was something we could have done about it in this late date. But we, as our General Counsel has opined, we do not have that flexibility. So I think they have to be viewed in tandem. And I'",

It will come back before us. I am very, very adamant about the wastewater not including the Beaver Dam. We were assured that it would not. I want that to be accurate that that never happens. I want to, you know, they talked about LEED Silver. I want us to really explore, I want them to really explore the Gold. Why shouldn't we have LEED Gold, particularly in an environment like that?

        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I think Commissioner Hewlett really did a good job of summarizing the issues that remain before us or the concerns that we have to express at this point. You know, especially the, you know, the things like the LEED level, which, you know, it's -- I mean, saying that you're going to meet LEED Silver is like saying hey, we're going to build a building, right. It's just, it carries very little weight at this point. So I think striving for better is really what we need to emphasize. So I don't want to belabor all the points, but I made a bunch of points at the last meeting, I think it's the same. It's the same issue that, you know, we emphasized then. Has this project been implemented?'",

And it occurs to me that we, you know, that we need to take a broader, deeper look at some of the process issues and authority issues that we've been discussing here in relation to this project. And I can be more specific. I don't have to be right now, but maybe at a, you know, after the meeting at some point. I think it's a big deal.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yeah, perhaps at our retreat this summer we can cover this. I agree, process is critical. So thank you, Commissioner Argo. Yes, Commissioner Hewlett?'",

And look forward to I guess potentially this summer discussing it.

And the best design in the world can't overcome this site. Having said that, I had a question about the sections and this -- and since we don't have it in front of us I'm going on memory, so please forgive me. There's a section that shows the interior of the main production room, I think. And my question has to do with the amount of height that is still -- oh, thanks --that is still, again, my recollection is dim on this, but I want to say it was at least 25 feet over the machinery. And I -- I'm trying to --like I just want this building to disappear. So I'm assuming but I'd like somebody'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'to tell me, that you -- that you've minimized the clearance above the equipment as much as you possibly can. My assumptions are that you probably need room for ventilation and for -- maybe for repairs to be made, but I don't know. Can somebody tell me -- give me that assurance that it's as -- that this building is as low to the ground as it can possibly be?'",
        "'MR. RUOCCO': 'Yes, Commissioner Wright, thank you for your comment. Joseph Ruocco here with SOM. And we should state that this is purely driven by the clearances required overhead for these very large digital presses. That's the first point. The second point is in the center hall, the long span requires a very deep structural section. And the main hall is really quite large, given the need to print the currency projected over the next decades, which is 360 x 720 feet. So that's one large volume. There are columns in between, but they are very long spans, 130 feet. And the structural section that you see here, it's an 11-foot deep section, and all the MEP infrastructure is floating or distributed within that plenum. Now, I should state that exterior elevations, and if you look at to the left or to the right, the right where the admin and lab space'",
        "'MR. RUOCCO': 'is, that is the southern elevation. So as you're driving along Powder Mill Road and entering the facility, due to the topography, one never sees the mass of the building. That's been proven through the view sheds that we've presented to you all. But when you do approach the building, you're looking at a height of approximate 38 feet. Now, in this diagram on the west elevation, this is the most publicly accessible view as you're driving along Edmonston Road, either north to south from Powder Mill, or south to north. And what's interesting is because we're balancing the cut and fill on this 104-acre site, which by the way, Commissioner Hewlett, 92 acres are all heavily vegetated. So essentially, 88% of this campus is heavily vegetated with natural trees or natural meadow grasses. But back to the building height. In this elevation you can see because the cut and'",

And one never sees this along Edmonston Road. The -- if we go around to the north end of the building, which is where the Vansville neighborhood is, if we look at that north elevation, you can see the berm continues at the northwest corner. This is where we have a standoff of roughly 740 feet from the back of the building to the closest home along Odell Road. And that is naturally planted right now with a natural forest stand. And the plan is to reforest that northern section of the entire campus such that one, and again, we have view shed corridors, one will not be able to see that. We've interrogated this in the winter time when'",
        "'MR. RUOCCO': 'the leaves have fallen, as well as in the summertime. And there's that natural buffer, and we're taking advantage of that. The whole plan was to consolidate footprint to maximize the setback for security reasons, but also for privacy and in deference to the -- to the neighbors.'",

You are, again, landing like a spaceship in the middle of a natural habitat for a wide array, we heard a lot about birds and we've heard a lot about plants. But I would urge you to think very carefully and work with your landscape architect to plant deer-resistant plants. Because the next thing we're going to hear about is, you know, the deer are doing this and the deer are doing this. And we as human beings so often forget that we love to hate the deer for eating our hosta, but we're taking -- here's a very, very clear case in point where we are going to be reducing habitat for them.

The site is located on Sheridan Avenue in the center of Joint Base Myer- Henderson Hall in Fort Myer, Virginia. As this is a concept review, the focus of today's presentation and analysis is to receive Commission comments and feedback prior to preparation of a more detailed preliminary submission. In this case, the focus of the review is understanding the appropriateness of the project for the site and context, understanding any particularly unique or complex issues that need to be addressed, and identifying any identifying any stakeholders that may need to be further involved.

The Commission provided comments on the concept review of the Army's draft master plan for the joint base at the February Commission meeting. The draft master plan included an addendum for the proposed Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing Barracks Project. Myer-Henderson Hall is a 272-acre base that is home to several Army and U.S. Marine units, including the headquarters for the joint base, command battalion, and U.S. Marine Corps, as well as the U.S. Army Band, The Old Guard, the Rader U.S. Army Clinic, and A Company, or the Commander-in-Chief's Guard.

However, after the draft master plan was completed in 2021, the Army determined they were over 200 housing units short and developed the barracks addendum. Through the project development process, the proposed site was selected, as highlighted here. This side shows the proposed barracks project overlaid on the historic district boundaries at Fort Myer. The yellow line is the Fort Myer national landmark historic district boundary. The blue line is one of the areas determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places' expansion of the Fort Myer historic district.

The Program Comment is intended to balance historic preservation requirements with the Army's responsibility to provide quality housing for military members and their families. The Program Comment outlines the process by which the Army can demolish certain buildings as part of their Section 106 responsibility. The proposed barracks site was chosen as the preferred option because the buildings proposed for demolition, while historic, are outside the historic district. The pool and pool facilities have been closed for some time with no plans to reopen. And the quarters on Sheridan are a style already represented in the historic district. The existing site includes several non-commissioned officers' quarters on Sheridan Avenue, a pool that's been closed for several years, a large open space, and Schoolhouse Road, that connects between Sheridan Avenue and McNair Road.

South of the buildings, the Applicant is proposing a 65-space parking lot for the two buildings. As noted, the Applicant is proposing a parking lot of 65 spaces as part of the overall site plan. The joint base does not have an updated transportation management plan with updated parking information. In addition, the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan does not include a recommended parking ratio for residential uses, and instead suggests that staff use industry best practices for residential parking, which results in ranges across the board.

Regardless of the owner's requirements for new construction, the base has a significant number of surface parking lots that appear under-utilized, many in close proximity to the proposed site. And without updated base parking information, the proposed parking seems excessive. As such, staff finds the Applicant did not submit sufficient information to justify the additional surface parking lot in an area that already has significant surface parking and requests the Applicant submit the following information as part of their next submission: the number of parking spaces on the installation, the number of people living and working on the installation, and any additional information regarding campus parking usage relevant to the'",

Additional details on tree removal and replacement will be required as the project moves forward. The current landscape plan, while sparse, includes plantings around the proposed parking lot, along the central walkway and courtyards, and in the bioretention areas.

The Applicant included two variations of the building styles noted as building A and building B in the submission. Both buildings now include a gabled roof on the front and rear of the north and south extensions with half-circle windows. A soldier course of stone was added as an expression line in the masonry above the second-floor windows, and a decorative brick inset was added above and below the first and second floor windows, connecting them vertically. Building A was -- has gabled dormer windows in the roof and'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'a flat roof porch topped with white fencing at the rear -- at the front entry and both rear entries. Building B has a shed style -- has shed style roof dormers at the roof level and shed style sloped roof on the front and rear porches. The Applicant has indicated they included both styles, as they are still evaluating which one is best for the site. Staff finds the proposed architecture, while improved from the master plan review, lacks fenestration and materiality that is complementary to the Fort Myer National Historic District and recommends that the Applicant update the architecture with more details that are compatible with the design vocabulary of the Fort Myer National Historic District. This is a rendering of building A from the northwest. This is a rendering of building B from the southwest. This is rendering of the east side of both buildings. The Applicant'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'has also provided view analysis of the proposal. Included here a a are before and after views of the proposed barracks at two locations on Sheridan Avenue and a section view from east to west. This includes views of the proposed barracks from McNair Road and immediately to the east of the buildings. This concludes my presentation. I have incorporated recommendations throughout the presentation so I will not read them again. I have included them here for your reference. Overall, the Commission supports the concept plan, but there are several areas of concern that are noted in the recommendations that will need to be addressed before the next submission. Thank you, and I'm available to answer any questions you may have. Paul White and his team from the Army Corps of Engineers are also here to answer questions. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' And thank you, Ms. Herr, thank you very much. And I also want to thank those from the Army Corps of Engineers who are here to answer any questions. So I would like to ask if commissioners have questions right now for either Ms. Herr or any of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers staff. And I see Commissioner May has his hand up.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Thank you. So I noted something strange in the EDR saying that in response to concerns about the design, the Applicant is planning to hire an architectural consultant to help. So who's done the work that we've seen here today? Is that not an architect?'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': ' I'll speak. This is Alan Eidsmore, I'm the Chief of Architecture at the Baltimore Corps of Engineers. And we are doing that in house. We have, as far as the new barracks that are on that side of the street, we have done the first set, and we had another district, Fort Worth, that did the second set. And this is actually the third set of a, what they call the newer barracks, done within the last, say, 10 or 15 years.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' So is it the intent that you're going to hire an architect to consult with your architects and you're going to still do it in house?'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': 'This design actually was kind of an off-take of the previous --previous two. And it was one of the comments that was from when we went through CFA. They wanted us to get an architectural historian that had more, I guess, experience with I guess historic preservation. And I'm not to go into too much depth on that, but we're going to do it just because we were asked to. We have people within the Corps certainly that work with Section 106 interests and preservation projects. So I feel that we can do this in house. But in order to -- it's always nice to have a second set of eyes, let's put it that way, and to bring somebody fresh into the design and take a look and give us some advice on it. Because we are fairly far down the line from some of these more historical buildings.'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': 'And the Army's been good, starting with the first set that was -- there's actually barracks, they stamped those out all over the U.S., and they still have them at the Presidio in San Francisco, for example. And the one thing that the Army has shifted to, though, is going to standard modules and not necessarily the exteriors of the building but the whole building design. So we have a lot of leeway there and we'd certainly like to do whatever we can to bring it in line with the preservation requirements of that area.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Sorry, I missed a little bit of that, but that's okay. I do have a follow up question, which is, you refer to the first version and the second version. When you talk about the first version, are you talking about the version that we saw when we were looking at the master plan for this area?'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': ' I don't know if we can bring up one of the plans or not. I can point it out.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I'm not asking what it looked like, I'm asking, you referred to a first version and a second version. Are those --'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Did we see the first version? Was that presented to this commission?'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': ' Oh, yes. I mean, everything that we have done within the last 10 or 15 years, and that's basically --'",
        "'MS. COX': ' Alan, I believe you were talking about the barracks that were built in 2007 and 2012 timeframe, a little farther north on Sheridan Avenue.'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': ' Yes, yes, and they all went through -- they all went through --all the -- all the review boards that had basically jurisdiction over the reviews. So yeah, CFA,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' You're going way beyond my question. But I have the answers that I need. I will save my comments for when we get to discuss this.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Commissioner Green has his hand raised. And then Commissioner Steingasser, and then I see Commissioner Wright. So, Commissioner Green.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Thank you, and Commissioner May beat me to the punch on my first question. But thank you. And my second question, well, I'd like to ask, I noticed in your presentation which I didn't notice in the previous presentation and that this area is highlighted as in the Army -- Army Directive on Substitute Materials. Could you explain that, please? Anyone?'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': ' I am a little bit lost on that one. The Army directive for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 substitute materials?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Yes, your slide indicated and your coded area's indicating areas of authority. This was within the bounds of -- something was marked as Army directive on substitute materials.'",
        "'MS. COX': ' Jamie, would you mind going to that slide?'",
        "'MS. HERR': ' Yes, let me just pull it up.'",
        "'MR. EIDSMORE': ' Yeah, Paul, if you're -- if you're on, do you have any idea where this came from?'",
        "'MR. WHITE': ' So I think the slide that is being referenced is from the master plan map of the designated areas on campus. It's part of the design guides and installation design guides. We would follow their criteria. Offhand I don't know that criteria, I can't spout it.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' That is the slide.'",
        "'MS. HERR': ' So I just want to clarify that the green area I think that you're referencing, Commissioner Green, is not actually on this part of the map.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' I see a green line heading right at the front elevation of this building. Is that not intended to be a green line? It looks like a green line on my screen. Historic eligible district. (Simultaneous speaking.)'",
        "'MS. COX': ' NRHP-eligible Fort Myer District expansion. That area for expansion into the historic is'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Well, the upper portion of that line looks green on my screen. Okay, that -- my question was perhaps is that the reason why - was that some justification for the design which is very, very thin and looks like it's just an assemblage of pipeline on the building. But that, obviously that wasn't taken into -- that wasn't part of the design. And I guess I'll save my comments for -- but I do hope I misunderstood. And I hope that this -- that the consultant they'll be bringing in will be a little more than perfunctory look. Because I think there's a --there's a good bit of distance for this design to traverse, you know, before it becomes a building worthy of its setting. So I'll hold my comments for the comment period. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Commissioner Steingasser.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' Yes, thank you. I just had some questions about the parking and whether there is any accommodation for electric vehicles.'",
        "'MS. COX': ' There is not. It was not in the military program for this project. But that is something we can look into if it aligns with the funding allocation rules that we have.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' I think that's important with where we're going as --and also is there some reason that there can't -- that you can't use impervious materials for the parking lot?'",
        "'MS. COX': ' We will be exploring that in our stormwater management design. Right now we plan that all of the concrete walkways and some of the paver sections that are dual acting as walkways and fire lanes would be permeable pavers. And then the concrete walkways will be pervious concrete. The asphalt in the POV parking lot, we're limited by the Unified Facilities Criteria for civil engineering doesn't allow porous asphalt. And I'm not exactly sure of the reason for that. But we are limited by that criteria. So we would only be able to look into the pervious -- to look into implementing the pervious concrete or permeable pavers.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' Is there -- so these standards, is there any -- any way to request waivers or updates from that manual?'",
        "'MS. COX': ' Yes, there is a process that each -- each UFC I believe is tri-serviced by the DoD agencies. And there is a process for requesting clarifications and updates. I think it's every few years they review them for updates. But we could certainly look into that.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' I think, yeah, I think that would be nice. Because that parking lot just seems like such a wasted opportunity to do something with pervious pavers or increased landscaping, especially if, as the staff report suggested, the parking is too much and it's an opportunity to bring it down and maybe do some more landscaping there. That's all, thank you.'",
        "'MS. COX': ' Absolutely, thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Steingasser. And I think Commissioner Wright was next, did you have a comment? Or shall we start the round robin?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, I'll hold my fire.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, then I'm going to start I guess -- Commissioner Steingasser, did you have any additional comments you want to make and add to this discussion as a commission about this project?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' Nothing outside of the fact that I think overall this is a really beautiful base and I hope the architecture evolves to reflect that. Thank you, that's all.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Commissioner McMahon? Just a moment, okay, finger up.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Okay, I had to find the, where the mute button was. So thank you. Not a whole lot of comments will go in the discussion. I understand the challenges with continuing to add to the capacity and capability of Fort Myer in this kind of location to provide suitable housing for our junior enlisted, which most of them are. So I support the recommendations in the EDR and I support the work done by the staff. And I'm looking forwards to Fort Myer coming back with a more developed plan and some of the answers to the questions we had.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Very good, thank you, Commissioner McMahon. Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Okay, I really don't like having to do this, but I don't really have any choice because of what we are seeing. If there was ever proof that the Army Corps of Engineers does not have the in-house talent to design a building that we can approve on this campus, it is demonstrated in the other buildings that they have already built. And this, yeah, they've done a little bit more with this one, a little bit more attention to the design. But I don't believe that this is an acceptable design. And hiring an architectural consultant because the CFA asked you to is not only an insufficient strategy, it's an insufficient attitude. And I would argue that this building is not just inadequate for this setting, it is inadequate for any base, that it should not be as, you know, this kit of parts approach and this sort of,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'you know, this really kind of, what's the right word? It's like tract housing development in the suburbs where the developer doesn't even have an architect and they just, you know, look into their kit of parts and say, well, let's do a dormer over here with a pitched roof. And let's do one with a shed roof over there. That's not the way to design this. It is -- it is wholly inadequate, in my view. And I will let others add their thoughts. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Well, I think I will align myself with Commissioner May's comments. I'm kind of -- I'm -- I don't know what the right verb is, but surprised that you know, that anybody who submits projects to NCPC, and including the Army, should understand the issues if they've paid any attention to our work, our concern not only about, you know, about excess parking, which clearly there is here, for this, looking at that parking ratio. And I think that I'll align myself with the comment, with the comments about the compatibility with the Fort Myer Historic District issues. I think -- yeah, that's enough.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, thank you, Commissioner Argo. Commissioner Hewlett.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Well, I was about to start off with well too, just like Commissioner Argo did. I guess I align myself in part with Commissioner McMahon in terms of the staff work and doing the, you know, a good job with what we had. But I would echo many of the comments of Commissioner May as well. And I guess it goes, it's yet again another example of why we cannot be an afterthought. We cannot be tacked on at the very end in a position of trying to play fix-it. We really do have to get a handle on being -- and do some outreach and get a handle on being involved in the forefront of these issues. That's it, thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Hewlett. Commissioner Green.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Thank you. And as I started to mention before, obviously it's a building that struggles with its scale. It's a series of small-scale elements that are stretched and lifted. And it's a little building that got stretched into a large building. And it just needs to be rethought in terms of proportion and massing, and it's the correct architectural expression, but it doesn't know what it wants to be. And it's such a wonderful setting, and I think this building shouldn't benefit from its setting, it should support its setting. It should make its setting better. It shouldn't just piggyback on what surrounds it. And it's a great opportunity here, and the Army has a tradition of, historically designing some wonderful barracks buildings. And so, all of the precedents are right there and this building should make the base better, and it's just not there yet. So, thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much, Commissioner Green. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Well, I applaud the diplomacy of the EDR, because, I mean, I'm almost speechless at how poor this is, and I agree with Mr. May 150 percent. And it's so disappointing to hear matters made worse by the fact that the Army is going to engage -- I heard two things, an architectural historian. With all due respect to Mr. Green, this is not what's needed here. I mean, yes, that's a consultant, yes. But you don't need an architectural consultant. You need a legit card-carrying architect. This building looks like it was designed by an engineer. And I have wonderful engineers who work on our staff. They're just not the people who ought to design a building. And that it's adjacent -- I could go on and on. But the main thing is, as we see often in GSA, if the right people aren't at the table in project'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'formulation, you're just batting cleanup for the rest of the time, and that schedule and budget prevail over quality. And this building that you're proposing is the poster child for that. And it just looks like people want to mail it in and get it done. On a campus like this, that's a shame, and I just don't understand. The Army has an illustrious history of building some pretty lovely buildings. But in the modern era, it's like we're taking our cues from Best Buy, and then we're putting a little pastiche on it, a little shallow detail here or there. It's not just the architectural detail. It's the massing, it's how this building converses with its neighbors. And these are beautiful buildings. Some of the buildings on this base are beautiful. And what you're proposing is an insult to the campus. And I really think you need to start'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'over.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': 'Wow. There's a lot going on here. First, I wanted to thank the staff. And I wish we could put a screen up with a picture, rather than have this nice young lady looking into the camera through this whole discussion. But that's another issue. I do agree with everyone else. I also want to make the point that we're now struggling to get a volunteer army of people coming in who will want to volunteer. And part of that incentive will be kind of, I guess, where they live. And I don't think, as has been said in many different ways, this housing would be an incentive the way it's being put together now, and should be an incentive, in terms of where people will be asked to live when they do volunteer and join. Another thing is, I think that the Corps of Engineers is probably oftentimes heavy'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': 'into the kinds of things that they do, maybe in a military environment, or even a battlefront, if not. And I think that they may need to get more creative talent that I think exists in the Army, brought forward to just look at these kinds of issues, or this kind of construction, to bring a different cut to it, rather than a quick-and-dirty kind of maybe approach that may have happened. I also would like to ask whether there's any -- my usual thing about any solar possibilities here when they do go forward. If there are, then I would appreciate them doing it. And if not, maybe they'll let us know why not solar. If they're going to do electric car charging, I would be curious as to what kind of plugs -- one of my themes -- what kind of plugs are they going to get? Are'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': 'they going to get ones that fit my car, or fit somebody else's car, or somebody else's brand? We need to standardize it sooner or later. And certainly, the military could help start that by encouraging standardization of the plugs that you put into cars so it works for everybody, not just for one. Like our gas nozzles and our gasoline stations fit all cars with different octanes. Also, I would like to encourage that we watch out. I've been listening to a lot of the presentations, the ones that I could get today. We're getting grifted into using acronyms a lot. And for the public, it's kind of hard. I don't think we did in this case, but I just want to mention, generally speaking, we've got to explain what these alphabets stand for, to some people who may not know, as others do. Thank you, Madam Chair, and'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': 'I'm looking forward to how this develops. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. And then finally, Commissioner Davis, and then I'll make some remarks. Commissioner Davis?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' No thoughts for me. Thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'Okay. I don't think I missed anyone this time. I just want to say, I concur that I think the quality of the architectural design is going to need to be improved, and I just want to mention I'm very proud to have a nephew who's an Army ranger. I work with the Army Corps of Engineers at Rock Island in the Mississippi River Division on a daily basis in my day job, and have tremendous respect for the Corps and for the talent there. I'd like to say that I'm not sure what your resources are, and what you've been given to work with. But I think you're hearing us just -- and we want to honor you and the people who are members of the Army. And their barracks need to reflect the kind of respect and honor and beauty that we think you all deserve. So, I'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'don't want this to be too harsh, but I think you've heard it already. Realistically, we need some improvements in the design here, so that it reflects the important work and service you provide to our country, and that we can all be proud of. So, again, I don't know how much you've been given, in terms of resources, but this is not an insurmountable request, I think, from the Commission, to improve the design to address some of the permeability of the parking structure and some of the green space. It's a great heritage you're a part of, and we just want you to know we honor you and your work, and we're going to be looking forward to the next iteration. So, as the design develops, know that we're here as resources, not just here to criticize. And I think that's an important concept to understand. And with'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'that, is there a motion to receive and approve the comments on the concept plans for the Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Barracks?'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': ' So moved.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Commissioner Dixon has made a motion to receive and approve these comments. Is there a second?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' I second.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Commissioner McMahon has seconded the motion.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Can I ask a question? We're often in this position where we're voting on the EDR, and the EDR's language does articulate much of the criticism that we have leveled against the architecture. But does it insist? That's a question.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' There's been a motion and there's been a second, so we can take questions and further discussion. Is there staff that would like to respond to that? Or are you asking for Commissioners to respond to your question? Or is it a rhetorical question?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' No, it's a specific question about -- because I don't have two screens, so I don't have the EDR in front of me to look at the specific language, but I did think that it was very diplomatic. But does it insist that the design be improved? (Simultaneous speaking.)'",
        "'MS. HERR': ' Oh, sorry. I just wanted to speak up. I think, like with the last project, how Commissioner Hewlett added emphasis to specific areas that were already covered in the EDR, that may be an option in this case, if you would like to consider that.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes, Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'I mean, the specific language in the EDR, with regard to the architecture, is a finding that the proposed architecture, while improved from the master plan review, lacks fenestration and materiality that is complementary to the Fort Myer National Historic District. And then it recommends that the applicant can update the architecture with more details that are compatible with the design vocabulary of the Fort Myer National Historic District. And I think we heard some comments from the Commission that go well beyond that. And I think it would be appropriate to come up with an additional recommendation that goes beyond simply updating the architecture with more details. I think that Commissioner Green did a very good job of encapsulating, or summarizing, what the key issue is. Right? It's a building that's struggling with its scale. And so, I think that something like that would be appropriate. It's hard enough'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'to draft additional recommendations when we're all in the same room. And I'm not sure how we do it in this circumstance, but maybe we want to break for a few minutes while the staff comes up with something stronger that captures that, or maybe another Commissioner wants to write something. I have not tried to write something now, as I have done in the past, but I think that modifying the EDR would be a helpful step.'",

There were comments about the appropriateness of this design for its setting, and how it is totally lacking in that regard, and that they need to go beyond hiring -- well, I don't want to tell them how they do it. They can figure out how to do it. But they really do need to hire a real architect with experience building new buildings in an historic context, which --(Simultaneous speaking.)'",

We may not be able to take that to the bank, but I'd like to think we will and they will get the message. And I hope that the language in here gives enough interpretation to make it clear that we want more done than has been done. I also believe that within the ranks of the military, there are talented architects to do this work.

But I keep hearing the words mass and scale. And I'll have to go back and take a look while, I guess, Ms. Sullivan is drafting some new language for us at the CFA report-out, which, likewise, had some good comments concerning that design and what they were trying to accomplish. And I think that's what we're really trying to focus on is those architectural details. I'm not sure, depending on what we meant by mass and scale, that there's much to be done there, looking at the scope of what the Army's trying to work with on that site. And those units are trying to build 140 units or so for those units that we talked about. But certainly, how do we adjust'",

And it's not just about having pitched roofs and dormers. It's not about fenestration. It is about understanding the building type that you're dealing with at that larger scale. And then once you have that building type understood, making that building, that larger building, compatible with the existing context. Right? I don't know if that is helpful or not.

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes, we can.'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'Good afternoon, Chair Goodmann and Commission members. For the monumental cost reshape project, I'm presenting the draft guidelines for small-scale elements. Today, we request your authorization to release the draft guidelines for public comments. I'll start off with a brief recap of the project, including the urban design framework, then present the draft guideline for small-scale elements that we organized into two groups. Attached to your meeting packet are the principal summary and the draft guideline document. I'll wrap up the presentation with next steps. For the benefit of the audience who did not watch the presentation last month on vertical and surface elements, I will start with a quick recap of the purpose and background of the streetscape manual. The manual was first created in 1992, and consists of construction detail and specification. There was a minor amendment in 2013. The agencies viewed this technical document to achieve a'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'coordinated and consistent streetscape for broadening the central area of the city, and in the vicinity of the National Mall. In fact, the manual was used on 25 capital improvement projects between 1992 and 2012. Today, the manual is 30 years old. A comprehensive update is needed to reflect current best-practices in urban design, city planning, and landscape architecture. In 2018, we began the guideline update to achieve high-quality streetscape, and to improve the connections and relationship between the Monumental Core and the surrounding neighborhood, as shown on the slide. The new manual will be used by agencies to plan, develop, and coordinate, streetscape projects. NCPC and CFS staff used the manual during project review. NCPC is leading this update in collaboration with the interagency working group, comprising eleven federal and local agencies listed here on the left. We also received extensive input from agency experts, including bicycle specialists, preservationists,'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'and landscape architect. We developed the guideline for small-scale elements. In particular, we engaged subject matter experts at D.C. Water, D.C. Public Works, fire department, and PEPCO. We appreciate their time and participation in the working group meetings. As a reminder, the project has four phases. Phase one included the open design framework and lighting policy, which the Commission saw in 2018 and 2019. The Commission directed staff to use the framework as the foundation to develop the streetscape design guidelines and construction manual. We are here today to talk about phase 2, the streetscape design guidelines. You may recall that the guidelines are being developed into parts. The Commission accepted the final guidelines for vertical and surface elements at the March meeting. Today, we are asking the Commission to release the draft guidelines for small-scale elements for a 60-day public comment period. And this fall, we will come back'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'to request acceptance of the final guidelines that address public comments. Before getting into the guidelines, it's important to recap the urban design framework, which provides an organizing principle for the guidelines development, to achieve a coordinated and consistent streetscape throughout the Monumental Core, and also recognize the neighborhood identities. The framework includes three distinct street categories that help inform the degree of consistency in the streetscape. We have the radiating and edging streets, shown in hot pink, which have national importance and symbolic meaning. The connecting and traversing streets, in pale pink, have national and local importance, and local streets, in white, make up the city grid, and serve as a functional network for the District. The framework also identifies eleven character areas, as represented by different colors on this map. The character areas are important because they help shape neighborhood identity. They are defined by their unique and'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'used open design, architectural and landscape character, within this precinct or neighborhood. They do not represent formal jurisdictional boundaries. The streetscape comprises a range of elements. We organize them into three groups: vertical, surface, and small-scale. While the vertical and surface elements contribute to the identity of Monumental Core, it's the small-scale elements that contribute to the neighborhood identity. The ten small-scale elements are the focus of today's presentation. Before we get into the details, it's important to remind everyone that the guidelines only apply to public space from the property line to the curb, and only when there's a major site redevelopment or capital improvement project. They are not applicable to routine maintenance or repair. We organized ten elements into two groups: furnishings, and civic infrastructure. Now, I will get into the guidelines, starting with the first group. Furnishings provides functional amenities for pedestrians, and contributes to walk vitality'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'of public space. They may adapt to character areas, while highlighting unique qualities of a neighborhood, and support streetscape consistency. In general, the guidelines ensure that the designs are compatible, and complementary with other streetscape elements. Benches are important, because they improve pedestrian experience and comfort. We can find existing variety of bench style material and conditions within the Monumental Core. Around National Mall and places with national significance, like the White House and Pennsylvania Avenue, benches have similar looks in wood and metal. And in the surrounding neighborhood, the types and style vary, to reflect unique neighborhood character. This map shows the dominant bench style of NPS benches around the National Mall, noted in purple, and Victor Stanley bench at Presidents Park and Capitol grounds in yellow The proposed guidance helps define different character areas, and distinguish Monumental Core from the surrounding urban fabric. The guidelines also encourage collaboration'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'with the working group with agencies introduce a new bench design. We organized the guidelines into three topics: placement, appearance, and function. In summary, the bench guidelines support providing benches to improve pedestrian comfort and convenience for people of all ages and abilities. The next element is receptacles. Receptacles for trash, recycling, and other waste types, are important because they contribute to the aesthetic, functional, and environmental qualities of the streetscape. There are many receptacle styles around the Monumental Core, from historic style, like the original PADC, to the standout Victor Stanley receptacle that NPS uses through branded receptacles from business improvement districts and universities. This map shows the location of trash and recycling containers, as noted in the legend with circle and square. Victor Stanley, shown in blue, is the dominant style and modified PADC style, in magenta, are concentrated along Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive. The proposed guidance'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'identifies where receptacles should typically be located, including near the crosswalks, street corners, and in areas with high pedestrian traffic. The guidelines also encourage co- locating recycling, trash and other waste container to support appropriate waste management. In summary, the guidelines support providing conveniently located receptacles that minimize clutter, and improve the pedestrian experience. It's important to mention here that the District is working to implement Mayor Bowser's Zero-Waste D.C. Plan, and is conducting a study on recycling containers in public space. We are coordinating with DPW on this report, and have developed criteria for new receptacle design. Now, we are moving to the second group of small-scale elements. Civic infrastructure provides service to pedestrian cyclists and emergency services, who form part of the connected utility system. There are eight in this group, and I will provide a quick summary for each element. In general, the guidelines encourage designs that'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'are compatible and complementary with other streetscape elements. Let's begin with bicycle rack. Bike racks are important because they support multi-modal transportation, provide parking for micro-mobility VA codes, and reduce streetscape clutter. We can find several types of bike racks around Monumental Core, and this map shows where they are distributed. The U-racks, shown in orange, are scattered throughout, where the post-and-hitch racks, in neon-green, are concentrated around Smithsonian properties. Regarding guideline development, the working group identified areas where there is high demand for additional bike parking, as noted in purple dots. The proposed guidelines recommend U- racks within the Monumental Core, because they are more versatile and secure. As we replace and install new bike racks over time, we will achieve a unified style throughout the Monumental Core. I mentioned earlier, we use that publication to inform the guidelines. In summary, this support provides durable and user-friendly bike racks'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'to promote multi-modal transportation, and provide parking in designated areas. Next element is post and chain. They are important for guiding pedestrian movement and protecting trees and vegetation from foot traffic. Currently, there is different applications for post and chain. They are used to protect landscape areas, and in some cases, to manage curbside activities, as shown in the bottom-left image. The guidelines encourage placing post and chain at the backside edge of pedestrian walkway and sidewalk, to avoid hassle to pedestrians. This map shows the general location of post and chain around Monumental Core. In summary, the guidelines support using post and chain to guide pedestrian circulation and protect sensitive environments. Next element is Electric Vertical Charging Station. Electric vehicle, or EV, helps advance sustainability goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In general there are three types of EV chargers. Level one chargers take overnight for the battery to'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'be fully charged. Level two takes a few hours, and level three is fast-charging that takes about 20 to 30 minutes. For the guidelines, they are applicable to curbside level-2 chargers only. An emerging technology, best- practice, for curbside EV chargers are still being developed, tested, and refined, in many communities. To develop the guidelines, we engaged DDOT EVT, and referenced DDOT permit application process for EV curbside charting program, as well as using resources from other jurisdictions. At this time, there are two EV chargers in the Monumental Core. However, we anticipate EV chargers will become more common and prominent in the streetscape, as infrastructure expands nationwide in response to rapid adoption by consumers through technology and robust federal policy and investment. In summary, the guidelines support promoting EV in a manner that is well-coordinated with curbside usage, and minimizes potential disruption in public space. The guidelines also encourages'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'close collaboration among agencies, to potentially incorporate EV charger with other streetscape elements, such as telecommunication poles. Next element is parking pay station. The multi-space parking pay stations are important because they provide a convenient payment option, and reduce the number of digital parking meters. Parking stations are conveniently located around Monumental Core, particularly on Jefferson and Madison Drive, and Constitution Avenue. In summary, the guidelines support providing parking pay stations for people of all abilities, to increase convenience for drivers, and improve the pedestrian experience. The next element is water station. They are important because drinking water improves pedestrian comfort, enjoyment, and safety, in public space. Water stations includes both water fountains and filling stations for water bottles. Several styles of water stations exist in the Monumental Core. The new NPS style on the bottom-left features a filling station for water bottles, this also interesting, historic style, on the'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'Capitol campus, as shown on the right. This map shows the current location of water stations. They are concentrated on the west side of 14th Street and Tidal Basin. In summary, the guidelines support increasing availability of water stations that are universally accessible and working properly. The next element is fire hydrants. They are important for our access to water supply and public safety. This map shows the location of fire hydrants and their colors. We learned from the conversation with the fire department that the standout color for fire hydrants in public space is green, and black fire hydrants are decommissioned. We also learned that they have reflective color bands attached to the body, to indicate water pressure for firefighters. In summary, the guidelines support providing fire hydrants that meet color safety codes, in maintaining safe and efficient operation. The penultimate element is utility boxes. They are important for'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'supporting critical networks of civic infrastructure. There are several types of utility boxes that have similar requirements. We organized them into two groups. Traffic and communication boxes facilitate traffic movement and communication operations, including wifi and cable. They need to be located near street intersections for technical and safety reasons. Electric and water utility boxes facilitate basic energy and water operation. They are usually located closer to the buildings for meter-reading purposes. Utility boxes are scattered throughout the Monumental Core. They come in different sizes, ranging from one-foot tall to six feet. Some have a battery attached, as shown in the photo. We learned from traffic engineers that DDOT is in the process of co-locating smaller units into larger, six-feet-tall, utility boxes. The functional requirements of utility boxes inference their location and color. This metric summarizes the guidelines. In sun-exposed and paved areas, all utility boxes must be gray, to'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'minimize heatgain. However, in landscape areas, utility boxes can be green, to blend in with the landscape, except for traffic and communication boxes, because they are sensitive to heat. In summary, the guidelines support accommodating boxes in public space that minimize clutter, blend with the surroundings, and maintain efficient operation. Last, but not least, small-scale elements. Wireless communication technology is important for providing daily and emergency event communication to residents, workers, visitors, emergency responders, and security providers. With the increased demand on our communication systems, there is an emerging need for small-scale infrastructure. Cellular providers propose to increase the capacity of their networks by deploying rooftop antennas, mobile infrastructure, and standalone poles. In 2018 and 2019, NCPC and DDOT began to collaborate on how to address the impacts of standalone poles. DDOT adopted the manual in 2019 that provides guidance on the placement and design of small-scale infrastructure, within the'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'District public right-of-way. This map, in the District's small- scale guidelines, shows potential location for permanent standalone poles within the Monumental Core, outside of National Mall.

The Urban Design and Plan Review Division is leading this work and anticipates looking at a potential locations with the Commission this fall, which will continue into 2024. When this work is complete, the location and design will be cross-referenced in the streetscape manual. This completes the summary of the draft guidelines for small-scale elements. Now, we're going to look ahead to the next phase of work for the streetscape manual project. We're going to present the draft guidelines to CFA on April 20th. During public comment period, we will host two public meetings in May. Once we address public comments, we'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': 'will be back to request Commission acceptance, and bundle the vertical cell phase and small-scale guidelines into one comprehensive package. This will wrap up phase two of the project. In the meantime, we are also working on phase three, to update the construction detail and specifications, design examples of typical technical drawings in the construction manual. The manual will specify detailed materials, finishes, and color, for the streetscape elements. In conclusion, the executive director recommends the Commission to authorize the release of the draft guidelines for the small-scale elements, for a 60-day public comment period, find that the guidelines are consistent with the comp plan, and urban design and work, commend the entire Agency working group, and direct staff to use the guidelines to inform construction manual updates. This concludes my presentation, and I will stay on for questions.'",

        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': 'First, I think it's a very fine effort made. Obviously, a lot of detail and data gathering, which is unbelievable. It mapped it, and all that was very well done. I have a couple of items I'd just like to just raise, and maybe they'll be brought by the public when they comment. I think it'd be great to send it out for comment and get more thoughtful comment from the public, of course. I know that the trash containers, we're not dealing with the concern for bombs. There was a bomb concern at one point about trash containers. In a lot of jurisdictions, they had certain conditions on them so you couldn't --to helpfully mitigate that. I just phrase that as a concern. The second issue has to do with your electric chargers. One of my old themes about making sure that the plugs, the connectors, have some universal'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': 'application, because we don't want to just build them to help and support one particular car vendor because their plugs fit only one car vendor. We need to make sure we get some encouragement to standardize at both ends, the manufacturing of them in the cars, and the use of them on our streets. And also, part of this, in having an electric car myself, slightly, people use these as excuses for parking in spaces. So, I don't know how we deal with that to encourage people to get charged and move on, or maybe they just pay for parking like they would someplace else and they get the benefit of the charge. I don't know how you manage that one. But just to raise that as a concern. And the last one -- well, that pretty much covers the issues I'm concerned about. And again, thank you for your'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'Yeah, thanks. Obviously a lot of detail, a lot of work to gather the information you gathered, in terms of current location. You take pictures of current applications. Just a couple of comments as we go through -- and I will support the motion when we get to that point. Mr. Dixon is exactly right, there are -- and I don't know if it's part of this small scale or not for consideration of public spaces. I suspect Commissioner May will have some comments, and maybe Commissioner Wright will get there. But they do make bomb-proof trash containers. I'm aware of that from my work with the Department of Census and public areas, that allow us to do that, but then also provide some protection to the public if someone tries to use one of those containers to place some kind of explosive device in it. Regarding that charging, Mr.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'Dixon got it exactly right. I'll relate a quick story about electric vehicles, because I drive a 2016 Chevrolet Volt. And when I went to see my chiropractor the other day and thought, oh, look, there's a DV ghost station, let me just try it out. And as the technology continues to change, it's not just a Tesla versus the world issue. The only charging stations they had were the new high-rate charging stations. I'm always saying I can do level one and level two in my little Volt, and they didn't have that capability there. So, that's going to be a continuing issue. Not to mention, going back to the issue of, how long can you park that car there. You can't park your car there, go see a few museums and spend the day, unless someone else wants to use it as we try and build gas stations'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': 'in the Mall. You're kind of talking about it like this. So, that's going to be less of an issue of what the standard looks like or where they're done. And lastly, I think Commissioner May, who it's great to see that NPS is doing wireless charging stations, I think which would probably actually help us install a retractable cable in it. And that conversation is certainly worth a discussion. As we do these standards, I think we need to think about retractable cables in the public, no matter where we do charging stations. So, those are my comments.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Very good. Thank you, Commissioner McMahon. Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I must be getting really tired, because I'm kind of spent. I don't have a whole lot to say at this point. I will just say that I don't have any conversation about trash containers. I'll leave them out. But we've had a lot of conversation in turning to the Park Service about EV charging. And hopefully, that will make progress in the near future. And I would also just want to encourage folks to drive or ride self-charging vehicles, which were also addressed here, but we don't quite grasp some things like that.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much, Commissioner May. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' I don't have --I'm sorry, I can't get my thing on here. I don't have any additional comments. Somebody said something about -- and I guess they're not included -- security issues can't resolve that? Are not included in the small-scale element guidelines?'",
        "'MR. JAMAWAT': ' Security cameras are not included in these guidelines.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Okay. All right, thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, thank you, Commissioner Argo. Commissioner Hewlett?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' I would just associate my comments with those of Vice-Chair Dixon. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Commissioner Green?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Thank you, and I appreciate the fine grain of this. That it's just so much of the pedestrian, the visitor experience, as those things that you see and touch and walk on, you sit on. And it's easy to overlook those things. And I appreciate the thoroughness behind this, because that's so much of what pedestrians and visitors experience when they come to D.C. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Green. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' To what I'm sure will be everyone's great relief, I have no comment.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Oh, goodness. Commissioner Wright, thank you very much. Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': ' No further comments.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Cash is not here. Commissioner Davis?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' No comments from me at all. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much, Commissioner Davis. My comments are that I'm looking forward to the input from stakeholders and the public that will be coming forward and we will be reviewing in the future. So, I'm grateful for that. And I wasn't trying to end the meeting early. I want to thank everyone who reminded me that I missed agenda item 6(e) and just jumped a page. And I do apologize for that. And Jeff, it was a wonderful presentation. Very thorough, and certainly very informative. We know where we are going now with the public engagement and we'll look forward to hearing more. So, we have a motion and we have a second on this. So, can we have the roll out taken here on the vote?'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' So, the motion was made by Commissioner Dixon and seconded by Commissioner Hewlett. So, Commissioner Steingasser?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Commissioner May?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Commissioner Hewlett?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Chair Goodman?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Commissioner Green?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'VICE CHAIR DIXON': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' And Commissioner Davis?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' Yes. passes.'",
        "'MR. STAUDIGL': ' That's everyone.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' The motion clearly Thank you very much, Mr. Staudigl. We're grateful for your work in Julia's absence. Thank you a lot for all your help. And this concludes our open session agenda for real. Yes, I have a question from Commissioner Hewlett.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' It's not a question. But Madam Chair, on behalf of all of us, we extend our deepest condolences to you from us.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. It means a lot. And, like every family that goes through this, you lose a mom or dad, and that's always sort of a landmark. As my good Irish relatives say, now you're the tall trees in the forest. So, I'm practicing being a tall tree now. And I do appreciate your expression of sympathy. Thank you. So, this does conclude our open session agenda, and our next regular Commission meeting will be on Thursday, May 4, 2023, at 1:00 p.m. And I am going to be at the offices in Washington for that meeting. And if there's no further business, then this session is now adjourned. And thank you all.'"
