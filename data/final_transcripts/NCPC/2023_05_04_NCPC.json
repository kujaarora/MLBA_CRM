We discussed some of the details and the ongoing planning. And it continues to be a tremendously exciting project even for a person like me, a newcomer to the NCPC.

I'm taking time each month to come meet with other commissions and partners that we have in the District and adjoining counties. So that was a very good meeting and I'm grateful to staff for helping to set those up. And then most importantly, this is Commissioner's May's last meeting.

We started out at the Building Museum and true to form, we started out bickering because he was the business manager and I was curator and I wanted things that were essential to get ironically from GSA. And here we are now 35 years later. And we started out bickering and disagreeing and we sort of ended up bickering on the Commission a little bit. And most of the time -- most of the time, we agreed.

Government, interesting times to which I will not delve further. But in my comparatively short time as a member of NCPC, I have seen what I saw then, Peter's well-honed eyed for good design and his quick discerning ability to parse out laws and reinforce solid aspects of projects. Only now, more sharp, honed, and strategic. His contributions to the work of the Commission cannot be overstated.

Government Zoning Commission as a representative for the Architect of the Capitol and I had just started in D.C. Government in the Office of Planning. And Peter was always very generous and very diplomatic in the way he shared information and was very helpful at least to me who did not have a strong design background in kind of pulling us forward and helping us understand the way to things -- think about things. And I think I have worked with Peter in one form or another, except for year 2006 to 2007 when you took a break, but you went from being on the Zoning Commission to being a D.C.

Because in addition to being a commissioner, you know, we bring projects to the Commission. And it's important to have that support and understanding from the staff, as well as, you know, their critical eye on what we are doing. So I am really grateful for all of that. I have to say this has been some of the most rewarding and important work of my career. And I just am really grateful for having had the opportunity to serve.

Maybe not everyone will make it all the way through the Commission, but it's a lot going on. And there are major Park Service projects coming as well. And I'm sorry I won't be here to advocate for them. But I will be replaced and I'm sure my successor will do an excellent job representing the Park Service on those.

And you know, we do it all and I think with the right kind of perspective. We're all aiming ultimately for the same purpose and it's really just a matter of how we get there. I wanted to offer some words of encouragement to my fellow commissioners. I really want you to be thinking big. Right?

I know everybody likes to, you know, an easy, noncontroversial meeting. That can be a relief, but it's the controversial ones and the contentious ones, I think where the most important work can happen. I think we have to remember that the mission is the public realm. Remember, this used to be the National Capital Park and Planning Commission and the emphasis on the public and their appreciation of what we do and how our environment is experienced in this area. I mean that is just the critical thing. So don't be timid. Question the applicants. Question the staff. Question each other. Don't just do checkbox planning. That's a temptation all the time.

But it's been a great experience working with you. You've always generously shared your time and expertise with our staff. And while you've contributed much to the Commission around our monthly project review, I would like to actually commend you on your strong support for our long-term planning efforts, especially the Pennsylvania Avenue Initiative. I think we don't focus a lot on our long-term planning at the Commission on a month to month basis, but you've always been there for us and you've always been a great advocate for in terms of the city and'",

You've done stellar work for this Commission and your legacy will live on, as I'm sure, will the quality of the comments and reviews that we provide on applications. So thank you very much. Madam Chair, today I'd like to report on House of Representatives Bill 2717. This is entitled the Hershel Woody Williams National Medal of Honor Monument Location Act. It was introduced on April 19th of this year and referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources. The bill is dedicated to Hershel Woody Williams, the last World War II recipient of the Medal of Honor who died in 2022, and amends'",

This public law authorized the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation to establish a commemorative work on federal land in the District of Columbia for its environments consistent with the requirements of the Commemorative Works Act to honor the extraordinary acts of valor, selfless service, and sacrifice displayed by medal of honor recipients. The amendment proposed by H.R. 2717 authorizes a commemorative work to Medal of Honor recipients to be located within the Reserve, attached to, or not more than 1,000 feet from the Lincoln Memorial. This requirement stems from the fact that President Abraham Lincoln was the founder and awarded the first Medal of Honors in our country's history. That concludes my report. This memorial will be coming to the Commission, but it remains to be seen whether this bill and its location requirement will pass. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.'",

Good afternoon, Chair Goodmann and members of the Commission. The United States Department of Agriculture has submitted preliminary plans to construct a new main visitor gate for the National Arboretum on Bladensburg Road. The project would also construct a new access road and repave part of an interior Arboretum roadway known as Azalea Road. As part of the repaving project, a portion of Azalea Road would be widened by 4 feet to accommodate future two-way traffic between the new Bladensburg Gate and the Arboretum's developed interior core area. And before I continue with my presentation, I would like to point out that we recently amended the EDR to note the project's inclusion of security bollards. And we also added a request to review the Arboretum's security analysis'",

And this information should be part of the next Bladensburg Gate Project submission. As such, here are our comment categories that relate to the need for the transportation study, as well as the proposed design of the new gate, site design, and finally we request some specific information as part of the next project submission from the applicant. And I will go through each of these topic areas as part'",

The irregularly shaped property is situated between New York Avenue to the north with adjacent sections of Bladensburg Road and R Street to the west and M Street to the south. The current main public gate to the Arboretum is located at the end of R Street, which is a residential street. And here you can see a variety of adjacent, nearby land uses with Anacostia Park to the south and east, residential neighborhoods to the south, southwest, and west, and various commercial areas shown here in yellow located to the northwest and the north.

Early American leaders envisioned a national garden where science could be applied to the country's agricultural resources to advance national economic prosperity. In response, Congress passed the National Arboretum Act on March 4th, 1927 to establish the Arboretum for the purposes of research and education concerning tree and plant life. Currently more than 600,000 people visit the Arboretum annually to appreciate its balance of cultivated gardens and natural landscapes, to enjoy the grounds as a recreational amenity, and to learn about horticulture. As part of the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, the Arboretum employs scientists who maintain a large and invaluable inventory of plants to support research for the nation and around the world. The latest comprehensive Arboretum master plan is from 2000. And more recently, the USDA took an initial step towards updating this plan with a concept level master plan submission to NCPC'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'in 2021 for review and comment. The Arboretum's concept core framework plan was based on a number of future planning goals, including reinforcing the Arboretum's campus core through future development and improving interior circulation, and perimeter accessibility, and augmenting the Arboretum's ecological character, scientific mission, and historic assets. And the Commission commented favorably on the core plan's overall approach, its vision, goals, and objectives and the Arboretum's proposal to construct a new main visitor gate along Bladensburg Road, which is the subject of our review here today. As part of our master plan review action, the Commission requested additional traffic and parking information as part of a future draft Arboretum master plan submission. And this would help us better understand the impacts of the new Bladensburg Road Gate and other proposed changes as reflected in the concept core framework master plan. More recently in January of 2022, our Commission approved'",

And as part of that project submission, the Arboretum described a number of proposed changes to its existing system of gates. Here is a graphic from our previous review, which shows a total of eight existing gates today, some of which are non-operational. Several gates currently allow pedestrian and service vehicle access only. And there are two gates that allow public vehicular access into the Arboretum. One visitor gate is located along New York Avenue and the other gate is situated at the end of R Street, Northeast. And that project submission did reflect the Arboretum's current proposal to relocate its main visitor gate from R Street to Bladensburg Road, along with the closing of New York Avenue -- the New York Avenue Gate to visitors. So in the future, all visiting motorized traffic would use the new Bladensburg Gate to'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'access the Arboretum. As part of our Commission action, we noted the Arboretum would not implement any operational changes to its gate until its master plan update was approved by NCPC. And we reminded the Arboretum to coordinate all plans circulation and accessibility-related changes with DDOT, the District Office of Planning, and other stakeholders. And we also noted the Arboretum will need to work with NCPC and DDOT to assess its future transportation and parking impacts. And so we again reiterate these points in today's Executive Director's Recommendation, which is before us here today for adoption. First, requiring the Arboretum to complete a comprehensive analysis that examines specific issues that include assessing the Bladensburg Gate's use as the only future public vehicular gate, changing part of the Arboretum's internal roadway network to two-way traffic, and assessing the need for a new traffic signal at the future Bladensburg Gate intersection. And'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'we also note that Applicant will work with DDOT to undertake the study. And we include a requirement for the Arboretum to submit its transportation analysis to NCPC as part of the next project submission and along with a modified 2020 core framework plan so that we can understand the transportation implications from all of the Arboretum's future projects. So with that plan in context, I will now walk you through the project submission itself. The purpose of the new gate is to improve public accessibility, to increase the Arboretum's visibility, and to reduce visitor traffic along R Street, Northeast. Here is the project location in the western part of the Arboretum with the new Bladensburg Gate, a new 1200 foot long access road, and the repaving of a 3700 foot long section of Azalea Road, 2500 feet of which or approximately 70 percent would be widened by 4 feet'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'to accommodate future two-way traffic between the new gate and the Arboretum's developed core area. And this is reflected again in the 2020 concept framework plan. Here's a closer view of the existing new gate location, currently improved with a medium break, a 72 foot wide curb cut and driveway apron. And these were previously installed by DDOT in 2005 to help prepare the site for the Arboretum's future visitor entrance here. Here's a site plan that shows the new gate with a retaining wall on its north side and a perimeter fence connection to its south side. The gate itself would include a pair of double swing arms. And the two interior arms would connect to a short section of black decorative fencing, which would be installed directly into the pavement. Here's a close-up of the preliminary project rendering that shows the new gate's different components. And the Arboretum'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'intends the current gate design to be an interim solution until the new entrance becomes operational and then the applicant will seek additional funding to further refine the gate design in the future. The gate's north retaining wall would be constructed in reinforced concrete with a real stone facade to help give the structure a more rustic and natural look. And the stone would reflect other existing Arboretum gates as shown in these photos on the left-hand side of the slide. However, in light of the gate's function as the Arboretum's new main public entrance and with future funding uncertainty, the Arboretum should continue to refine its gate design now with possible changes that may include a new wall on the gate's south side to give the entrance a more symmetrical look, installing new decorative pavement, adding a raised landscape median, and installing appropriate entry signage. And we include these'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'suggestions in our final Executive Director's Recommendation today that's before you. In addition, these are the two late comments that we added to the revised EDR. We note the current plans show security bollards on one side of the driveway in front of the retaining wall. And we added a request for the Arboretum to submit a security threat assessment that justifies the needs to install bollards there. And these comments are again included in the Executive Director's Recommendation. Moving to the Arboretum, the national topography of the project site is sloping, rising by approximately 30 feet between Bladensburg Road and Azalea Road to the east. The site would require regrading to accommodate the new access road. The new 1200 foot long road would average just over 2 percent grade, which complies with ADA standards with a 24 foot width to accommodate future two-way traffic and a 6 foot wide'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'sidewalk along its west side. The new sidewalk would terminate at a newly created intersection between the access road and Azalea Road, so the intention would be for visiting pedestrians to travel up the hill using the sidewalk until reaching Azalea Road. And then pedestrians would share Azalea Road with vehicles and bicyclists, which is how the Arboretum's interior roadways currently function today. Staff supports the Arboretum's intent to preserve the natural sloping topography here by minimalizing the project's use of retaining walls. And we included this as a comment in the final Executive Director's Recommendation. As previously mentioned, the Arboretum would repave Azalea Road between Boxwood Loop in the north and Eagle's Nest Road to the east. And these photos help illustrate the need for the proposed repaving. Currently this section of Azalea Road operates in a one-way counter clockwise direction as shown here on the slide. The project'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'would repave and maintain the road's existing 20 foot width for continued one-way operation between Boxwood Loop and the new access road. And then a 250 foot long section would be repaved and widened by 4 feet, resulting in a total new roadway width of 24 feet. And the widened roadway would allow future two-way traffic between the new Bladensburg Road Gate and the Arboretum's developed core area, which again is reflected in the 2020 concept framework plan. And we note this as part of the Executive Director's Recommendation. However, as previously mentioned, without an analysis of this and other changes, staff is unable to recommend support for the proposed partial two-way conversion at this time. And this is why we have included a number of comments to spell out our need for a future traffic analysis as I previously summarized in the beginning of my presentation. And one last'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'aspect of the project I would like to note here is that the Arboretum would also repave an existing nine-space visitor lot that is located directly adjacent to Azalea Road, which is shown here in this photo. And as the lot is located relatively close to the future access road and its sidewalk, an existing trail connection, which is seen here in this photo, we did include a recommendation to extend the sidewalk along the widened section of Azalea Road to meet the existing trail in the final Executive Director's Recommendation. And finally, I just wanted to mention that although the Arboretum had originally planned to remove an existing historic overlook area as part of this project, based on the project's ongoing Section 106 consultation process, the applicant has elected to preserve the overlook. And we note our support for their decision to preserve this feature in our final Executive'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'Director's Recommendation. And before I conclude, there are several items that staff would like the applicant to include in its next project submission to the Commission, including lighting plans, a landscape plan, more detailed retaining wall and gate plans, the security threat analysis, and updated photo simulations. And we also inserted recommendations to comply with International Dark-Sky Association standards and to incorporate milkweed and other pollinated plants into the project's future landscaping. So that concludes my presentation. And as I've already gone through each of my comments during the presentation, I will not re-review those again at this time. However, I would like to introduce Dr. Richard Olsen who is the Director of the National Arboretum. And he would like to make a statement on behalf of the project. And then once he is finished, he and one of his consultants, Mr. Stephen Kraus will both be available to respond'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'to any questions that the Commission may have. Thank you.'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'Well thank you, Michael and thank you, Commission for this review of the preliminary concept plan for the Bladensburg Road Gate and Azalea Road stabilization project. Not much to add there, Michael. That was exceptionally comprehensive. So I just want to reiterate how important this project is for us. As Michael mentioned, it's been part of not only the 2000 master plan, but the 2007 updated master plan. The work was done in 2005 to put in the intersection. And this issue of a main entrance for vehicles has been outstanding at the National Arboretum since the 1970s. So, the prior master plans have all agreed and in collaboration with DDOT that this is the location of the entrance. That work was done so the initial intent of this was that we would be connecting to the already approved existing intersection and curb cut. It's important to note that we'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'have collaborated with DDOT, hosting their Bladensburg Road safety studies, contributing comments, even hosting their meeting here at the National Arboretum to represent the entrance and understand what improvements are being done in Bladensburg. Just like we did in 1999 that led to this entrance in coordination with DDOT. As Michael mentioned, this is the 2020 concept plan, the core framework. We revisited the approved design from NCPC. That design was unfortunately prohibitively expensive. And the realities of funding and funding streams within the Arboretum and the USDA makes us approach these projects -- my apologies -- with a sense of what's financially possible. So that limits their scopes and the doable and projects that we can break up into, things that might actually get the attention of the Administration and Congress. All of our funds for this type of project must come through the USDA and then ultimately Congress.'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'It's also important to note that in the concept as Michael pointed out, that R Street would be renovated in the future to include reopen as a pedestrian and bicycle gate. There's a pedestrian door there that's been closed for many decades. So that would be available to accommodate the incoming proposed bike traffic, as well as the M Street Gate, which prior to 2020 concept, 2021 framework plan, recall that the M Street Gate was removed. So we have put that back to include -- increase the access for bicyclists and pedestrians who would be walking into the neighborhood versus necessarily walking down Bladensburg Road. So with that, I will just introduce Stephen. He is with STV who we have retained as the designers for this. As you may recall, they were part of the USNA perimeter fence projects, so these have been working hand in hand. And I'll'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'let Steve take the floor, so thank you very much.'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': 'Thank you, Dr. Olsen. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a few comments here. I think as we've -- as Mike presented a very comprehensive review of the project here, just a couple other things to add. As Dr. Olsen just mentioned, this project will complete the fencing security perimeter in this particular area along Bladensburg Road. So, the Perimeter Fence Replacement Project is ongoing in construction right now. So this will seamlessly tie into it on the north side from that retaining wall that serves primarily as an engineering function to retain some of that grade as we re-slope going up towards Azalea Road to the east. But then also we want to make that esthetically pleasing and tie into other walls in the area. So given the real stone treatment, you know, will be accomplished as Mike commented on. On the south side due to, as Dr. Olsen stated, the'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': 'realities of funding, the intent is really to get the infrastructure in place so the new vehicular double swing gates will be that black ornamental fence in nature, the same style fence, which is being installed elsewhere right now as part of the Perimeter Fence Replacement Project. And on the south side, there's no planned retaining wall because from an engineering standpoint, there's no need for that wall to retain the grade in that particular area. So that's some of the rationale behind, you know, where we have certain treatments. And other ones are a little bit more sticking to what's, you know, needed from a functional standpoint. I will note just for context, the bollards, which are located in front of that retaining wall, that is intended to be there more so as more of a self protection type feature for cars, which often times due to the bend'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': 'in Bladensburg Road right in that particular area for northbound traffic, there have been many times where vehicles will end up over the curb and up into that area, damaging the existing fence, which right now is just a chainlink type fence. But that is more so to preserve, you know, the infrastructure and the new wall and other facilities that will be there. And not intended to be security to secure the perimeter of the Arboretum itself right there. But without, you know, further ado, I'll open it up to any questions, you know, from the Commission at this time. I'm happy to, you know, respond to anything you may be wondering about.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Well first of all, I'd like to begin by thanking Mr. Weil, Mr. Olsen, and Mr. Kraus for this review of the concept plan for the Bladensburg Gate and Azalea Road. Before we ask for a motion to approve these comments, are there any questions for the presenters from Commissioners? Yes, Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Yeah, just one small question. I saw in the plans that along the access road there, there's a single parking space, it seemed. And I'm just wondering what the purpose of that is.'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': ' Yeah. Great question, Commissioner May. The intent of that kind of parking space right there on the west side of the new entrance road, that's intended for larger events when the Arboretum is open and they have a lot of vehicular traffic coming into that gate. That's intended for an Arboretum security vehicle to be able to be positioned there to help kind of queue and enter the traffic into the gate. You know, get it off Bladensburg Road. So it's just going to be used on a more of a temporary basis for an Arboretum security vehicle.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' And so in other times of the year when the Arboretum is very busy, does that -- I mean does it happen right now that there are long lines of people queuing to get in the gate -- in the existing entrance?'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': ' I'll take this one, Stephen and Commissioner May. Not particularly. The traffic is managed through R Street as a lot of traffic can queue at times. But the real issue is really for special events when you have to restrict access. So if it's a special event in the evening, you would have a guard there making sure that only people who have access can enter.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' Okay. So special, that's when, you know, you've rented out something and you've got people coming in after hours. All right. Thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Any other comments -- Any other questions? These are questions. We'll have comments after the motion. But a question from Commissioner Cash.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Yes. I may have missed this when we were going through the presentation. But of all the -- of all the gates that are currently open, which looks like the unnamed --Conifer Road, New York Avenue, Hickey run, R Street, which one of those -- are all those going to continue to be open as ways to get in by foot or by bike? I guess I'm asking like what are the proposed pedestrian and bike entrances going to be going forward with this new gate?'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'Right. Good question. The 2020 concept plan for the core New York Avenue gate is a service staff entrance only. There is an old pedestrian gate at what we call the Washington Times Building, which is the northeast corner. That is remaining as of now. We propose reopening the M Street Gate. And again, that gate doesn't exist anymore, so it's not a reopening, it's a reinstalling. Then you'd have the new Bladensburg Gate that we're talking. And then R Street would be the service staff entrance, pedestrian, bike. So the other thing that we didn't' mention was as early as the late 90s, the staff was already commenting on the significant cut through traffic that moves through the Arboretum for those of you that are familiar with Bladensburg Road and New York Avenue. So currently out of the safety of our staff and for the sake of the neighborhood,'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'R Street Gate is closed to vehicles at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I was leaving last night for an event and there was a stream of cars coming down R Street, trying to use their apps to cut through the Arboretum and then they have to make a U-turn through the neighborhood and re-join Bladensburg Road. So the intent there is that there will be no access to New York Avenue for vehicles because that has in the past encouraged dangerous cut-through traffic.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Madam Chair, I have a question as well.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes, Commissioner Hewlett.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Thank you. So I realize that the whole Arboretum is about 446 acres, but I have traveled down the Anacostia River commencing at Bladensburg Waterfront Park and traveled down and there was an access to the Arboretum -- a water front access. And I wanted to know a couple of things. One, even though this is 446 acres, do you envision any impact from the gate or the perimeter fencing on the Anacostia River? And I also know that the Commission reviewed an update to the Arboretum master plan in 2007 and I wasn't on the Commission then, but then you planned to reopen the waterfront access?'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': ' Yes. If I can make sure --there's a lot to unpack there, Commissioner Hewlett.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Okay.'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'With regard to waterfront access, let's start there, the river doesn't belong to me thankfully. So that was a joint project with NPS and some non-profits. I apologize. I don't remember the exact Anacostia Riverkeepers or which one who had paid for and raised funds to have a floating dock on National Park Service property. Our property ends 100 or so feet before you get to the river, so that's National Park Service property. Second issue and you are probably well aware on this is the proposed Arboretum Bridge across the Anacostia. And I don't think I need to speak to that. You are probably well informed of that. And then how does any of this change? It's really the bridge that would change. And we have accommodated in prior master plans the fact that this bridge may show up. And I think that may be a longer discussion, but'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'we are working with DDOT and others on what that bridge means and how do you get to it? There's a lot to unpack there.'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': ' One other thing I may add, Commissioner Hewlett, is on the Perimeter Fence Replacement Project, that does not replace the fence on the east side closest to the river. So there's no changes to what's existing really. The Perimeter Fence Replacement Project is on the northwest and on the south side and kinds of stops at M Street. So that's kind of the perimeter of it. So we're not actually replacing the entirety of the perimeter. There's chain link over there on the east side, but there's no changes as part of that ongoing project.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' I was concerned about the Anacostia River. I participated in cleanup there -- extensive cleanup there and have worked with the Anacostia Watershed Society. And I just wanted to make sure that what we have planned doesn't have any negative impact with trying to restore that river. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Hewlett. Commission Steingasser.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' Yes, thank you. Focusing in on the bollards that are along the gate that are protecting the retaining wall, are those just the standard concrete stubs of bollards?'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': ' They're more decorative with a black finish on them.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' I mean I guess I wonder if they're really truly necessary. And if they are truly necessary, if there isn't a way to use the wall itself in a more functional way that the bollards aren't just those concrete -- Now that I know they're black, that raises the question, are they going to even be that visible to the drivers to defer them being banged into?'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': ' Right. Good point. So we're definitely open to, you know, some other options to kind of keep the functional aspect of that, but you know, trying to, you know, integrate that as much as possible into the esthetics of kind of the entrance area and the wall. But to the other point, you know, they're obviously located, you know, off the road even beyond the sidewalk at that point. So they're not designed to be, you know a visual deterrent per se because a vehicle would be off the road, you know, by that point when they'd be, you know, heading that way anyway. But that definitely is something we can look at a little bit more to try to integrate that into kind of the landscaping esthetic.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' I would appreciate that because it does raise the question if they're that far off the road, are they necessary at all?'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'Well, if I may jump in here, Commissioner. The issue is idiots and drunk drivers. And so this is about protecting our infrastructure. Most of them we have found don't have insurance. The Government does carry insurance, so we're on the hook every time a driver leaves the roadway. We have seen it there with that intersection. So anything there needs to have some planning to accommodate that because it would become rather expensive to keep fixing that decorative stone wall if twice a year we have vehicles -- or even more -- leave the roadway. Now I do believe that with the Bladensburg safety study where they add bike lanes and some other traffic calming devices on Bladensburg Road, I'm hoping that will help, along with actually putting in the gate and having infrastructure there as proposed in the original work with DDOT that put in the road cutting'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'intersection would help. But that's the primary issue is people leaving the bars at 3:00 a.m., hitting our gate -- hitting our fence. (Simultaneous speaking.)'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' Yeah. Just re-stress my request that, that be looked at again in a way that's more integrated into the design of the fence. Thank you.'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': ' Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Steingasser. Commissioner Wright.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah. I have a question about -- So I'm assuming, but I shouldn't, did you talk to -- in making decisions about the R Street Gate, were you -- have you been consulting with the community?'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'Yeah. We're very much aware of, not lately, because it hasn't changed, but they are -- Jackie Manning was the former ANC Commissioner for the Arboretum neighborhood. We stay abreast of developments, but traffic is the single biggest issue for the neighborhood, particularly in the spring. That road was not designed -- Last weekend, one of our peak weekends, we had 7000 cars go through the two gates at the Arboretum. We had two counters --electronic eyes. So we had 21,000 people here. And two things happened currently, all that traffic has to go through R Street and the neighborhood. DDOT has not listened -- has not taken -- has not proposed any solutions to the neighborhood that is acceptable to the neighborhood like permit parking or other things. Because the other thing that happens is when our gates close at 2:00 or we're just busy and people know, they'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': 'will park throughout the neighborhood in lieu of going around that gate.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' So I get all that. But I mean I kind of -- But have you talked to them about obviously -- I mean I think it's probably --it's self-evident that they probably are very welcoming of the idea of closing that gate to vehicular traffic. However, has the secondary use for bikes and pedestrians been discussed with them too? And I guess what I'm getting at is was there -- was there -- do they have a -- have they had any say in the decision making regarding what happens next when Bladensburg Road becomes the primary entrance and they become secondary? Did they have any ideas about what they'd like to see there?'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': ' Yeah. So were they informed or were they -- did they participate? They participated through the 2020-2021, whatever the date we used, concept plan for the core framework. And probably the biggest changes there that we heard from the neighborhoods was the reopening of the M Street Gate for pedestrians and bicyclists. The redevelopment of the area means there's a lot more folks. And currently that gate for the Arboretum neighborhood is left almost -- the idea of reopening that as a pedestrian is so that folks that are literally one block away from the Arboretum can continue to access the Arboretum without having to go to Bladensburg Road. So it's all been coordinated.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' So will the -- will the gate visually signal to the cars who want to cut through and have been cutting through, is it going to be on Bladensburg Road and R Street, is that -- how are you going to signal to the would be cutter throughers that they can't cut through anymore on Bladensburg?'",
        "'DR. OLSEN': ' That would be taken care of on the apps. What they're using is the apps that show a connection to New York Avenue or the gate that's open. So as Michael referenced, as part of any future work, no operational -- the operations of the gate will come -- The changes of the operations of the gate will occur until everything is finalized and approved and everything is installed. And at that point, there will be -- If we ever get to that day, then we would have obviously a communication plan and signage plan and other things already in place so that we can -- we can make the change.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Thank you.'",
        "'MR. KRAUS': ' One other thing I'll offer kind of to that point, Commissioner Wright, is the neighborhoods have been invited as part of the Section 106 process for this project to participate. We've had one formal meeting thus far. I don't believe we've had any of the neighborhood associations participate in there, but I believe we did have some participation as part of the Perimeter Fence Project, which is, you know, related to it. So we have been trying to actively, you know, reach out and invite them to consult and offer their, you know, thoughts and opinions, you know, throughout the process as we're still in design and have an opportunity to inform things.'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Are there any further questions on the presentation? If not, I want to thank Mr. Weil, Mr. Olsen, and Mr. Kraus for presenting the concept plan today. And I'll bring it back to the table for the Commission discussion. If you could, turn on your cameras if you haven't and I would entertain a motion to approve the concept plans for the National Arboretum's Bladensburg Gate and Azalea Road Improvements Proposal. Is there a motion?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Madam Chair, I move approval of the concept plan.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Hewlett. And is there a second?'",

        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': ' I second.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' You seconded that. Okay, fine. Thank you. Then that motion has been made and seconded. So now I'm going to start with Commissioner May and go round robin and have a Commission discussion about the presentation.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Right. So first of all, I really welcome new submissions on the improvements to the Arboretum. And I really feel the pain of having to do this in pieces, rather than, you know executing -- being able to execute a full master plan because of the challenges that the Arboretum faces. So Dr. Olsen, you have my sympathy in trying to make all these things happen. It's really a challenge. And I will say also I agree with all of the comments that are in the EDR, particular comments about the design of the gate because I do think that the gate has to look like it's appropriate for this magnificent facility. It would be a shame to just have, you know, a regular tubular metal, you know, swing gate because that's all that could be afforded. And if there's -- you know, if there's some dollar limit on what'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'might be fundable in this circumstance, I would encourage that the team look at other aspects of the project that might be -- where there might be room to cut in order to make a better gate. Because I mean I just have a feeling -- and this is just a feeling, that if you make something really good and it really just announces the Arboretum, which for so many people is like buried treasure. They don't really understand it and appreciate it. But if you really announce it --and I know, you know, Bladensburg Road is not Pennsylvania Avenue, but it's a heavily trafficked road and almost everybody knows that it's there, the road anyway. You know, many, many people have gone down there. And I just think it's a way to announce to the city that, you know, this wonderful facility is here. And it's not the place'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'to go cheap on the gate. It's also not the place to come up with an inadequate design solution for that gate where in order to protect a stone-clad concrete wall, you have to put bollards in front of it. And I understand the challenge. I mean we have this challenge too. People can be incredibly stupid when they're behind the wheel, especially if they're under the influence of something. And we have this problem regularly in parklands throughout the city where people drive into things. And I have to believe that there's a better solution than building a stone clad concrete wall and then popping some bollards in front of it. And you know, that may have to do with, you know, other protections that could be built into the -- into that entrance that are actually of a piece with it. It could also involve using rustic fence'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'and materials. You know, the idea that you have to have a large retaining wall that's covered with stone cladding that, you know, will easily break off when struck by a vehicle. I mean maybe that's just not the right solution. Maybe there needs to be, you know, some sort of concrete finish up to a certain point and then a stone finish above that, that draws inspiration from the stone that exists elsewhere on the campus. I feel like there are other solutions that can be found. And you know, no offense to the design team that's working on it, but you know, what I've seen in this regard in terms of the gate is a little bit uninspired just from an esthetic perspective. So I think that, you know, it may be something where a little bit more investment in some higher level design expertise or people who'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'are more attuned to the architecture of the -- landscape architecture of the Arboretum might do a better job integrating this. Because this just feels like it's just an engineering solution. It's functional. It works. It's uninspired. And I think you need something inspirational here. Otherwise, I mean I think I love the idea that -- I really appreciate trying to move some of things forward. You know, I travel down Bladensburg Road frequently and so -- and every time I go by it, I just long for the day when that gate is going to be there and be open and I think it's going to be wonderful when it's done. So that's it. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Commissioner Argo.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Sorry.'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Commissioner Wright.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Well of course I have comments. I would like to second Mr. May's opinions. I think the entrance -- I think the whole purpose of this is to create, you know, not a ceremonial entrance, but there's a lot of symbolism involved. And I think the current design is -- I was not going to say uninspiring. It just falls short of the mark in terms of it could be a lot more elegant. I don't understand the bollards in front of the wall at all. And I would second his suggestion that you look at hardening the wall or going -- dispensing with the stone all together and look at something -- at the design of something really beautiful that's hardened and in metal. Because it just -- So if you're going to go with the stone, I would also concur with the EDR, which suggests a certain amount'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'of symmetry. Right now it kind of seems like it can't decide what it wants to be. It's sort of back of house, but not really. It's halfway ceremonial, but not really. So I think it has to be considered more holistically with what announcements it's trying to make. And particularly in concert with the R Street -- the solution for R Street because they state two things. I mean I get what you said, Mr. Olsen about the apps, but not everybody -- I know it's hard to believe, not everybody's using a GPS app. Some people are just gutting it out in rush hour and they see that, you know, that -- I've been in that line trying to make a right to New York Avenue. So I think that I would recommend that you reconsider both solutions in tandem and have them work together. And not necessarily'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'rely on an online set of directions and be a little -- think more intuitively about what each gate -- what functions you see each entrance implementing. Because I just think it's -- it's a shame. And there's also a noticeable dearth of landscape in the design, which seems odd for the Arboretum.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Commissioner Dixon please.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'Yes. Thank you very much. First, I join with my commissioners about the quality and the design of the wall. I think it's a monumental opportunity in a way to commemorate and make this wonderful space attractive and the entrance attractive. I also have a special feeling because my first home I had was in that neighborhood. It was in one of the apartment buildings right near the Arboretum. And I used to use that place as a place to run and jog in those days when I was running and jogging. So I have a special historic connection and like to think of it really as another amenity for that community that they can access with no issues and should access and feel like they can access it. It was almost like our enlarged backyard -- a really spectacular backyard. So I'm glad that the community was involved. I'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'hope you'll keep them involved. And I do think we ought to try to make the specialness of it reflected in this wall -- this gate that's being built. Thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. Commissioner Cash. Yes, sir.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I also want to mention, it was brought up about the water access. I hope that, that still happens. I think it's a great concept to have folks come in by water by the Anacostia River and be able to step off and go into such a related natural space. So I hope they can make that happen successfully.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' That's a great suggestion, Commissioner Dixon. Thank you. Commissioner Cash.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Yeah, I have a few comments. So I've been looking at the right a lot. I'm looking at the Google Maps view of this, particularly where this gate is going to go. And indeed there is a very, very, very large 100 foot long curb cut. And the thing that strikes me immediately in seeing the existing condition and what's being proposed is there doesn't seem to be a lot of thought that's been put into how we're going to manage pedestrians getting across that 100 foot curb cut. And it does look like from the street view that there is -- there's currently a crosswalk that traverses the six lanes or seven lanes of Bladensburg Road if you're going northbound right before you get to the curb cut. So it looks like there already has been a crosswalk installed. But it looks like the infrastructure is also there that's'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'it's going to be a signalized intersection, which I would think it would have to be for anyone making a left turn in or even a right. So the thing that strikes me if this is going to be signalized, which it should be in any event, I think that really cuts down on the concern that we have about these northbound cars crashing into the wall. Like it should slow down the traffic on Bladensburg and hopefully kind of reduce that possibility. So I just hope that when you're working with DDOT and working with the District on transportation management, assuming that there is going to be some infrastructure going in here to signalize the intersection, I think that really alleviates the concern about the wall being hit. So I hope when you're going back and looking at the bollards and looking at even the need for them, that'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'we're taking into account that future condition that I assume will be there. The only other plug that I wanted to give, because no one's really talked about the interior roads, I appreciate that EDR calls into question the need for two-way traffic. I think that's something that still needs to be looked at. And to the extent that any of these interior roads are being repaved, I hope that the Arboretum can look to see if it's feasible for more porous materials that we can put down, instead of just that black really hot tar roadway that's in there now that I know, especially in the summer can get hot. So I hope that you're using all these opportunities as a chance to say let's not just repave the road. Let's see if there's a way in the budget that we can make that road actually better, especially for'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'a site like this. Because I think that EDR did mention some storm water concerns, so that was the first thing that popped to mind to take care the opportunity if you're going to be tearing up the road because you might not get this for another 25 years. So those are the comments and observations I have, so thanks.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' Yes. I really do want to associate myself with all of the comments that have been made about the design and the missed opportunity to really announce the presence of this gate and the entrance to the Arboretum. It is such a great opportunity and it just hasn't been embellished. And I also agree with Commissioner Cash's comments about the interior and the two-way traffic and the widening of the street and that's raised in the EDR as well. And I also just want to reinforce this issue of the bollards. And note that in the EDR, these are issues that are actually underlined and it seems very polite and it's a very nice thin line. But it's really a point of serious emphasis that I look forward to seeing how it gets addressed in the future. Thank you.'",

Thank you, Director Olsen and Michael and our project manager Kraus -- Stephen Kraus for your presentation. I think all of the comments have been good. I think -- I hope you find them helpful. I do also support the Executive Director's report on this. It's an awesome opportunity. And arboretums are near and dear to Americans hearts, I believe. They're very supported in communities across the country. I do agree that some of the design elements, taking another look at the entrance, at the gate, at the bollards and that whole sense of arrival is going to be important. So I look forward to seeing it come back with the design evolution as perhaps could reflect some of our comments today. But also I look forward to the transportation results because it is a very'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': '-- the transportation analysis and results because I think it's going to be key to have that entrance safe. But also the interior roads, I think it will be good to take another look at the widening of the roads and at the permeability of those surfaces too as someone else pointed out. So again, thank you. I think good comments came from the Commission. And we look forward to seeing the next iteration. So thank you very much. And so now we have a motion on the floor. It is seconded. And if there are no further comments -- Are there any more comments? Hearing none, Ms. Koster, could you please confirm the motion and second and call the roll?'",

        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'Thank you. So good afternoon, Chair Goodman and members of the Commission. The Department of the Navy has submitted concept plans for a new 115,000 square foot six-story bachelor enlisted quarters and support facility, which will include barrack history of 250 enlisted personnel, as well as administrative offices, a non-commissioned officer's club, fitness facilities, and the post primary food hall. The spaces within this facility will replace outdated and cost-ineffective facilities currently located in Building 20 on I Street Southeast just north of I-695. Marine Barracks Washington includes the main post, which is historic and located on H Street Southeast and the Sousa Annex, which is not historic and a block to the west and south of 695 -- I-695. The project site is located within the Sousa Annex at 1053 7th Street Southeast Washington D.C. Here is an image of the I Street Barracks building currently housing the functions'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'that will be moved to the new facility in the Sousa Annex we are discussing today. The Sousa Annex is 8.22 acres founded by L Street Southeast to the south, 7th Street Southeast to the east, Virginia Avenue Southeast to the north, and K Street Southeast to the west. The annex parking garage structure borders the subject property to the west. The 2.5 acre project site will be in the middle of the overall property immediately adjacent to Building 25 to the south and east, the athletic field and running track to the north, and the parking garage to the west. As this is a concept review, the focus of today's presentation and analysis is to receive Commission comments and feedback prior to preparation of a more detailed preliminary submission. In this case, the focus of the review is understanding the appropriateness of the project for the site, in context,'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'understanding any particular unique or complex issues that need to be addressed, and identifying any stakeholders that may need to be further involved. As such, in today's presentation, the staff will identify comments for the Commission to adopt as guidance for further project development. Now let's look at some photographs of the Sousa Annex Campus. Here is a photo of the existing site showing Building 25, the annex parking garage, and the athletic field. I will note that the building to the north and right of the K Street Gate you see to the right in this image is a senior citizen residence and not part of the Sousa Complex. And here are additional photos showing the existing annex, parking garage, and Building 25. Here are other views of Building 25. The proposed facility will be adjacent to and connect with the existing residential and support uses located in Building'",

In addition, staff notes that the proposed barracks concept design draws upon the architectural vernacular of the adjacent Building 25, which includes brick elevations with cast stone lintels and arches, cross hipped roof lines, and an asymmetrical tower element. This slide shows an aerial of the Sousa Annex with Building 25 labeled. And the asphalt basketball court is located in the southwest corner of the site, as well as the outdoor exercise area just north of Building 25. The project location for the new barracks building was identified in the Marine Barracks Washington Master Plan, which was approved by the Commission in 2018. Development alternatives for the barracks project are limited given the constraints of the site due to Building 25, site access, maintaining the athletic field, and'",

Staff notes that in 2002, the Navy and the National Park Service signed a covenant that identified the K and Sixth Street rights of way as protected viewsheds and designated the recreation space be accessible for public use and in perpetuity, which results in constraints regarding the placement of the proposed facility. For the concept plans, concrete sidewalks will provide pedestrian circulation around the site, a concrete retaining wall will be used on the north portion of the site because the athletic fields are approximately four feet above the proposed facilities finished floor elevations. A 20-foot access drive and turnaround have been added to facilitate vehicular flow entering from the K Street Security Gate. The emergency vehicle access connects to an existing reinforced fire lane accessed from the existing emergency gate on L Street. Here are images that were included in the master plan approved by the'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'Commission in 2018. Staff finds that the proposed building location and massing are generally consistent with the initial concepts described in the Marine Barracks Washington Master Plan. The footprint avoids intruding on the protected viewsheds. Here are images of the elevations of the proposed building. The applicant has indicated that they are treating the new building as an addition to Building 25 and using the existing design language as a basis for the architectural approach for this building. Here's a rendering of the new building viewed from Virginia Avenue. While the design of the barracks has evolved from what was shown in the master plan, the use of historically influenced design elements such as the cross-cable pedimented roofs at the corners and over the main entrance, as well as the modified Palladian-style window in the entrance bay can be challenging when applied to a modern building of this size, height,'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'and mass. Here is another rendering of the building viewed from 7th Street and Virginia Avenue with the existing Building 25 and its asymmetrical tower on the left side of the image. The window patterning with limited glazing leads to a somewhat stark facade. While staff recognizes and supports the program needs for the new barracks, staff finds that the proposed architecture will benefit from further improvement such that the scale and proportion of the design elements are appropriate for a modern building of this size and height. And as such, requests that the applicant explore the following: revising the architectural treatment of the applied pediment at the entrances and the roofline at the corners to make them less prominent and also exploring increasing the number or size of windows, particularly for the dorm rooms, thereby improving the solid to void ratio and increasing the access to daylighting for residence.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'In addition, further information about the landscape approach will be necessary for the next review. The landscape should help improve the residence experience and create a unified setting for this portion of the campus. Shade trees and ornamental plantings integrated with storm water management, best management practices can help enhance the sight. Therefore, staff request that the applicant provide a detailed landscape plan for the next submission to include shade trees and ornamental plantings that will beautify the site and enhance the resident quality of life. Staff notes that the athletic field size and configuration will be altered from the existing conditions. However, the process for permitting public access will not change. The applicant should ensure users are aware of future changes to the site. As such, staff recommends that the applicant continue to coordinate with athletic field users and community organizations so that they were aware of the upcoming'",

Further, staff recommends that the applicant coordinate with the District Department of Energy and Environment regarding the proposed storm water management strategy and any related permitting requirements.

I would like to introduce Lieutenant Alex Cinq Mars with the Marine Barracks Washington to make some brief remarks. And will note that Theresa Perala and members of the Design Team are here to help answer any questions the Commission may have. Thank you.'",
        "'LT. CINQ MARS': 'Good afternoon. Thank you, Lee. I appreciate your presentation this afternoon. And good afternoon, Chair Goodmann and the Commissioners. On behalf of the Marine Barracks, I'd like to personally thank you for your time this afternoon to review our proposed enlisted quarters and support facility. As was alluded to, this future construction effort is meant to directly enhance and improve the lives of our 1,200 personnel that work here, along with those 250 residents with particular focus on those junior enlisted folks. As has been noted, the existing barracks on I Street were built over 50 years ago. Changes in the city environment and significant aging have resulted in multiple deficiencies. So this new construction effort is an attempt to take care of those deficiencies with the most prominent being our anti-terrorism force protection measures that our troops are currently exposed to. We understand the relocation of the Marines from'",
        "'LT. CINQ MARS': 'their existing facility that we call the Towers will have a significant impact on the community, especially during the construction phase, but we're interested in doing everything we can to mitigate any negative impacts that this project may bring. While we have been working with other agencies as well, we've received extremely valuable feedback to improve the design. And we look forward to your feedback, in addition to what's already been mentioned in this presentation. We look forward to your different perspectives and how they can continue --how we can continue to refine this design. And without any further delay, I'd like to introduce our designer, Ms. Theresa Perala. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'MS. PERALA': 'Thank you, Lieutenant Cinq Mars. On behalf of the Design Team and Marine barracks, we appreciate the opportunity to meet with the commissioners today as we continue to evolve the design to further improve what has been developed on designing a facility that will ultimately enhance the quality of life of the Marines and complement the neighborhood. We have received valuable input as Lieutenant Cinq Mars has noted from other agencies, specifically the CFA Commission and the NCPC staff that we are working to incorporate in upcoming submissions such as further evaluation of the windows and the treatment of them, the roofline at the central bay, and development of additional landscaping features. While trying to do all that, we're also very conscious of the project building site and how it's constrained within the three viewsheds of 6th Street, K Street, and Virginia Avenue. And also honoring many of the utilities'",
        "'MS. PERALA': 'that are running within that site. But regardless, we will continue to work with the staff at each agency, so that we can continue to evolve the design so that we have a project that we can be very proud of ultimately. So is there any questions from the Commissioners? As Lieutenant Cinq Mars has mentioned, we have members from our design team, Mr. Buck Monroe who's the lead architect, Mr. Steve Schad who is our civil engineer, and our other project manager for the facility, Ms. Abbe Little all available to answer any of the questions that you may have. So thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Ms. Perala. Thank you, Mr. Webb and Lieutenant Mars. I appreciate that presentation. Now do we have any questions from the Commissioners? Hearing no questions from the Commissioners -- I'll ask one more time. Any questions from the Commissioners? I don't see any hands up. Hearing no questions, we'll bring it back to the Commission. And is there a motion to approve comments on the concept plans for the Marine Barracks Washington bachelor enlisted quarters? (Simultaneous speaking.)'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Second.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' It's been moved and seconded. Thank you. And I'll start with Commissioner McMahon for comments. Any comments, Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' I think just a historical mention years ago, I wore a uniform and I was a civil engineer and I was in charge of what was in EFA Chesapeake. I was overseeing broadly because we had a great staff there. The original construction of the first barracks there on that site. So it's nice to see its continued development and I appreciate the efforts from the NAVFAC Washington Team to support the Marine Corps come forward with a proposal to meet Marine Corps requirements albeit excessive to the needs of the site. That's all I've got.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much, Commissioner McMahon. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Thank you. So I'm glad to see this project continuing to move forward. I know there are challenges in Building 20. I'm looking forward to, you know, the day when that building can go away and there's a nice new facility to replace it. I have to say, I mean I live very close to this and I see the existing Building 25 all the time. And it is a bit of a period piece and it's not a period from that long ago. Right? I mean it's 20 years old and it's like the tail end of post modernism or something like that. It's not -- It's probably not the -- Well, it's certainly not the best building in Washington. And it was a somewhat awkward application of these historicist features onto a building that didn't really lend itself to it. So it's okay because it's still modest in'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'scale, but when you take those same architectural treatments and you know, you blow it out to twice the size, it really, really doesn't work at all. And I don't want to go into this in great detail because I think you've gotten good feedback from the Commission of Fine Arts. I happened to listen to some of that discussion a couple of weeks ago. And I think they're all being very polite about it. And I will say, you know, we've had, you know, just in the last meeting, we had another discussion of the architecture not being up to snuff for the context of where it was. And in that case, I think it was really, really far off. This is not as far off. I mean the building massing is pretty well defined, but it's the treatment of the building and how -- I don't want to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'use the word -- it's more than decoration, but how it is -- how the form of the building and the treatment of the facades, the treatment of the windows need to be better aligned with the mass of that building. And there are lots of other big buildings in that area. And I almost have to question whether doing something that is so closely tied to a 20 year old, you know, late post modern building is the right strategy at all. It's not just about getting rid of the pediments. It's rethinking, you know, the solid to void relationships, the use of any arches. You know, it can be a really interesting building, but it doesn't have to be a -- it doesn't have to be a true signature building. It can be sort of the background building to the rest of that -- of that area. And'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'I think a more -- I mean, I'd say frankly a more modern approach to the building probably would be helpful in making it look better on that site. I mean I just -- when you look at the one rendering, I think it was on Page 14 where, you know, you're looking at the view of it from Virginia Avenue across the field, it is so prominent, so big, and so weirdly out of scale. And so anyway, I'd take a significant look at that. I mean again, the staff report says the right things and I just want to emphasize those things. I think it's -- I think it's not that far to go, but you do have to kind of re-think your basis in my opinion. And of course, I also agree with the comments about the landscape design too because it's --even now, it's quite bare.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'And much more can be done to make that entire campus fit better into that neighborhood. It's not an easy neighborhood to fit into because you've got the freeway right next to it and it's elevated and all that. But you know, doing something there to make it feel more comfortable within the neighborhood is essential. And I'll just say I'm glad to know that there aren't going to be changes in how the field is going to be used and available to the community. That was critical from when the National Park Service transferred land to make the original project possible. I know that early on there were challenges in making that happen to begin with. I got a lot of complaints from people about how it was not accessible. And I think if anything, it could become more accessible to the community and that would be a good'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'thing, but I'm not pushing for any changes to the EDR to push in that direction. So anyway, I've talked enough. Thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. I appreciate your remarks. Commissioner Argo.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' I have to say that's what I'm going to miss the most about Peter is that he goes right before me in the lineup and takes care of everything, you know, in a most insightful, you know, penetrating way. And you know, it's on the one hand, it doesn't leave me much. On the other hand, I so appreciate his expertise and his insights. So it gave me a chance to say that. And I have -- I really don't have anything to add. I think all the comments here have been -- on this project have been in a little more detailed way, really hopefully useful to the applicant. And I don't have anything to add beyond that. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Very good. Thank you, Commissioner Argo. Vice Chair Hewlett please.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER HEWLETT': ' Thank you. I would just -- I don't have anything to add really, except that I concur with the comments. And I particularly concur with the sentiment of Commissioner Argo about Commissioner May. So that's where I'll leave it. Thank you so much.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Thank you so much, Vice Chair Hewlett. And Commissioner Green.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'Thank you very much. Now I mean I really appreciate the efforts of the applicant to design a building that fits its setting that uses the historic cues around it. But it does kind of point out the problem of -- the challenge of designing a building in a context where the contextual building to which you were attaching just isn't very good and is itself a reduction of the buildings around it. And you can only make that move so many times and then you run out of things -- material to work with. You know, things such as, you know, the changing materials when you get to the top story, it's modestly successful in a four story building, but not at all successful with the scale of this building. But the effort's right and you know, I like the idea -- their approach of trying to give it,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'it's own character and not trying to make it -- not trying to make it go away. Not trying to reduce its character. Because at the scale it is, it's going to be its own thing. You know, and it will not read as an addition to the building to which it's attempting to be an addition. But I think that's the road to go, I think to look to its own character. And I think actually -- ironically, one of the most successful buildings in the slide presentation is the retirement home across the street, which really handled some of those challenges of getting tall and breaking into bays and pulling fenestration into pairs. And really, it's quite a successful building in many regards. So I think there's a lot right here. There's a lot to build on. And I like a lot of the moves that are being'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'made, but it just -- as my fellow commissioners have said, it needs refinement. It needs to really be, I think, thought of as its own --to become its own thing. And I look forward to seeing the next iteration. Thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Green. Commissioner Wright please.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Yeah, I would say much -- many of the same things. It's sort of like an ungainly maiden aunt right now. And it doesn't necessarily have to be a star building. I mean if you don't -- I'm assuming that the program requires all the square footage that those pediments are -- you know, those raised pediments are taking up. But if that's -- So if you're stuck with that, the only other suggestion I would make in addition to what Mr. May was talking about is possibly mitigating some of its bulk by giving the facade a little bit more texture and depth. Like a window reveal would go a long way for example. Just to break up some of, you know, it is sort of reminiscent of those late post modern buildings that basically kind of got -- it was so reductivist that it kind of looked like'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': '-- oh, what's the word I want to use? I can't think of one. But very flat and two dimensional, like a building on paper where the contours of all of the architectural elements were there, but they had no depth and no gravity. Therefore no meaning. And so I would -- I would re-visit your vocabulary a little bit if you can. And I agree, it's not nearly in the same boat as what we looked at in the last meeting. I think it's got -- it's fixable, but it -- and you are suffering from having to riff off of a building that isn't very good. So maybe stop doing that and thinking about a vocabulary that doesn't -- that speaks to the vocabulary of the other building, but doesn't necessarily riff off of it so directly.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Commissioner Dixon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I share a lot of the views of my colleagues and I have no further comments. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. Commissioner Cash.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'I just really want to associate myself with the comments about the design. I mean we keep talking about that there's some relationship to Building 25. The thing that I can't get over is it looks like it's a bigger residential version of the parking garage from next door. And I know the parking garage was in the master plan. We can't go back 15 years and fix all that, so we're left with the site we're left with. But I do think that some of the views as I'm looking through these slides, like it's actually a really prominent spot to put something architecturally more interesting like the top of this kind of artificial hill above the field. And it just -- I'm getting very suburban vibes when I look at this. And I also have to say when I first look at this, I live in the Thomas'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Circle neighborhood and there's a Homewood Suites right at 15th and Massachusetts. And this just is screaming that to me. So I really think that we should use this opportunity to maybe put something more interesting there. Something to kind of break up the 1990s monotony of this campus. And Commissioner Green mentioned the Arthur Capper Campus. I think that we need to look to be more creative like that. There's other neighborhood context, not just within the fence. So I understand the programmatic needs, but it would be nice to see something a little bit more inspiring in this neighborhood that's really taking off. So that's my comments.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Commissioner Davis.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' I have nothing to add. Thanks.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Davis. Commissioner Steingasser.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' I have nothing additional to add except that my -- I do want to state my agreement with all of the comments, both in the staff report and stated here with my other commissioners.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Steingasser. And to close, I would just like to say, you know, we all acknowledge this is a very important project and we appreciate the service of those who will use the facility. And I appreciate the staff comments and Commissioners comments. And I hope that it's provided some additional input for you all as we move to the next -- the next phase of this project and move forward with the design. So I just want to again thank everyone for your comments. Commissioner May.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'Yeah. I just wanted to pick up on something that Commissioner Green mentioned about the senior building directly to the west. And what I find interesting about that is not so much that, you know, stylistically an approach like that would be appropriate, but it's the idea that what is happening in that building is that they have taken forms that are typically associated with smaller buildings and applied it to a larger building in a way that really looks good. And it's got these echos of, you know, small tudor houses and things like that, which are just, you know, really -- they're like, you know, the comfort food of architecture. But then to apply that into a building that's that big, I think is -- you know, it was done very well. And so, you know, I think there are lessons to be learned from that. It's clearly'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MAY': 'not something to be imitated directly either because that would be a weird mismatch. But I think that was a really insightful point and I wanted to drive that home a little bit.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner May. Are there any other questions or comments from the Commission? Any further comments from the Commission? Hearing none, Ms. Koster, could you confirm the motion and call the roll please.'",
