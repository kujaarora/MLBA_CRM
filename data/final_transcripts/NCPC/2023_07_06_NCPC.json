        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'We're very, very happy you joined us, Ryan. So welcome. Also on Thursday, June 15, the Department of the Army hosted several officials from the Department of Defense, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the Department of the Interior, and the National Capital Planning Commission to tour the general officer's quarters at Fort McNair. The purpose of the tour was to discuss programmatic solutions to the management of the pre-1919 historic housing Army-wide. As a reminder, the Commission reviewed the draft housing -- I'm sorry -- reviewed the draft master plan for Joint Base Myer-Henderson that includes Fort McNair and provided comments at the February Commission meeting. The main point of discussion was the language. In the FY23 National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA, requiring demolition of three general officer's quarters in addition to the potential impact of sea level rise on those quarters. The tour was an important first'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'step, I believe, in discussing how to address the significant needs of this historic housing. And I look forward to contributing to future discussions. So I just want you all to be aware of that. And I'm happy to speak to any of you about that at any time. And Agenda Item No. 3 is a report of the executive director, Mr. Acosta.'"

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Wonderful. Thank you, Ms. Koster. The motion has carried. And so agenda item No. 6A is to approve comments on the National 9-11 Pentagon Memorial Visitor Education Center. And today, Ms. Herr is going to be making that presentation. So just a reminder if you'd like to mute and turn off your videos, we'll hear the presentation from Ms. Herr.'",
        "'MS. HERR': ' Yes, thank you. Can you see the screen?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes, we can.'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'Great. Good afternoon, Chair Goodman and members of the Commission. Arlington National Cemetery on behalf of the Pentagon Memorial Fund has submitted concept plans for the 9-11 Pentagon Memorial Visitor Education Center in Arlington, Virginia. As this is a concept review, the focus of today's presentation and analysis is to receive Commission comments and feedback prior to preparation of a more detailed preliminary submission. In this case, the focus of the review is understanding the appropriateness of the project for the site and context, understanding any particularly unique or complex issues that need to be addressed, and identifying any stakeholders that need to be further involved. On September 11th, 2001, terrorists hijacked airliners while in flight with the intent of crashing them into targets in New York City and Washington, D.C. One of those planes, Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon, killing 184 people. Memorials have been constructed at each'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'site affected by the 9-11 attacks, including the National 9-11 Pentagon Memorial dedicated in 2008 and noted here. Visitor centers have also been established in both New York City and Shanksville, Pennsylvania to provide educational exhibitions that tell the story of attacks at their respective locations. To help provide a better understanding of the events at the Pentagon on September 11, the Pentagon Memorial Fund is proposing to construct the 9-11 Pentagon Memorial Visitor Education Center at the location noted here. The proposed site is located north of I-395 and Washington Boulevard west of the Pentagon and the Pentagon 9-11 Memorial as noted here. The site pictured here slopes downhill from southwest to northeast. The low point of the site is at the corner of Columbia Pike and the on-ramp to Washington Boulevard. The existing Air Force Memorial is located to the west of the site. As the site is'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'under construction, there are no existing trees. The proposed Visitor Education Center is part of the southern expansion of Arlington National Cemetery. The Commission previously approved this expansion. The roads in this area are currently under construction as part of the approved Defense Access road project. As part of these projects, the intersection at Columbia Pike and South Joyce Street and the interchange with Washington Boulevard will be modified. The reconfiguration of these roads will create the site for the proposed project as noted here. The site will be bounded by the realigned Columbia Pike to the north, South Joyce Street to the west, and Washington Boulevard to the east and south. The existing 9-11 Pentagon Memorial is located on the other side of Washington Boulevard. A previous version of the Visitor Education Center was presented to NCPC staff and the Commission of Fine Arts. The building was originally proposed'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'at the top of the hill toward the southern end of the site with a large parking lot extending between the building and the Memorial. NCPC staff and the Commission of Fine Arts commented that the building was too large and prominent give the context adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. The parking lot in its location gives too much preference to vehicles. The materials did not coordinate with Arlington National Cemetery. And there wasn't enough attention paid to the pedestrian experience. This is the current proposed site plan. The plan includes a 50,000 square foot Visitor Education Center and a 100-space parking lot. The applicant has significantly modified the design based on feedback from staff and the Commission of Fine Arts. And while additional refinement is necessary, staff recommends the Commission approve the comments contained in the report. I will now review the details of the proposal. The site is'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'designed so visitors traveling by bus, car, or bike arrive via one of two right in, right out entrances to the site, one on South Joyce Street, the other on Columbia Pike. The two entries lead via a wide entry drive and bus drop off to the parking lot and building entry. The parking lot of 100 spaces is less than the previous iteration and has shifted south of the building. At the northern end of the parking lot is a parking lot landing pictured here in this rendering. Staff suggests the Commission recommends the applicant continue to minimize the parking areas and differentiate these spaces, especially the areas dedicated to the visitor experience which are currently designed as part of the parking lot with no connection to the building and building yard and requests the applicant submit the rationale for the amount of visitor parking, differentiating between the spaces'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'for the museum and spaces for the conference rooms. Across the wide entry drive to the north is the proposed Visitor Education Center building. Upon entering the building from the parking lot, visitors will descend through a glazed atrium on axis with the Memorial, the staircase to the ground floor, and then main exhibit space. As recommended by staff and the Commission of Fine Arts, the building is integrated into the existing topography which minimizes the height of the building and gives deference to the Arlington National Cemetery. The outline of the previous design is visible here higher on the hill. Additionally, locating the building at the bottom of the hill closest to the Memorial, emphasizes the building as the primary use of the site. The main entry facing the parking area is the second floor because it is designed into the topography. The Visitor Center will include exhibits and'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'programs to engage visitors and public as to the effects and broad impact of the tragedy from a variety of perspectives including details of the individuals who died, the response from the United States and partner countries in the days, weeks, and months that followed, as well as the design of the memorial and it significance. There are also comfortable amenities such as restrooms, shelter for visitors, a caf\u201a, a bookstore, and a multi- purpose conference center space which will be used for both daytime conferences and evening events. After touring the exhibition, the visitor exits through the doors on the north facade and proceeds to the memorial itself. Walking to the memorial requires crossing Columbia Pike, the on-ramp to Washington Boulevard westbound, walking under the overpass of Washington Boulevard, crossing the on-ramp to Washington Boulevard eastbound, walking along the Pentagon secure fence, and then into the memorial area as'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'noted here by the red line. Visitors traveling by foot can also enter the building from the memorial facing entrance on the first floor. Staff recommends the Commission requests the applicant coordinate with applicable local and federal transportation agencies to ensure the route between a Visitor Center to the memorial prioritizes pedestrian safety over vehicular level of service. In addition, staff 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 suggests the Commission requests for a preliminary review that the applicant share progress with the Commission regarding the proposed improvements for the route between the memorial and the new Visitor Center. The proposed landscape design for the Visitor Center is intended to be sympathetic to its context and proximity to Arlington National Cemetery. The applicant has indicated that they created exterior places for people to gather, pause,'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'and reflect. Sidewalks will be installed around the perimeter of the site as well as through the site to promote safe pedestrian access in connection. Visitors arriving by bus, car, or bike will be directed to the parking lot. Staff notes that there are very few trees included on the east side of the site against the Washington Boulevard on-ramp and suggests the Commission recommends additional trees to provide shade and better blend the site in with the existing tree canopy of Arlington National Cemetery. For the proposed building design, the applicant has taken design inspiration from the existing structures and design elements at Arlington National Cemetery. The proposed proportions of the building are inspired by the forms at Arlington National Cemetery as indicated here. The applicant also looked to the existing 9-11 Pentagon Memorial as inspiration. A proposed building is broken down into a series of repeating 30-foot modules'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'that when viewed in plan are intended to reflect the repeating benches of the Memorial. The building's roof form seen from the air makes reference to Flight 77 in the form of two 7s. The proposed materials include pre- cast concrete, glazing, and metal. It is inspired by the character of Arlington National Cemetery. Staff notes the proposed design is conceptual and the applicant has stated that they will make additional refinements to the building sign based on the NCPC and CFA reviews and suggests the Commission recommend to the applicant to continue to refine the design of the building and in particular to reevaluate the building entry and southwest building facade with a focus on creating a sense of hierarchy and prominence that will help guide visitors; to consider avoiding literal design gestures which may be inadvertently limiting and unnecessary given the setting and purpose; and to demonstrate through'",
        "'MS. HERR': 'studies and renderings how the building material palette will complement the established character of Arlington National Cemetery. This concludes my presentation. I have incorporated recommendations throughout the presentation, so I will not read them again. But I have included them here for your reference. Overall, the Commission supports the concept plan, but there are several areas of concern that are noted in the recommendations that will need to be addressed before the next submission. Thank you, and I'm available to answer any questions you may have. Jim Laychak from the Pentagon Memorial Fund is here with a brief statement and then there's a design team at Fentress Architects and EHT Traceries are available to answer questions as well. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. LAYCHAK': ' My name is Jim Laychak, and I thank you for the opportunity to talk about this project. My brother was killed on the Pentagon on 9-11. And as been stated and as people have mentioned, this is the only attack site -- even though we were first memorial created, the only attack site without a visitor education center. The Pentagon Memorial Fund is working to change this. Many visitors, especially children born after the tragedy, have no memory of 9-11 and don't fully understanding its significance and how our country responded after the attacks of 9/11. This is what we're trying to accomplish with -- and their mission with creating the Visitor Education Center. Thank you for the opportunity to speak here.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' I would like to thank Ms. Herr and Mr. Laychak. I want to express my sympathy too for your loss. That's a terrible tragedy. I remember the day and had friends in the D.C. area. Had a person I knew on that flight as well who passed and friends in New York. And it was certainly a day that we'll never forget, and I'm really pleased to see this memorial and education center going forward. So thank you for your work on that. Do Commissioners have any questions for Ms. Herr or Mr. Laychak? (No audible response.)'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Well, hearing none, we're going to open this up for discussion by the Commission. I'd like Commissioners to please turn on your cameras and I'd entertain a motion to approve the comments made for the 9-11 Pentagon Memorial Visitor Education Center.'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Moved by Vice-Chair Hewlett and seconded by Commissioner Dixon. Okay, yes. It's been moved and seconded. And so now we can have discussion. Thank you, and I'm going to begin with again the round robin process. And if you can keep your web cams on during this process, I'd appreciate it. So I'll start with Commissioner McMahon, please.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Good afternoon, Madam Chair. And Mr. Laychak, good afternoon again. We haven't seen you in a while. Such an important addition to the National Capital Region and the area and a continuing memorial. And as Mr. Laychak has said, a continuing way to educate the people in American about what happened that day and its impact, especially at the Pentagon. Lots of, many challenges in terms of both siting and then development of selected sites over the years. I'm glad it's back to this point, and this will be, I think, a fine addition to the Arlington area and our memorials as the Foundation moves forward with this development. Other than that, I've got no comments.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner McMahon. Commissioner Stidham?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': 'Yes, thank you for the presentation, and I look forward to this as it moves forward. Just a couple comments. I think the visitor experience walking from the Visitor Center to the Memorial and vice versa is very important. And it seems just from what was in the EDR and the presentation rather safe. So I hope that when you come back to us, you'll bring some additional investigation into how to better include that experience over -- crossing both ways because I think that is part of either enjoying the visitor center or to experience the Memorial is that walk in between. And it should be contemplated, I think, in thinking about it and less vehicle focused. So I urge you to think about that. I really appreciate moving the building. I think that made a big difference between it was too much on the hillside and too dominant'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': 'on the landscape. And it really should be subservient to the cemetery. So nice job then. I look forward to seeing more. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Stidham. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' I probably -- I don't have any substantial initial comments. I'm really happy to see where we are with this. And moving forward that we are careful to incorporate the comments that we hear especially from those that associate themselves more directly with this memorial. But really happy to see where we are. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Argo. Vice-Chair Hewlett? VICE-'",
        "'CHAIR HEWLETT': 'Yes, first of all, I wanted to say to Mr. Laychak my sincere condolences. I know a lot of time has passed, but it's something you can't ever get over. So please accept my heartfelt condolences. And I want to thank Ms. Herr for her presentation as well. And I just wanted to say this is so very important. I venture to say -- I don't want to be too presumptuous -but I venture to say that most of us participating in this meeting remember and we were knowledgeable. We were riveted to the news. It touched us personally. We lost people. I lost people in New York. And notwithstanding how much we read, how much we heard, when you go to these exhibits, you learn so much more. And you feel it with tremendous depth. So when I went to the visitor's center in New York, I think I'",
        "'CHAIR HEWLETT': 'almost didn't go. I said, well, okay, you know most of what's there is to know. And I was so wrong. I was so wrong. You learn about each individual who perished. I mean, they had something on each individual. You learned so much. And it's important for us to never ever forget. And like someone said earlier, there are people who were not even born yet. They have to know. They have to know so we can stay vigilant and never have this happen again. So I so appreciate this effort. And I too would like to echo the safe connectivity between the Visitor Center and Education Center to the memorial because it just would enhance it that much more. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Vice-Chair Hewlett. Commissioner Green?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'Thank you. I appreciate the -- well, first of all, this is an incredibly important monument. And it's very important to see this through and looking forward to its completion. And I guess my comments are just on the theme of context and reverence. And I think as the monument has developed further, I appreciate the distance that it's traversed to get to where it is. And I would really like to see that sense of reverence continued in the form and materials and building and that contextual connection to the rest of the room so it doesn't feel that it's something separate and apart. And that continues to the walking connection between them, that one could come to this Visitor Center and then walk to the extent possible in a way to absorb what you've just learned and take that with you over to Arlington so that walk is'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'fully a part of that experience. And again, just want to thank you for the adaptations that you've made to the previous comments and look forward very much to seeing the completion of this important monument. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Green. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Well, that was quite a letter from the CFA, and I don't know that I can add to it but maybe put a little more body language on it. The location that the site -- moving the building vastly improved it. But I guess the only place where I part company from the EDR is really this is not a matter of refinement on the building. The context, the massing, the materials, you need to rethink altogether. To me, it seems wildly inappropriate for the site. Even though you've made it smaller and it's sinking into the landscape, it looks like an industrial building. It could be one of those storage unit places. And that's just not dignified enough for the setting or the purpose. And I urge you to not refine but really rethink now that you have a site, especially it occurs to me there's only so much'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'design can do. I don't know how you're going to overcome traversing these major thoroughfares in a way that as Ms. Stidham was describing to create a contemplative journey. And I think in some cases, you're going to find that people just don't bother to go down to the memorial which is not necessarily -- that puts more of an emphasis on the importance of this building and its dignity and sort of -- I mean, I'll leave it to others to talk about what interpretation. I'm sure you have big plans for interpreting the memorial inside this building. But I think it's really important that this be -- well, again, its context. I think the materials need rethinking. And I think the 77 on the roof is just too clever by half. We need to stop being so literal and think that people are going to get that. And'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'then what ends up happening is we -- and I've seen this a million times, we all have, where we get an idea conceptually and then we kind of, like, turn ourselves into a pretzel to make it work. And that's what this feels like. And I'm not sure it's really worth the effort. So I would urge the design team to look at the new site and start again because the building is just not dignified enough. And the connotations of industrial use are inescapable.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you for your comments, Commissioner Wright. Commissioner Cash? I'm sorry. Commissioner Dixon, I apologize.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' It's okay. I want to kind of join Commissioner Wright. She always tells you like it is. I think she's right about this, and I think it's worthy of some consideration by further work on this. I'm also always concerned about energy conservation issues and whether they would be able to be incorporated. That maybe, I don't know, may not fit in. But just always want to do that again. Lastly, I do have a question that I'd like to ask. What about the parking access, driving access, because we had discussions of security measures on the street for cars. Is that going to be a part of the discussion?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' I think we could ask for Ms. Herr to make comment or Mr. Laychak.'",
        "'MS. HERR': ' Well, the building does have -- because it is a Defense building, it does have perimeter security requirements. Some of those details were included in the submission, but more detail will be provided at future submissions. There are some perimeter hardening, things that will be required. We would like obviously those to be designed into the landscape.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' My question goes to the cars that will be coming in. Will they have to be cleared before they enter this area? Or will they just turn into it off the main boulevard there?'",
        "'MS. HERR': ' I don't believe there will be a vehicle screening to park in this parking lot, no.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Okay.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' I do want to say these are important questions, and we will have return visits from our staff and representatives, Mr. Laychak, in the future. So I look forward to as well hearing more. Do you have any other comments, Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' No, thank you very much, Madam Chair.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Sure. You're welcome. Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Oh, thanks so much. First, I do want to associate myself with all the comments about the tragedy. That was a day literally a year before I moved out here. And I just remember being glued to the TV. And my first drive into D.C. was on the one-year anniversary. So I want to associate myself with those comments. I also want to associate myself with Commissioner Wright's comments on the design. But I do also want to throw out what I think would be maybe food for thought as you come back to us. I am concerned about the size of the parking lot for a site like that. I just happened -- because we had the slide in there that showed the visitor centers in Shanksville and in New York. I went back and looked at the Pennsylvania site. They have kind of about the same number of'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'parking places as this does. And that's a place you can only get to by driving. So I think anything you can do to reduce the number of parking spaces might give you a little bit more flexibility when you're going back and looking at the design of the space. And I think that one thing that struck me is as someone that's lived in D.C. for over 20 years, I've never actually made it down to the 9-11 Memorial or to the Air Force Memorial because they are so incredibly inaccessible. And I've heard a lot of comments here about just the pedestrian experience traversing either from the Metro or just from the visitor center to the memorial itself. So maybe as you're looking at this because this is such a tough site with all these roads, maybe it would be great if as part of the ongoing operations'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'there was a shuttle bus that takes you from the Pentagon Metro to the memorial itself to the Visitor Center and actually continues on in partnership with the Navy Memorial just to be able to get out there because they're all kind of in this nice little line. So maybe just other options like that, that can reduce the need for parking. Because there is so much parking around this side, like, even private parking right there in Pentagon City. So if there is some other better way to connect people from parking and transit and to get them moving around these really important memorial sites that are incredibly difficult to traverse right now, I think that that could lessen your need for parking, give you more flexibility on the design, and address a lot of those pedestrian safety issues. I know it's not cheap. But I think that access'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'to these memorials is really important. We do it around internally within Arlington Cemetery. We should look at something here. So just some food for thought and associating myself with those other comments. But I do think that some good progress has been made since the site selection. So I thank you for that.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Commissioner Giachetti, comments on this design or program?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GIACHETTI': ' No substantive comments. Just wanted to say I'd like to echo what my fellow Commissioners have put much more eloquently than I ever could, the importance of this project. And I really appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Giachetti. Mr. Cozart?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Yes, I also want to associate myself with the comments of the Commissioners about both the importance and the impact of this memorial. And thank you for your work on it. And I appreciate the work of Ms. Herr and others on the staff related to this. I do want to encouraging taking very seriously the pushback of Commissioner Wright, the respectful pushback there and also the encouragement of Commissioner Cash around transportation and transit and other ways of getting to the site and Commissioner Stidham as it relates to opportunities to connect safety for pedestrian experience between the education center and the memorial. Understanding that's a significant undertaking but certainly worthwhile given the importance of the education center.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'And thank you, Commissioner Cozart. I too will echo my fellow Commissioners' comments but most importantly just say that this is a uniquely significant project and for all the reasons I think that have been expressed. And it's exciting to see it in front of us. And we look forward to future iterations or additions to the design progress. I would like to specifically echo the thoughts of security options between the two sites, the memorial and the education center. I think that's always important. But also having worked at a national museum myself, every trail, every pathway is an opportunity to tell a story. So I also agree with the comments that there's an opportunity --an incredible opportunity to connect the two through an experiential design on that path. I also want to say access is critically important and agree with those who tried to achieve connection with some'",

The University of the District of Columbia has submitted a 2020 update to its campus plan for review by NCPC under a 1972 jurisdictional transfer agreement which grants our Commission approval authority over all UDC campus plan updates. The UDC submission is in for draft review. And our comments focus on development sustainability, landscaping and transportation and travel demand management as reflected in the UDC plan. UDC was officially formed in 1975 when Congress authorized the consolidation of three schools, the District of Columbia Teachers College, Federal City College, the Washington Technical Institute. However, the schools' roots extend back to the Miner Normal School for African American Girls founded by Myrtilla Miner in 1851 and the Washington Normal School for White Girls which was founded in 1873.

WEIL': '1968 was the predecessor school that occupied the buildings on the current UDC campus after being vacated by the National Bureau of Standards which moved out to Gaithersburg, Maryland, and is now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. Prior to the current 2020 update, our Commission approved the previous UDC plan in December 2011 which focused on improving student life and improving the university's sustainability goals and objectives. Leading up to our current review, UDC updated its campus plan in 2020 undergoing its required review and approval by the District's Zoning Commission in 2021. And as part of that update process, UDC representatives held several meetings with the local ANC. And the university also initiated a UDC community task force which is scheduled to meet quarterly to discuss issues such as campus planning, student conduct, traffic and parking, construction activity, and any other topics that'",

More recently, the Zoning Commission is reviewing a modification to the campus plan that reflects the potential location of a new consolidated District Archives building on the UDC campus which I will present to our Commission immediately following this presentation. The UDC's Van Ness Campus is situated in northwest Washington, D.C., encompassing approximately 21 acres and 11 university-related buildings which are designed in the new Brutalist style of architecture. The UDC campus is bounded by Yuma Street to the north, Connecticut Avenue to the east, Van Ness Street to the south, and the International Court and part of the International Chancery Complex to the west.

With our approval role, NCPC has formal review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. And we have initiated our formal 106 review process with the District's State Historic Preservation Office. And we will complete our formal NEPA and 106 review requirements prior to the final campus plan submission. For individual site and building projects on the UDC campus, however, NCPC has advisory review authority as with all District projects located outside of the downtown central area. And we articulate these points through our final Executive Director's Recommendation.

To the east of the core area located at the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Van Ness Street and adjacent to the Van Ness UDC Metrorail Station is the UDC Student Center which our Commission approved in 2011. The recognizable building gives UDC a visible presence along the Connecticut Avenue corridor and serves as a symbol of sustainability based on its LEED Platinum design.

Three buildings, number 52, 4250, and 4225, are university related but are not located on campus property. That was part of the 1972 transfer. Building 52 houses the UDC David A. Clark School of Law. And UDC recently purchased Building 4250 and will use this space to help meet future university administrative and academic needs.

And to the east across Connecticut Avenue are medium density commercial buildings and high density residential apartment buildings. Regarding transit accessibility, UDC has the benefit of its adjacent location next to Metrorail. And there are multiple Metro bus routes that operate along Connecticut Avenue, Van Ness Street, and Yuma Street, giving the location a variety of travel options. A look at UDC's existing mode shares, both for students and staff, reflects the locations' relatively good transit accessibility. And we note this as part of our Executive Director's Recommendation.

The 2020 plan calls for establishing the UDC campus as a landmark and important economic engine for the city and region alike. The plan cites multiple sustainability, space optimization, infrastructure improvement, and student life focused objectives which are meant to guide future campus development. And based on these objectives, UDC proposes a variety of projects over the next ten years between 2020 and 2029 which are shown here in this graphic that is taken directly from the UDC plan update. In total, the plan includes 160,000 square feet of potential new building construction of which 120,000 square feet represents future on campus student housing which is an institutional priority. In the remaining space, 40,000 square feet would consistent of potential vertical additions to existing campus buildings.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'And I will now walk you through some of the more notable projects over the next few slides. Starting with student housing, we can see two potential sites in the plan, Site A on the north which would consist of a new four-story dorm constructed over the UDC outdoor tennis complex. And a second option would be to convert Building 44 into a new dormitory space. UDC would like to decommission its central power plant which is shown here as Building 43 and repurpose the building into new academic or administrative space along with a potential additional level added to the building. Another option would be to refurbish buildings 32 and 42 which are conjoined into new academic and/or administrative space. And this project would also add an additional level to the building.

And I will review the current proposal for this site as a new archive building immediately following this presentation. And our final Executive Director's Recommendation, we do note the current UDC plan describes multiple potential development options for Building 41 including its repurposing as new student housing or academic space.

And sustainability is a core value of the 2020 plan with projects that include stormwater management improvements such as reducing hardscape area, increasing pervious paving and narrowing the sidewalks, energy efficiency improvements with better building performance monitoring, designing all new construction and substantial renovations to meet a LEED Silver standard, and future phase-out of the university's central heating plan. The 2020 plan includes 70,000 square feet of new green roof installations across five buildings and six rooftop solar arrays as depicted here in this campus plan update graphic.

And this expansion would be done as part of the UDC's plan to develop a new southwest athletic field. And this expanded capacity would help reduce the need for the university's power plant and allow for its eventual redevelopment. The university has a goal to increase the tree canopy area on its campus to meet the city's 40 percent canopy area goal along with other initiatives set forth through the District's Sustainability 2.0 plan.

And we summarize these future projects in the final Executive Director's Recommendation. In addition, we encourage the university to commit to a higher LEED goal, either Gold or Platinum, for all new construction and major renovations to help UDC achieve its sustainability objectives. The 2020 plan shows a number of strategies to improve the look, feel, and character of the campus with new vegetative screen building systems and other contemporary building treatments.

And we express Commission support for these strategies to enhance the image of UDC, to enhance student life and learning, and to contribute to the local surrounding community in our final Executive Director's Recommendation. Finally, the university plan includes a number of streetscape and campus improvements to help create a more pedestrian and bicycle friendly experience along the campus frontages, including eliminating vehicular driveways, providing additional landscaping, and working with DDOT to make safety improvements to adjacent intersections.

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes, Commissioner Dixon.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' First of all, I appreciate the presentation. I have a historical connection with this school, so I'm very excited. One thing I wonder, though, I'm always questioning and not sure someone could answer here. But what's the comparison of green versus sustainable solar paneling. I know the mix is valuable. But I'm wondering what the different payoff, different comparisons would be. Can anyone answer that? And rather than have a green roof, if you had more solar paneling, that kind of approach?'",
        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' So I'm going to give it a stab, and thank you for the question. Since these buildings are built in the '70s, not all roofs are structurally adequate to support the weight of green roofs. So as we analyze the weight of these options, we need to balance as well either we do one or we go with the other. So our approach at this point is we're focusing on solar panels to the newer groups. And we are approaching the new options, the new buildings in general as potential opportunities for green roofs.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I think the green roofs are great, but you say they require more --the roofs have to accommodate the weight of them whereas solar doesn't maybe carry that weight restriction and may be easier. So it seems to me that maybe leaning towards the solar paneling. Is that not correct?'",
        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' For existing buildings, that's correct.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Okay. And future buildings could be designed to accommodate sustainable energy?'",
        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' Yes, that would be part of the program to analyze for future buildings.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Thank you. Also, there has been on occasion that you all have focused on environment the connection between the university and the Anacostia River. And at some point some discussion of having a presence near that river to allow greater attention to the environmental river cleanup, that type of thing. Would that be something that would be either a future consideration? If not, one in the plan that would jump a distance. I mean, it would go from where you are now on Connecticut Avenue or Anacostia River east. Would that be appropriate here, or is it just a little out of reach at the moment?'",
        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' I don't have enough information on that level of institutional decisions to properly answer that question in this setting at this moment. (Simultaneous speaking.)'",
        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' We do work very closely with -- of course, with the Department of Energy and with Pepco and others. But I'm going to leave it there for this session if that's okay.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'We have a major project developing in our Anacostia River East. And this may be a time to consider some part of UDC there particularly when the rivers all over the country, in the world, are getting lots of attention and how you clean them. And we're working very hard with the only river that belongs to a community, our city, Anacostia River. So it'll be good. I know that at one point one of our mayors suggested this, that UDC have a presence there, maybe move there, but have a presence there. So I think it's something you need to think about. I also have some concerns about the -- well, the -- some of the parking issues that you have and traffic issues in terms of accessing the parking lot and that type of thing. That's being looked at in a traffic flow and to help with that'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'problem. Is that being looked at or has been looked at?'",
        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' Yes, in terms of the parking and transportation, I don't know if anyone else in the group wants to address those. But those are key components, especially for the new DC Archives building that we're proposing here to be looked at, of course. (Simultaneous speaking.)'",
        "'MS. MOLDENHAUER': ' Thank you, Mr. Dussan. I can supplement that as well. As part of our campus master plan, the master plan group included a traffic consultant and he worked extensively with DDOT to identify transportation management plans which would decrease the reliance on vehicular uses and encourage additional multi-modal transportation uses. Thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' The last question I have deals with the Archives building. We have a number of historical archiving going on now at the Martin Luther King Library and D.C. has another archive. So I'm very excited about the idea that it would be at the university where it could be both kept and be studied by students. So is there any coordination with these other D.C. archiving efforts?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Commissioner Dixon, if I could just interject here for a moment. I think that's a very important question. But I think the archive is another agenda item. So maybe we could --(Simultaneous speaking.)'",

        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' So that site is not part of the UDC campus.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I know. I'm just asking what's the neighboring use.'",

And especially including the history as well because as Commissioner Dixon indicated, the history is so important. And the Miner Normal School is just one facet of it. But that's just really important, telling our story. And I personally had family members who attended the Miner Normal School. And it just touches my heart that you went, took the initiative to go through the whole history and tell the story because our stories need to be told. So thank you so very much.

And I think especially so given the disappointing Supreme Court ruling recently that puts so much more emphasis on what our land grant universities need to do for us. And I think it's just so terrific that UDC is really bolstering itself and bolstering its facilities because that, to me, the most important part of education is the ability to uplift and to grow. And it's so exciting to see this. And I just think it's a burden that's being placed -- pushed back onto land grant schools. And it's exciting to see UDC moving forward with that with enthusiasm.

        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Okay. So in fairness to the previous applicant, I have to say LEED Silver is not aspirational enough. But having said that, I think the plan is a good one. You've got to kind of herd some cats and dogs here and unify this campus that wasn't all built at the same time. And I know that's difficult. I think it's the student center. Is that the new one that's on Connecticut and --'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' Van Ness, yes.'",

And you're making all the right moves and saying all the right stuff about trees and greening up the campus. It will also -- I think if it's done well by a really good landscape architect, the landscape could be a really powerful unifying factor in knitting the campus together. So you could be killing two birds with one stone. I would urge that you try for at least LEED Gold. I know it's hard to do and it's something expensive. But you want to inspire the students who attend the university to do their best. And so I would urge that you would look towards getting the Gold. But otherwise, I think it's a really solid plan.

But I want to make -- the Dennard Plaza is a pretty harsh place in the sun. So with the new furniture that you all recommended, maybe you can create some shady -- some kind of shade issues that would help out. I think it would be hard to grow trees on it because it's, I think, almost all concrete underneath. But that would be an area that could be softer and use that as shade. Lastly, I will not let go of the idea of thinking long range if not short that we have a presence in our Anacostia River East. And particularly when we got these plans coming out with that land to be used now, I just think it would be very spectacular. They have it on that side'",

I think UDC deserves a lot of credit over the last ten years since the last master plan and being more creative and looking at, like, the acquisition of 4250 and some of these buildings that aren't necessarily on the campus and working very closely with the community on making sure that everyone from the university to the neighbors are working very closely together.

But this is D.C.'s only -- this is our public university here that is a four-year public university. It's open to all D.C. kids. They don't charge the exorbitant amount of tuition these other places do. And even all these buildings that have been acquired have been done through the city. New York City is carrying the debt because the university just can't. So I think they've done a great job with the small resources they have. Every year, the Council tries to tuck a little bit more money in there to do things like the 4250 acquisition.

The District Department of General Services or DGS has submitted plans for a new D.C. Archives and Records building. And as a District project outside of the downtown central area, we have an advisory review authority over the project. The applicants submitted the project for preliminary design review. However, staff is recommending a series of concept level comments based on the draft review stage of the UDC campus plan and the need to revise the UDC plan to accurately reflect the new archive building proposals as discussed in my previous presentation. As such, our proposed comments related to design sustainability, landscaping, lighting, security. And finally, we request some additional information as part of the next project submission from the applicant. And I will go through each of these'",

This site is currently occupied by UDC's Building 41 which is known as the College of Arts and Sciences building. The building is only partially occupied right now with a childcare facility. And the building also houses the UDC Felix E. Grant Jazz Archives Collection. The 158,000 square foot, six-level brutalist style building has a massive look. It was completed in 1979. The building is prominent in the area based on its 90-foot height and octagonal shape which is distinctive from the other rectilinear buildings on the UDC campus.

And we note this in the Executive Director's Recommendation. As described in my earlier presentation, the 2020 UDC Campus Plan shows multiple potential uses for the project site which include preserving and repurposing Building 41 for future student housing or new academic space or adding on to Building 41 and using the building as a new consolidated District archive facility.

This graphic compares the two building footprints and their locations on the site with the archives building encompassing a ground area of approximately 30,000 square feet compared to Building 41's 26,000 square foot ground area. And the new building would roughly align with Building 41's west and north sides. However, a portion of the building's east facade would pull back from Dennard Plaza.

A new building would be located on the UDC campus but would not be managed by UDC. Rather, the city would operate, manage, and control the new facility through its Office of Public Records which is part of the Mayor's Office. The new building's design would reflect a combination of Brutalist design elements which is the predominant style on the UDC campus along with more modern elements of UDC's student union center. And here you can see the building's mix of block here, more massive looking elements as well as glassy, undulating, curvilinear parts.

And the delivery, receiving, and loading access would be accessed from a service road off of Van Ness Street. The building's second, third, and fourth levels would be primarily allocated to archival staff work areas shown here as the brown shaded rooms with storage areas shown in light and dark green. The penthouse level plan on the right shows solar PV arrays and a partial rooftop. And we note this in the Executive Director's Recommendation. The design goal for the project is to meet the LEED Gold standard.'",
        "'MR. WEIL': 'However, we do encourage the applicant, DDGS, to consider a LEED Platinum design standard for the project given the urgency of climate change and in light of the District's larger sustainability goals. The building design is driven by the city's need for a consolidated archival storage and records facility which has unique functional considerations that include accommodating 18-foot floor to floor height, storage shelving systems, preventing all natural light from intruding into storage spaces which requires significant portions of the building facade to be designed without fenestration. And the new building must balance a mix of public access and security with limited access storage, research, and work areas on Levels 2 through 4 and a public research center, the UDC Felix E. Grant Jazz Archives Research Center, a 300-person multi-purpose room, public exhibit spaces, and a building lobby on the ground level. And we reference these requirements as part of'",

And here are the north and west facing sides of the building where the building more expansive blank walls would be more apparent. The building sides would face UDC's athletic fields and the International Chancery Center located further to the west.

The project would require the removal of 31 trees, many of which are described as undersized and in poor health by the applicant. And based on a comment from DDOT's Urban Forestry division, we remind the applicant that any planned larger tree removals or trees with 14-inch trunk diameters or larger would require a special tree removal permit from the Forestry division.

Although the project would slightly increase the number of trees on the site, we encourage the applicant to work with UDC to identify additional tree planting locations around the campus near the project site which would not only benefit the new building but additional trees would also help the university attain its 40 percent tree canopy area goal. In particular, we encourage the applicant to consider planting additional trees along the west side of the building's access drive which would also benefit the future UDC athletic field there near Dennard Plaza and directly north of the project site where feasible.

Archives Advisory Group and local ANC.

        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' So I had just a couple questions. The master plan says that there are multiple potential future uses for Building 41. And I think it included the College of Arts and Sciences and a library, student housing and new academic space. Is there somewhere in the campus plan where those uses are redirected to a different structure? Or how will those uses be addressed for the campus?'",
        "'MR. WEIL': ' Well, right now, the building is only partially occupied. I believe there's a daycare facility there now, and it also houses the jazz archives collection. Those uses, I believe, would be relocated to another building on campus. But I'll let Mr. Dussan provide more information on that.'",
        "'MR. DUSSAN': ' Yes, that is correct. We're currently renovating Buildings 38 and 39 to relocate some of the uses. And also we plan on renovating 4250 to relocate and consolidate colleges in that building. So very few uses right now for the building community. The childcare is in an isolated part of the building. And they would be there until the end of this year.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' Okay. I understand that the archives will be a public building not associated with the campus. And the other locations were investigated before choosing this one. Can you help me understand why you would use the campus space that could have a future function for the campus or a public space that is not associated with the campus?'",
        "'MS. MOLDENHAUER': ' Sure. Commissioner Stidham, this is Meridith Moldenhauer. The university always understood there was an opportunity for both its needs to serve the student's needs and the city's needs as well as serving the District's needs from the District Archives. So in preparing the master campus plan, we evaluated multiple different uses for each building, understanding that we could accomplish both goals here. And so we think that the ability to serve this will also serve the university students, will serve the community overall.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' Okay. Thank you. My concern is this -- we've talked about this significance of the campus when we were talking about the master plan. And this being the only one in the United States anymore, just concerns with occupying campus space, that maybe you don't have a defined purpose for it right now. But future use of students and then giving up that space for a program that has opportunity in other locations. Just thinking not about uses today or 20 years from now but 50 years from now when the campus needs to expand to meet the needs of the students and how that would accommodate it with an adjacent building. So that was the point for my question. So thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Chair Goodmann, I was wondering if it would be appropriate if I weighed in with just a little bit of a policy history behind here because the Council is the one that kind of made these moves and maybe provide a little bit more context there.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' I'm certainly open to that, Commissioner Cash. Thank you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'So this is depending on how you count it in the last ten years, this is the third or fourth site that we've tried to make this work at. So the original plan was looking at the Recorder of Deeds building down here at Judiciary Square. And that simply wasn't feasible because of the historic nature of the structure and just the size of it. There's a facility called Penn Center in Eckington which is along the train tracks there. That facility was seriously considered for a while. But again, it's historic. There were considerations about space constraints and just about being so close to an industrial area. We had looked at maybe doing it on W Street over by Home Depot for a while. But there were better uses that were found for that. We just don't have a lot of land. So I think in working with the'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'university, there's a lot of synergy that can happen here by having D.C.'s facility on the university site. We can have partnerships to have internships come over and help us sort all this information which we haven't had. We just saw a lot of really good synergies by having this kind of archive programming happening in the city right adjacent to our public education institution. And just going back to what I mentioned earlier, about we've had such great partnerships with the university, with us helping them get other buildings. And they were, I think, able to make this work in their overall plans too. But it's been a journey of finding this location.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' Thank you, Commissioner. That is helpful and it does make a lot of sense. As someone who's done a lot of research in the city, moving from spot to spot to spot to get something from here to find out you need to go somewhere else to get the other piece of what you're looking for, it will be very nice to have it in one nice space. It's just trying to understand the thinking behind the process. So thank you for that.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Stidham and Commissioner Cash. Are there more questions from Commissioners for Mr. Weil or the team assembled?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, I have a quick question.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' There seems to be a constituency for every Brutalist building in this city and elsewhere. Is there one for this one? Because, boy, is it a dog. I hope not.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' I don't hear any comments from our guests on that.'",
        "'MS. MOLDENHAUER': ' We are not aware of any constituency.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Okay, good. So you're not going to get anybody showing up at the last minute saying, don't tear it down? Okay.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I will speak up as a constituent for the building. (Laughter.)'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I think it's a great idea. And I want to make a motion to adopt it when I get a chance.'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Well, hearing no further questions for staff and representatives of the project, I would entertain a motion. So if you can turn your cameras on, Commissioners, please, and make yourselves available. But I'd entertain a motion then to approve the comments on the concept plans for the District of Columbia Archives Building so that we can have a discussion -- a full discussion amongst ourselves. Is there --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' So moved.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Madam Chair, I said I would make a motion already.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. We have many motions and seconds. Ms. Koster, I'll leave that to you. It's been moved and second, though I do want to start the round robin process. And we're starting with Commissioner Cash this time if you have any additional comments on this project.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'I actually do. I think in the last or one of the last presentations, we talked a little bit about the historic context. And I've worked on this archives project for Council. We're going over ten years now. So I've been really in the deep working closely with the archives advisory group. And just for context, the current Archives building that we have in the District is in Naylor Court. It's a 25,000 square foot building that was built in 1880. It has HVAC that -- we probably have better HVAC system in the offices we're all sitting in now that this old building has. And it is structurally -- this has needed to happen for a long time. This discussion has been going on for 20 years. I mean, while I think any state's archives are really important to the state, I think D.C., being the nation's capital, we're'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'fairly unique. So the current archives right now, that horrible building in Naylor Court, has all of our land records going back to 1790. And all of the things that went along with those records uniquely in D.C. like manumission papers and all that is included here. We have Frederick Douglass' will - it is in this building. George Washington's will is sitting in this building in an alleyway in Shaw in an 1880s building. So I mean, the amount of stuff in here that needs to be preserved is really important. It hasn't even been sorted in probably 100 years. We don't know where to find the stuff in the current building because it's just so inadequate. So that's why this project has been going on for so long to get it in a state of the art modern facility that we can all be proud of. And a'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'lot of the stuff that's in there, Commissioner Stidham mentioned trying to go and do the research because, like, we only have, like, three or four people. So you have to make an appointment a week in advance to go and see these old land records. So just the public accessibility being able to go in there and see all this stuff is so important. They can't do it right now. And there's other, like, interesting artifacts that are in there too. So I don't know if anyone has ever been in the courthouse in Los Angeles. There's a sculpture of young Abraham Lincoln that's in there. The original cast of that is in the D.C. archives right now. Like, there's an old electric chair from D.C. jail in the early 1900s. Like, there's so much history that just can't be displayed to the public right now. So that's why'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'this project, I think, is really, really important. And looking at this building is not just like another building on a university campus. But it's the first time in the District's 250 years that we'll finally have all this stuff together viewable to the public, viewable to the next generation. They can come in and see it. So I don't want to go off on too much of a tangent. But I've just been involved in this project for so long, I just want to give context to what we're really talking about compared to what we think about state archives in other states. So being the nation's capital, we have something that's pretty unique and it's our local history too. So I just want to -- I will also just comment on the design because I've seen the designs from those other locations I mentioned. No offense to the'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'architecture firm because I know it's the same firm, but I think this site has given you a lot more freedom to do something that's a lot better than what we saw with trying to squeeze the program into those other locations. And I know that there were a lot of comments about trying to get the LEED rating on this up. I will say that because of the whole campus right now is so Brutalist, I think that these initial designs do an interesting job of trying to marry the two so that we don't have some -- and the student center really sticks out. It's still a beautiful building. But I think this is doing an interesting job of blending. And I think that might have something to do with the LEED rating. But it's so much better from where we've been over the last several iterations on'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'other sites. So I want to give congratulations to the architecture team and the team at DGS for moving ahead this long. Please don't value engineer this because there's so many DGS projects that have been value engineered over the past years as the price of materials has gone up. So I really encourage you to -- this is a great first step, and I can't wait to see the final plans going down the line. So that's my long speech. So thanks for listening.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Appreciate your passion for this project and the background and history of the archive. It's fascinating and just makes this work all the more important. So moving along, Commissioner Giachetti -- I'm sorry, Giachetti?'",

        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Thank you for the presentation, and thank you to the staff. When the presentation was being shared, I was excited about the opportunities for more programming and all kinds of things that could really support a focus on archives, really channeling Commissioner Cash's passion there. And I think that's really something remarkable. And I'm excited to see where this goes.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thanks. Appreciate the presentation from the staff and the vibrant discussion. I appreciate especially Commissioner Wright's discussion about Brutalism in the District of Columbia. But good use of the property. It's just we didn't really say it. I think Commissioner Cash kind of reflected on it. But I mean, there is synergy there between D.C.'s archives and the university's mission of preserving the history of D.C. So I think there's great value there to give them the space to do what they need to do to really get a good handle on the records and reflecting what's happened for so many years. Thank you.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' I definitely agree with everything that's been said. I mean, the District is such a special place and such a unique history and the fact that the records have been stored in that location under situations that are not optimal and not accessible for everyone to learn. It is sad and looking forward to this new building and its uses and access to all the students.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Yes, I really appreciate the work that's been done on this. And I think going back to one of the earlier comments, I think it's more difficult than many of us may realize, how hard it is to balance public access with the security needs in buildings like this and to do that in a way where design and functionality are not compromised. So I would say good job. And let's move ahead. I appreciate it. Thank you.'",

        "'CHAIR HEWLETT': ' Yes, I would like to associate myself with several of the previous comments. Thank you. And again, I'd like to thank Mr. Weil for his presentation. And also to Commissioner Cash, thank you for your historical perspective, for sharing that. That really shed a lot of light on it too. Thank you so much.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Vice-Chair Hewlett. Commissioner Green?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Thank you. I really like this project. I love the co-location of the Archives on UDC campus. I think that's just going to be a terrific long-term affiliation. And I really like the design of the building. There are very few places in the world where you see contextual brutalist infill. And it looks a lot easier to do than it is, and it's done very well. I think it's a very good building. I think it suits its site. It suits its function. It's very understated for what it is. It's a trickier piece of infill than it looks and just really looking forward to seeing this.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Great. Thank you so much, Commissioner Green. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'I think you had a -- this is a real opportunity to get rid of that clunker. I think I insulted dogs earlier. That's a bad building by anyone's standard. But I do have a couple of suggestions. I think the massing is really quite elegant. But I have a couple of suggestions, and they have to do with context. I agree with Commissioner Green. This is not easy to pull off. And I think you're really close, but why not try for even closer. Two things, I think -- well, three things. Okay. One, you're in danger of having the many faces of Eve, a schizophrenic building. It could be the rendering, and I get why the north and west are practically windowless for the function of the building. And again, it might be a rendering thing. But it kind of looked like the two other elevations, like, west'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'and north and then south and east could be different buildings. And again, it's just that the renderings make it look so dark. So that's probably something you've already thought of. And not like I'm going to tell you anything you haven't thought of. The other thing I would suggest is a little bit -- a punch of more color. And I'm specifically thinking about the student union building. It is quite vibrant and the values of the hues that have been employed there are very deep. And again, rendering. I can see that you've got some punches of color inside that you can see through the glazed elevations. But you might think about adding a little bit more because it'll signal that it's part of the composition on Van Ness Street. And the other thing that you might think about although I know people hate them is somehow figuring'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'out some ways to include some glass bricks. And I saw that because of Intelsat. You never know. UDC may come up with a bunch of dough one day and acquire it, although I'm sure it looks unlikely because it's just been bought. But might as well take the long view. And even if it doesn't, there's nothing wrong with looking like you're having something in common with your neighbors even if the property line doesn't extend to Intelsat. You're still on the same street. And so it's just a thought. That's less compelling to me than trying to integrate something of the student union building into these archives. That's it.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Wright. And finally then, Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I support it, and thank you for all the comments everybody gave.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. And I do have a few comments. Finally, I just want to say thank you again to Mr. Weil for the presentation and for all the support, professional support staff that have been here to answer our questions. It's very important to us. I especially want to thank Commissioner Cash for that history because having worked for the State of Iowa Historical Society as a trustee and for our own local county in Dubuque, Iowa, I know how critically important archives are. But I am just so jazzed by this marriage of archives with the small university setting because there is a population drop for incoming students in 2025 into colleges and universities across the country. And I think it's these kinds of really important and special partnerships that are going to be an attraction to new students as the university tries to reinvigorate its student'",

I think you'll find this is going to be critically important to the kids coming in. And I agree with Mina. I'm not a fan of Brutalist. I love the new building. I love the -- as the point made by Commissioner Green, the infill has been done very well given the challenges. And this is just a very creative and exciting project. So congratulations. I look forward to seeing the next submission. Are there any more comments? Are there further comments from the Commissioners? Anything else? Well, hearing none, then Ms. Koster, could you please confirm the motion and the second and take the roll call vote, please.'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Motion clearly passes. Thank you very much, Ms. Koster. Agenda Item 6D is to approve the final master plan for the FDA's Muirkirk Campus. And Ms. Free is going to be making this presentation. I do want to say that there are representatives from several different organizations, Elena Garrison and Timothy Garman from the FDA, Rod Henderer from CRTKL, and Shelly Jones from GSA. So thank you, Ms. Free. If you could begin. And turn off cameras.'",
        "'MS. FREE': ' Great, thank you. Can you see me, hear me, and see my screen?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes.'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'Thank you. Good afternoon, Commissioners. The U.S. General Services Administration in coordination with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has submitted a final master plan for the FDA Muirkirk Campus or MRC which is located in Laurel, Maryland. The purpose of the proposed master plan is to guide the future development of the campus over the next 20 years as a leading scientific institution and a campus that is exemplary in environmental stewardship. And overall, staff is recommending approval of the final master plan. The Commission reviewed the most recent master plan for the MRC in 1981. Prior to that, the campus site development plan was reviewed by the Commission in 1966. The Commission heard an information presentation about the master plan update in February 2021 and approved comments on the draft master plan in September of 2021. Today, we are looking at the final review for the MRC's new'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'master plan. At the final review stage, the Commission should be focused on topics such as any unresolved issues or comments on the draft master plan and completion of the transportation management plan. I'll begin the presentation with some brief context for the MRC. And then I'll discuss the framework of the 2021 draft master plan and the Commission's comments on the draft. I'll then provide an overview of the preferred alternative that was selected for the final master plan and the refinements to the plan since the draft. The FDA MRC is a 249-acre campus located approximately 16 miles northeast of central Washington, D.C. The campus is centrally located between Route 1 to the west and Interstate 295 to the east. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 The campus is near several other'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'federal properties in Prince George's County, including the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. And that's the Goddard Space Flight Center and the proposed Bureau of Engraving and Printing site. The campus is also located approximately one and a half miles east of the Muirkirk Station and about six and a half miles north of the Greenbelt Metro Station. Other FDA campuses in the region are also nearby, including the FDA White Oak Campus in Silver Spring and the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition in College Park. The campus' primary access is from Muirkirk Road and it's bisected by Odell Road, dividing the property into an east parcel and a west parcel. The master plan focuses development on the west parcel only around two existing buildings referred to as modules or Mods 1 and 2 and the Beltsville Research Facility, or the BRF, to the east. The draft master'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'plan anticipated consolidation of 1,500 additional employees to bring the total site population to 1,800. A total of 438,000 gross square feet of development and 900 parking spaces were proposed to accommodate this expansion. The draft master plan proposed three different alternatives, A, B, and C. The Commission did not state a preference for this specific development alternative in the draft review. Instead, the Commission notes pros and cons of each alternative and provided comments for the applicant to incorporate in the development of a preferred alternative. FDA has selected Alternative B as a preferred alternative in the final master plan. Staff supports Alternative B as the preferred alternative because it balances program needs with the site's unique natural resources and character. Alternative B proposes a new central office building that connects Mods 1 and 2 to another new office building on the east side of the site with a'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'parking garage located behind Module 1 and a new entrance on Odell Road. Two secure access points are now proposed, both on Muirkirk Road and Odell Road. Here you can see the proposed interconnected office buildings four and five stories high in the draft master plan. An office building with a glass atrium was also proposed as a terminus to the view from Muirkirk Road. The Commission supported the orientation of the buildings on the central natural landscape space in Alternative B. However, it found that the long sequence of buildings created a hardened edge that conflicted with the site's unique natural character. The Commission also found that the distribution of the proposed parking near Mods 1 and 2 and the BRF better supported the campus population as compared with the other alternatives which consolidated the parking to one side of the site. Additional comments provided by the Commission included'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'retaining a formal entrance into the campus from Muirkirk Road, maximizing an uninterrupted view from the main entrance into the natural landscape, refining the program needs, providing all employee parking and structured garages rather than surface lots, and avoiding permanent impacts to wetlands and streams to the extent possible. So I'll now discuss how alternative B has evolved in the final master plan. This segment of the presentation will also discuss project phasing and improvements to the transportation management plan. The final master plan anticipates approximately 385,000 square feet of office, laboratory, and shared use space, a total campus population of 1,800 employees, 900 employee parking spaces, and support facilities such as a visitor center and transit center, security screening stations, and open space amenities. Staff notes that Alternative B incorporates adjustments to population estimates and additional lab space that were not part of the 2021 draft master plan. However,'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'the total anticipated employee population is still the same and the total square footage of development does not exceed the draft master plan estimates. The development program has also been refined through a series of iterations studying the building siting, massing, and conceptual design that were driven by two main factors. First, FDA recently completed a two- phase laboratory study that confirmed the appropriate size of laboratory space for the campus. And secondly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently updated its 21st century workspace planning policy which is based on increased telework. By applying this policy, approximately 1,200 seats are needed to support the 1,800 person population at the MRC. Here we have a bird's eye view of Alternative B which demonstrates how new development has spread across the campus with the proposed laboratory at the center and connects to existing Building Module 1 and 2 and'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'the new office building to the east. Two structured parking garages distribute employee parking on either side of the campus. And a visitor parking lot is provided just outside of the secure perimeter co-located with a transit center that support ridesharing and bus service near the main entrance on Muirkirk Road and to the east off of Odell Road as a new secure access point for truck screening. And here is the view of Alternative B from the draft master plan for comparison. You can see that the final plan is generally consistent with some refinements to the building size or massing. I will discuss the development phasing plan. The first space will relocate some of the existing campus employees to a new office annex space located here adjacent to existing Module Building 2. This building will replace an existing 35-space surface parking lot which is the first step in'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'reducing the campus' parking ratio. And it's anticipated that this phase will be completed by 2025. The second phase represents the first phase of growth and is anticipated to occur around 2030 with a consolidation of 168 additional employees, bringing the total site population to approximately 468 people. New construction includes two four-level laboratory buildings, a two-level parking structure with 235 spaces adjacent to Module 1 and an adjacent maintenance and storage building. Realignment of the campus' main entrance, a new guard booth, and the visitor transit center, shared drop off and truck screening facility near Odell Road are also included in phase 2. An intermediary phase will occur during the construction of phase 2. The existing support buildings and existing fitness center and a new temporary parking lot with 235 spaces at the BRF site will be maintained. The temporary lot will be demolished when phase 2 construction is'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'complete and the garage behind Module 1 is constructed. The timing of the third phase is not yet known. But it is assumed that a gradual increase of an additional 1,332 employees will occur within a 20 to 30-year time frame with a horizon of 2040. It includes construction of two five-level office buildings and shared use space. This space also includes a four-level parking structure with 665 spaces near Odell Road. And here we have the view into the campus from the main entrance on Muirkirk Road. The Commission previously requested that the applicant study how to maximize the view into the natural landscape from this entrance. And to do so, the final master plan proposes a physical break between the upper floors of the laboratory buildings. Additional views around the campus demonstrate the building massing and form which will be refined further in the design phase. The Commission'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'will have an opportunity to review the designs as part of the future site and building plan submissions. And here you can see that the buildings will be mostly screened by an existing 100-foot vegetative buffer that will be maintained along Muirkirk Road. This is a view from above looking east to west. The locations for the new buildings have been chosen because they're in relatively flat parts of the site and brace the site's woodlands and make the woodlands accessible for staff as an amenity space. And here looking west to east with Modules 1 and 2 in the foreground, breaks in the building massing are provided between the new office and laboratory buildings that create a more porous edge. And overall, staff finds that the building massing in Alterative B has improved by incorporating physical breaks that respond to the site's natural features while maintaining circulation between the'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'buildings. In addition, Alternative B has eliminated all wetland impacts and reduced the amount of impervious surface area that was previously proposed. As seen in the proposed landscape plan here, an elevated boardwalk between the buildings weaves through the central natural space, avoiding impacts to wetlands and water resources. Tree cover is also a priority. About five acres of trees will be removed and replaced in accordance with NCPC's policies. Here we have a view of the designed landscape spaces around the new buildings and roads with the new tree cover turned off for clarity. The tree cover we see here is what will be preserved on the site and also forest improvement areas. The final master plan also incorporates a number of sustainable site and building features, including solar panels on top of the building and garage rooftops and a solar canopy over the visitor's surface parking lot. On'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'the building, solar will be installed in combination with extensive green roof vegetation. The master plan also incorporates other green building elements such as using low carbon emitting materials and green walls. And the landscape design will incorporate native vegetation, permeable paving, bioswales, rain gardens, and other low impact stormwater management techniques. Electrical vehicle charging stations are also considered in the parking areas. And overall, staff commends the final master plan's approach to green building for future development which includes a minimum of LEED Gold certification, sustainable site Silver certification, net zero energy and water, WELL certification, extensive solar array and green roof installations, and decarbonization goals consistent with federal standards. The desired image of the MRC assimilates a look and feel that ties the campus to other FDA properties in the region with material such as terracotta, warm brick tones, and mass timber. And as a civilian federal facility,'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'the MRC must adhere to the latest standard of the interagency security committee Level 3 requirements. The campus is currently surrounded by a ten-foot high chain link fence with barbed wire on top. The interior fences are currently seven feet high. Per ISC requirements, any new development on the campus should maintain a 50- meter site setback from the perimeter. And the campus plan incorporates elements necessary to restrict the uncontrolled access of vehicles and pedestrians. With this in mind, the plan seeks to integrate security design with the use of the natural topography, new landscape elements, outdoor spaces, and stormwater DMPs. Ornamental fencing similar to the example shown here is planned in areas of pedestrians and high public visibility. And a chain link fence will be provided in the more hidden or wooded areas on the campus. The final master plan includes an updated transportation management plan or TMP.'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'In the next few slides, I will discuss the Commission's comments on the draft TMP and how the final TMP has been updated to address those comments. The TMP indicates that most FDA employees travel approximately 11 to 20 miles to work and approximately 97 percent of MRC employees drove to work alone pre-pandemic. With 320 parking spaces available for the current population of 300 employees, this results in a parking ratio of 1 parking space for every 0.94 employees. The draft transportation management plan included a 1 to 1.1 parking ratio within five years and a 1 to 1.35 parking ratio by 2030 which the Commission did not support. The final master plan, TMP proposed an improved interim parking ratio of 1 to 1.33 within five years and 1 to 2 parking ration by 2030. This is primarily achieved with population growth and expanded telework policies. The TMP outlines'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'varies TDM or transportation demand management strategies consistent with the policies of the federal transportation element. This includes outreach and education, enhanced transit services and connections, non-transit options, flexible scheduling and telework, and enhanced connections to the adjacent community. The TMP indicates that telework will be a significant trip reduction measure and also a challenge in that carpool and vanpool and higher cost TDM strategies such as enhanced transit connections may be more difficult to implement with a lower average onsite population. In addition to telework, the TMP recommends the FDA consider operating a shuttle between the Muirkirk Station and the MRC. However, the cost of the shuttle may be difficult to justify due to ridership numbers affected by the increased telework program. However, there will be a relatively large federal employment base in the area of the MRC that could support higher intensity transit and shuttle services as well'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'as expand the potential user base for strategies like carpooling and vanpooling. And therefore, staff emphasizes the importance of FDA partnering with other nearby federal facilities to implement ride matching and enhanced transit connections to reduce single occupancy vehicle trips and encourage transit use. As described before, 900 parking spaces will be provided for the total employee population of 1,800 employees. However, the average onsite population will be closer to 1,200 due to expanded telework policies. This results in an ample amount of parking available to those reporting to the campus each day which encourages driving to the campus versus using other forms of transportation such as public transit. In consideration of the expansion of telework post-pandemic and NCPC partnering with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments on a scenario planning study to better understand the cumulative impacts of federal telework and hybrid workplaces on our region. This study is'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'anticipated to be complete near the end of the 2023 calendar year. And NCPC will use the findings of the workplace scenario planning project to evaluate the impact of telework on the comprehensive plan parking ratios and the percentages of single occupancy vehicle travel that may increase with less commuting. The applicant also completed a traffic impact analysis as part of the TMP. The results of the traffic analysis show that the proposed increase of employees at the MRC by 2040 would have a moderate adverse impact on traffic conditions in the study area. However, many of the impacts that are experienced on the intersections would occur regardless of implementing the master plan which assumes growth due to nearby developments. And therefore, staff requests that the applicant continue coordination with state and local stakeholders to ensure that applicable offsite traffic mitigation measures are implemented prior to or concurrent with implementation'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'of the master plan. And with regard to environmental justice, staff notes that the final EIS or environmental impact statement assessed impacts associated with the development alternatives to determine if they would result in disproportionate impacts to low income and minority populations. The area surrounding the MRC includes environmental justice populations that are susceptible to environmental impacts. And staff notes that the final EIS indicates that air quality, noise, and traffic impacts would be mitigated. And there would be no adverse human health or environmental impacts that would disproportionately affect environmental justice populations. NCPC's policy for intergovernmental review included a 60-day referral period to give state and local jurisdictions an opportunity to comment on the proposed master plan. The MRC draft master plan was referred through the Maryland State Clearinghouse in June 2021. And the comments received were incorporated into the Commission's prior draft recommendations. These comments received were generally'",

There was concern about the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. And then as Commissioner Wright started off and as included in our presentation, traffic is going to be -- transportation is going to be a huge issue. So you may have -- instead of having 1,800, you may have somewhere like 1,200 given the teleworking option. But the issue with that is that we may have shuttles. And I think I heard somebody say that the shuttles might not be viable. It might be cost prohibitive because of'",
        "'CHAIR HEWLETT': 'the fewer number of people working there. But when you factor in the other nearby federal enclaves right there, then it might be more viable. So let's not discount that at all. I would also as a matter of personal privilege since we sent the letter when I was chair of the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, I would urge Jessica to consider all of the items outlined in the letter for the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission and the Planning Board. And I think that was about it for me. But thank you so much for your presentation, and I'd like to see this come to fruition.'",

I think transportation as we all know can frequently be a barrier of prosperity. And I think we need to look at the opportunities to collaborate and provide shuttle services or other transportation connectivity for everyone for their positions and their work at this place. I'm just super impressed with all the work that's gone into this. And the presentation, Ms. Free, was excellent and for your work, Ms. Jones. The environmental mitigation and the incorporation of a natural environment and the building and the surroundings and the amenities for the workforce there are just breathtaking. And I just have to say talk about a great example. It's one that really sets the standard very high for other projects. So I just commend the GSA and the FDA for your'",

    "10. WASHINGTON UNION STATION EXPANSION PROJECT": [
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Thank you very much. The motion has carried. So I'll move to the final item on our extensive agenda today and that is information presentation regarding the Washington Union Station Expansion Project. And I understand and I apologize, Mr. Flis.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': ' Flis.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Flis, okay.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': ' Yes, no worries.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' I apologize. I normally check before these meetings on the pronunciation. But I did not.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': ' No problem. It's very short.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, very good. Well, thank you.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Well, thank you, Chair Goodman and Commissioners. So today's information presentation, I'm going to provide a brief update on the status of the Washington Union Station Expansion Project. And I'm also going to outline some of the staff comments on the supplemental draft environmental impact statement which has been prepared by the Federal Railroad Administration. And it's out for public comment through today. As a reminder, the Commission reviewed concept plans for this project last July, so just a year ago, and supported the FRA's preferred alternative. So just for background, so here you can see Washington Union Station circled here in yellow located just north of the capitol building. It is the second busiest station in the Amtrak network. It includes high speed Acela service as well as the Northeast Regional Rail. VRE and MARC, our regional rail lines, also serve the station along with local and regional bus'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'service as well as Metrorail. So the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation or USRC oversees the station operation. So here you can see an image of the historic train hall itself. They include maintaining the station as well as supporting the multi-modal transportation options in addition to their retail and amenities within the station. So the site itself, this is an aerial view looking kind of to the north over the station and the associated site. It includes a historic station itself which is kind of here in the front, a bus facility which is located here as well as a parking garage. All these highlighted in yellow are under federal ownership. And in front, of course, is Columbus Plaza which is maintained by the National Park Service. There are a couple other owners in the area. Here in the kind of turquoise color, that's the Metrorail line. Purple is the'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Hopscotch Bridge or H Street Bridge which is controlled by DDOT. And then what you see here in red above the train tracks is private air rights which is controlled by Ackridge. They're a private developer who acquired that from a disposition by the GSA many years ago. And so this area has a complex ownership. But the key things to just highlight here for our newer Commissioners is this bus and parking facility which sits above the tracks today. And then the private air rights which are undeveloped at this point which will be potential mixed use in the future. So the major project components include most importantly reconfiguration of the station tracks to accommodate future growth as well as accessibility needs, a new train hall, new bus facilities as well as parking. Other major components include new concourses for accessibility, rail support spaces as well as pedestrian, bicycle'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'improvements. You'll recall that the biggest pieces of this project which were the focus of the Commission's previous discussion were the parking, the bus facility, and then the new train hall. So the Commission reviewed an old preferred alternative back in 2020. This is what I'm showing you here on the screen. This included a new train hall here in blue and then a new bus facility and a parking garage stacked above the tracks here. Very similar location to where they are today. These were basically in the same footprint or very close to the same footprint of today. So during that 2020 review, the Commission supported the overall goals of the project but expressed some significant concerns, particularly requesting that the applicant reduce the amount of parking. And they also found that configuration with the parking structure and the bus facility sitting above the tracks really didn't provide'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'a good quality urban design experience. And the Commission asked that FRA work with and coordinate further with the District and the private air rights owner to create a better planning approach to that portion of the project. So given all those comments back in 2020, FRA significantly revised the project design. And just for those who were not present in July of 2022, I'm going to walk you through the last and the revised layout which the Commission did support last year. And that's what's here on the screen. This is a rendering of the 2022 concept. Again, you can see the historic station here on the foreground. The FRA revised that old concept to give us what you see here today which includes, again, major changes, moving the parking program underground, reducing the parking program significantly. The new east- west train hall is still proposed here. It's been'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'better integrated with the bus facility. And really the big move is by moving the parking and reconfiguring the bus facility, this area above the tracks is now available for future air rights which could be developed in the future. And so what you see here ghosted in, in this kind of light blue is those future air rights. This is kind of in the area that's controlled by Ackridge. This is in the area of the current parking garage. But again, this is all freed up based upon the revised concept which the Commission supported. And so just a few details on that. Again, this is what the Commission supported. The parking has been moved underground under the tracks. Again, this eliminates that large parking structure. I'll note that the parking count has been reduced further. It was originally 1,600 in 2020. It had been reduced around six to'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'eight hundred last year. It is now down to four to five hundred spaces in one level underneath the tracks. So again, a positive improvement. Because of that movement underground, there will still need to be several ramps to access the parking. These are just a few locations that have been identified. These help distribute the access points but also help minimize traffic in some of the residential areas, really to direct them towards the more commercial streets like North Capitol. And so just a few plans of the overall concept. This is at the concourse level, still proposed. It's the new H Street concourse at the north end of site. This will provide a new access point. Here's just a rendering of that. Again, this is intended to supplement the historic station access. The historic station will still be that primary entry point. But this will provide also access'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'from NoMa as well as the Capitol Hill neighborhoods. And then moving up to the rail, again, the tracks are going to be reconfigured. This has not really changed in any of the iterations. But this is to help support the future train growth, travel growth as well as create platforms that are actually accessible. Today, they are not. And then moving up again to another layer. And all these components are essentially stacked on top of each other. This is the new bus facility which has been configured and integrated into the train hall. This will accommodate about 39 bus slips with 14 or 15 overflow slips on another level which I'll show you, with access from H Street. And so, again, this was a point of discussion with both the bus operators as well as the District and transportation officials to create an access and facility that would'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'actually work for everybody. This is really serving kind of the inner city and regional bus. Local bus service will still be provided through stops around the site as it is today. So here's just a rendering of the bus facility. Again, it's enclosed. You'll be able to walk right off your bus into the new train hall and then either catch your train or go to another mode of travel depending on your destination. And then this is just a rendering of the train hall. These are all conceptual. The designs still need to be further developed. But these are kind of giving you a sense of the space and how the different modes of transportation are connecting. And then moving up one more level, this is the pickup and drop off which is at the top. And I will just show you a rendering of that. And then'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'just at the top of the tracks and this is kind of what I would call the deck over the tracks and all the kind of components I just described. There will be a new central open space with skylights to support the concourses below. As I mentioned, what's shown here in kind of a pink color are future building footprints. This is the air rights area that I mentioned previously. The future design and development of that is to be determined. And so additional coordination is going to be required between FRA, USRC, and Ackridge to help coordinate all of these components. And then there's just a rendering of that again, looking down that central space towards the new pickup and drop off area. Again, just massing in here what the air rights development could look like. So that's just a summary of the project design. Again, that's consistent'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'with what the Commission saw last year. And so just in terms of where this project is, since the Commission's last review, the FRA restarted the NEPA process and prepared a supplemental draft impact statement. This is part of the NEPA process. The supplemental draft evaluated the impacts of this new alternative since it was created after the draft EIS was actually released. So they had to go back and create and analyze this new preferred alternative. So as part of that process, staff has prepared some initial comments on the supplemental draft EIS which will be sending to the FRA. So in terms of overall comments, we believe the supplemental draft is thorough. It is consistent with the concept the Commission reviewed and supported in July of last year. Based upon our review, there are clear operational benefits from the project, including that increased rail capacity and multi-modal access'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'to the station. This is consistent with the project goals. There are also adverse impacts, including increased traffic and impacts to historic and cultural resources. This is not inconsistent with some of the other alternatives that were analyzed, neither inconsistent nor surprising. And these will require minimization and mitigation. So regarding impacts, we will be working with FRA and consulting parties to prepare a programmatic agreement to address adverse impacts on historic properties, particularly the Washington Union Station and the Washington Union Station site. This is pursuant to Section 106 process. And so we are in the process of working with FRA and other signatories to draft that document. Regarding traffic impacts, we do recommend in our comments that the applicant continue to work with DDOT. And we also recommend they continue to work with the bus operators who have been an integral part of the process over the last'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'few years. Also prior to the Commission's next review, we do recommend the applicant provide a better sense of who's going to be responsible for the various components of the project as well as the mitigation matters, developed both for NEPA and Section 106 process. This is consistent with the previous Commission request last July, really to ensure that the project is designed and implemented in a cohesive and coherent way. And then finally our last comment is we do request a list of any comments received through the supplemental draft EIS process as well as FRA responses so that we can be aware of any outstanding issues prior to the next submission to this Commission. So just to wrap things up, we will be providing these comments to FRA and as part of the NEPA process. And we'll continue to work with them on the Section 106 programmatic agreement.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Following this public comment period, FRA said they will be working to prepare the final EIS and the record of decision. That is anticipated over the next six months or so. And then we do expect the project to return to the Commission for preliminary review at some point, likely over the next six months or so, though the timing of that has not yet been set. And that concludes my summary. Happy to answer any questions you might have about the project. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much, Michael -- I'm sorry, Mr. Matthew, Mr. Flis. Appreciate your thorough presentation. And this was an information presentation so it does not require a motion. So we'll begin. Does the Commission have any questions for Mr. Flis on his presentation?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Madam Chair, I had a question.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' So going back quite a ways, I remember one of the outstanding pieces that we always knew we'd eventually need to come back to is the air rights, the way that they're kind of meted out right now. So the plans previously had always contemplated that there are a few tweaks that were going to need to be made between FRA and Ackridge to make this all happen. But I don't think that I've asked the question with these new concept designs that we all seem to like much more. What is -- because you mentioned the footprint in the future development. As far as the actual Union Station project, does FRA control everything that it needs to control air rights-wise in order to fit this into the current box?'",
        "'MR. FLIS': ' Yeah, so that's a good question. So it's our understanding that there are portions that will be need to be locked at a minimum. I'm not sure exactly where those footprints are. But there are skylights in the head house that I think are on Akridge land. So there's going to have to be some reconciliation of that property. I know this question has come up. It came up recently at a consulting party's meeting. So FRA is aware of that. They're still discussing the approach. So I can't really speak to how that will be resolved. But I know they were looking at that issue, so --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Underlying that question is just that I hope that as things look like they're finally kind of on track and we have these great new designs at least for the FRA side of it, I want to make sure that it's not going to be held up in red tape for three years because Akridge needs to get back 50 square feet or something like that. So I'm glad to hear that's what people are thinking about and talking about still.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. I echo your concerns on that same issues. Are there other questions for Mr. Flis? Hearing none, then we'll run around the table. And Vice-Chair Hewlett, you are first. VICE-'",
        "'CHAIR HEWLETT': ' Okay. First of all, thank you for the presentation and thank you for going over some of the prior history that some of us newbies weren't aware of. And the air rights, all of that is pretty exciting. And as much as I love Union Station, this new plan, expansion plan, seems great. I know you're going to have more detailed presentations later. And I'm particularly thankful and glad for the increased accessibility, particularly to the platforms. That's so important in this day and age. But it really, really looks good. So thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Vice-Chair Hewlett. Commissioner Green?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Thank you very much. Much needed and looking forward to it. Thank you. No questions.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Green. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' I yield my time to the next Commissioner. We've seen this at least three times already, right, Matt? At least, and I'm sure --(Simultaneous speaking.)'",
        "'MR. FLIS': ' Yes, going back to 2017.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yeah, okay. So I'll shut up.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Wright. Commissioner Dixon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I'm okay. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'So I'll just be brief. So I want to say since the last time we saw these presentations, the one comment that I - -the only negative thing I've heard kind of amongst people that watch this stuff. And I know that we're only at concept. But now that we're moving into actual design, I do want to throw out there for the record I get a lot -- I hear a lot of complaints that none of these renderings have any seating whatsoever in it. And I know this is the inside of a building. But we are the Capital Planning Commission. If we saw a giant plaza that had absolutely no seating or anything, we'd probably say something about it. So I just want to kind of put that on record that I think as the plans continue to move forward and those details are starting to put'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'into the presentations, I think that everyone can avoid some problems if we start thinking about those issues the next time this comes to us and we have these detailed renderings. I think that seating in a giant train station right now is a problem at Union Station. And this is beautiful. But not a single rendering showed anywhere to sit. So I just hope that the Commission keeps that in mind as we engage in the next steps going forward.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Cash. Commissioner Giachetti?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GIACHETTI': ' No comments here. Thank you very much.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Commissioner Cozart?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Yes, thank you for the presentation. I want to associate myself with comments from Commissioner Cash specifically related to the air rights development. It's really important that that's done in a cohesive way so we're really thinking about a development alongside public and civic spaces. So I think that's really important and that's something that we'll be looking at through the Section 106 process and reinforcing through that process.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Absolutely. Thank you, Commissioner Cozart. Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Appreciate the presentation. It may be the shortest presentation discussion we've had on Union Station during my time here. That's a very good presentation. I have no other comments.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner McMahon. Commissioner Stidham?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' Thank you for the presentation. This has been a long time coming. So good to see it take it to this point. No comments from me. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Stidham. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' I appreciate all the comments. I'll associate myself with one particular one. I think it was Commissioner Cash talking about the seating. If I added the hours of my life that I have stood waiting for a train in Union Station, I appreciate that more than you know. Let's talk about where people sit when they're waiting for a train, among other things other than that which is really a minor issue. I enjoyed the presentation. I appreciate it. I love seeing what the possibilities are here for an iconic place.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'Thank you, Commissioner Argo. And I'll just start right there. It is an iconic place. And again, as a small child traveling from Iowa and then as an adult traveling to D.C. And as a married woman with children coming to D.C. into Union Station, it is iconic. It's a national icon. And while I'm new to this and as the Vice-Chair pointed out, there's been a lot of catching up to do to get through a lot of this past information on the Union Station project. I just want to say thank you to you, Mr. Flis, for the presentation but also for all the tremendous work and research and effort that's gone into this project. And I'm very eager, as I said, to continue to see the collaborative work with FRA and the proponents of this project and the layout. So a lot of work has been done.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'We're grateful to you for that and your team. And we're also looking forward to continued collaboration with other partners in the community and with the FRA. And looking forward to the next presentation. So are there any further comments or questions regarding this information presentation on Union Station? (No audible response.)'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Well, hearing none, this concludes our agenda. And I want to thank you again, Mr. Flis, for that presentation. And our next Commission meeting is going to be Thursday, September 7th, 2023 at 1:00 p.m. And we have a month off. So everyone enjoy your month of August. And if there is no further business, this session stands adjourned. Thank you all.'"
