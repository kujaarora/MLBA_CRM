    "5. ACTION ITEM CONSTITUTION GARDENS ": [
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'Good afternoon, Chair Goodmann, and Commissioners. The National Park Service in partnership with the Trust for the National Mall, submitted preliminary site development plans for the Rehabilitation of Constitution Gardens. Concept design for the full Constitution Gardens site was reviewed and strongly supported by the Commission, at the October 2014 meeting. Phase 1 was approved by the Commission in 2015, and completed construction in 2018. The project focused on the Lock Keeper's House relocation, and plaza construction. The proposed Constitution Gardens Lake Project under preliminary review today, is the second phase of rehabilitation. The National Park Service plans to develop a visitor pavilion, as well as the remainder of the surrounding landscape at a later date, to achieve the complete vision of Constitution Gardens. The Commission's preliminary review of these parks and open Space projects, focuses on whether the applicant addressed the comments and recommendations made during concept review and'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'topics such as landscape design, sustainability, programming, and consistency with the comprehensive plan. In the following slides, I will provide an overview of the site history, existing conditions, and the proposed project, as well as staff recommendations for project refinement. Constitution Gardens was originally designed by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, with landscape architect Dan Kiley, and constructed in 1976 in commemoration of the Nation's Bicentennial. The proposed rehabilitation respects the original site design, while reimagining the site for a sustainable future, serving as a visitor destination on the National Mall. The gardens in their present deteriorated condition do not meet the original design intent, or the vision of the 2010 National Mall plan. There are circulation challenges, the area lacks amenities, and is under utilized. And poor soil conditions and drainage occur throughout the gardens and affect vegetation, causing significant tree health decline. This is the site plan for the'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'full site concept reviewed in 2014. The Phase 2 preliminary site development plans are generally consistent with the concept plans reviewed by the Commission, though more limited in scope. At concept review, the Commission requested additional simulations of the surrounding views and vistas, both to and from the park, in order to better understand the implications of proposed changes to topography. While some grading is part of the current project, the major topography within the limit of work will not be significantly different than the land form that exists there today. The proposal preserves existing views in, out, and through the gardens. The proposed Phase 2 design includes rehabilitation of the lake, surrounding gardens, existing event plaza, plaza terraces, and Signers' Island. New elements include a lake ring, path and deck, wetlands and aquatic shelf along the lake edge, an event lawn and stage, as well as new wood, a'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'new wood bridge to Signers' Island. One of the primary goals of the project is to create an ecologically sustainable lake and garden, through increased lake depth to a maximum of 12 feet, to provide improved habitat for fish and other organisms. New biological and mechanical filtration to improve water quality. Amended soils to improve plant health, and diversified plantings. As noted in public comment, staff recommend the applicant consider incorporating native pollinator plantings, such as common milkweed, into the proposed meadows and flowering garden areas as the project is developed. The applicant has stated that they are currently refining the plant palette, to create a more robust species list that takes into account seasonal expression, as well as pollinator species, including common milkweed. And, to reduce the percentage of grasses that do not support pollinators. A proposed aquatic shelf along the lake edge would provide wetlands for biofiltration, and'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'would have both a functional and aesthetic purpose similar to the wetlands at the Glenstone Museum. These ecological improvements would provide environmental education opportunities, such as student programming, citizen science species counts, and self-guided tours. A unique feature of the design is the proposed lake ring, and lake ring path, which would provide a new perspective and experience. The walkway sits just above the water's surface, and would allow visitors to get out within the vast expanse of water in the middle of the lake. The project also proposes a variety of flexible spaces that can be used for gathering, events, and programming. With the potential influx of park users, the quality of visitor amenities and comfort will be critical to Constitution Gardens' future success, and utilization. Staff recommends the applicant explore a few refinements to improve the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': '13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 visitor experience, that I will highlight on future slides. Flexible programming spaces at the east end of the lake include the event plaza, terraces, and lake ring deck. The existing terraces and plaza are currently deteriorating. The proposal includes a renovation of the plaza and terraces, with a new lake ring deck for flexible use with moveable furniture. This is a rendering looking from the terraces to the lake ring deck, and lake beyond. These capacity studies show the potential for flexible event use of the deck, and terraces. Staff recommends the applicant explore providing universal design improvements to the terraces, between the event plaza and the lake ring deck, to create a centralized accessible route, rather than only peripheral paths, and access to the terrace spaces. Ample shade elements should also be provided throughout the gardens, particularly in gathering'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'and seating areas, such as these where canopy trees will be limited due -- to allow for flexible programming. A flexible event lawn for gathering and performances would be provided on the south side of the lake. The lawn would have a gradual slope overlooking the lake, and a stage for outdoor events. The proposed event lawn and stage can be used for informal picnics, and day-to-day gatherings, or for more organized events such as lectures, small concerts, movie nights, or exercise groups. There would also be fishing in the lake, as there is today. Staff recommends the applicant consider designating consolidated fishing areas with seating at the, at the lake edge. And ample room for casting, equipment, and comfortable width for pedestrians to pass. Staff supports the range of amenities and programming spaces proposed, but notes that the temporary playground on Constitution Gardens recently installed for Beyond Granite, shown'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'in the top left, highlights the demand for new children's spaces. Staff recommends the applicant continue to explore ways in which the design of the gardens, and the future visitor pavilion, can further activate Constitution Gardens for children and families in this phase, or at a future phase of rehabilitation. These phases should be designed in a way that is compatible with the gardens, and could use nature related themes, as shown in these example images. Another rehabilitated space along the lake is Signers' Island, the location of the memorial to the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence. The lake project will remove and rehabilitate the 56 Signers' memorial, and reinstall it onto a reconstructed island. The island reconstruction will include two bridges in order to improve access to the island, and create an improved arrival to the memorial. Currently, there is only one bridge leading to the memorial,'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'that is not code compliant, as currently constructed. Here is a view of the reconstructed and accessible stone bridge leading to Signer's Island, and the memorial. And, a view of the proposed wood bridge to the island. New low site walls will also be constructed on Signer's Island, at the lake ring deck, and event lawn, utilizing a similar vocabulary as the low walls constructed with Phase 1, on the corner of 17th Street and Constitution Avenue. Materials proposed include granite cobble paving along the lake perimeter, lake ring path, and Signers' Island. Asphalt paving along surrounding pathways, concrete paving in the event plaza, and wood decking along the terraces and lake ring deck. There was public comment concerning the stability, safety, and comfort of the proposed cobble paving, particularly for cyclists, wheelchair users, and runners. The applicant has noted that the cobblestone paving is designed to be flat, and'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'level. The stabilized sand setting, flush joints, and concrete sub-slab, are designed to keep the cobblestone free of settlement and irregularities over time, even within this high traffic environment. They note that this is a durable system, which has been utilized on many public projects throughout the country, including at the National 9/11 Memorial in New York City. The lake is proposed to include functional and aesthetic aeration features, for improved water quality. Also, new lighting would be provided F along the lake edge, and throughout the gardens. This is a rendering showing the proposed low-profile lake edge lighting elements. The stone lake edge is also proposed as an opportunity for an inscription of the Constitution. Finally, this is an overall view of the proposed Constitution Gardens rehabilitation, looking east over the lake to the Washington Monument beyond. There was public comment asking about public involvement in the National Environmental'",

This is a phased project that has taken many years to implement. It is helpful to remind everyone of the process that has occurred thus far. The National Park Service served as lead federal agency and closely coordinated the Section 106 process, and NEPA assessment. The process covered both Phase 1, and Phase 2 of the Rehabilitation of Constitution Gardens. Public comment periods, and public meetings were held throughout 2014 and 2015, as listed on this slide. The Section 106 memorandum of agreement, and NEPA finding of no significant impact, were executed in August of 2015. NCPC is a cooperating agency, and will complete our NEPA compliance at the time of final review. Staff recommend the Commission approve the preliminary site development plans for the Phase 2 Rehabilitation of Constitution Gardens, with the'",
        "'MS. SHIPMAN': 'comments highlighted throughout the presentation, and listed here. Further, staff recommends the Commission commend the National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall, for their efforts to improve the condition of Constitution Gardens, to create a sustainable and functional lake ecosystem, and establish a destination that serves visitors, and residents. I would like to introduce the National Park Service Superintendent Jeff Reinbold, who is present to make a few remarks about the project. And also note that members of the applicant team from PWP Landscape Architecture, and Hensel Phelps, are available to answer any questions from the Commission. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. REINBOLD': 'Great, thank you, Ms. Shipman for giving the presentation. As many times as I've seen that, I get excited every time I see it. I hope you do, too. I do want to thank everybody for your work on the concept on this, and the recommendations today. And then, everyone who's helped us achieve a level of excellence with this project. We are incredibly excited about it. It is one of our signature projects leading into the semi-quincentennial in 2026. I do want to say a word just about the importance of this space, that is sometimes overlooked. I think we all know as it was in the presentation, that Constitution Gardens was a gift for the Bicentennial. It is desperately in need of a refresh. But I think today we also see the importance of this design space as not only providing respite, but being a, more than a'",
        "'MR. REINBOLD': 'complement, but being support to the memorials and to the monuments. It's a place where people have a chance to reflect, to decompress. To even prepare for some of these, their visits that are to come. And so, we're incredibly thankful to the Trust for the National Mall for making this possible. To the design team for ensuring that the intent and the best attributes of the original design are captured in a modern, more functional and engaging way. I do want to comment though, on the one remark about opportunities for children. It's something that we've been thinking a lot about. I do think the reaction we saw to the playground during Beyond Granite, to the playgrounds that are over at Franklin Park, show an interest from kids, I think to be recognized. And, to be engaged. And if you think about the Mall, it's a pretty adult presentation.'",
        "'MR. REINBOLD': 'And so one of the things that we will look at is, are there opportunities here to maybe bring in playful elements. Opportunities for reaching kids in a way that really complements what's presented out at the lake. I think it's kind of a designer's dream maybe, to toy with that and see if there are elements you could introduce that again, make it much more kind of engaging and interesting for children. Not necessarily a playground, but something that really speaks to them, and connects with them. So, we're actually excited about that recommendation. We'll see what we can do as part of the upcoming work, but particularly as we look at the future phases. Are there opportunities to reach kids in a more direct way? I would also say part of it is about play for them, and connecting to them. But I think one of the things'",
        "'MR. REINBOLD': 'that really struck me was when I was working on the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, one of the 9/11 sites. And, we worked with the Fred Rogers Center to understand how kids will experience this site. I think we probably underestimate their need for spaces like this. While their parents or groups that they're with are experiencing pretty heavy stories at a lot of the war memorials, places like these I think, are incredibly important for children in a way that we can sometimes overlook. So, we embrace that recommendation and look to working with the design team on it. So, thanks again for the chance to present today, and for considering this.'",

BERNE': 'The submission for this project states on the page entitled Meadows and Lawns with Specimen Trees, that Constitution Gardens will have lawns and other areas that will contain frequently mowed grass. The page also states that the National Park Service will install native grass, and grass carex mixes in other areas. Potential species include fescue turf, red fescue, little blue stem, and add carex species. However, these plants are wind pollinated. They do not produce pollen, which attracts and feeds pollinators. I'll discuss this a little more later on the next presentation. The 2015 National promote the health of honeybees Strategy to and other pollinators, laid out federal actions that would increase by 2020, the Eastern monarch butterfly population to 2,025 million butterflies that over winter in Mexico. The National Strategy also proposed actions that would restore or enhance, 7 million acres of land for pollinators over a five year'",
        "'MR. BERNE': 'period. The Park Service should therefore, remove areas that will receive frequent mowing or be planted with grasses and other carexes, and hedges. The NPS should replace those, replace those spaces with areas that support monarch butterflies, and other pollinators, native pollinators. To achieve this, the Park Service should only install flowering nectar plants that are native to the mid-Atlantic region. The Park Service should install many common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca plants. A U.S. Forest Service publication states that over 458 insects feed on common milkweed. It's a megamarket for milk insects, as they say. The publication further states that common milkweed is among the most important food plants for monarch pattern caterpillars. The submission lists possible species of plants. However, common milkweed is not on the list, even though the plant thrives in sunny areas and develops attractive clusters of purple-pink flowers. Please therefore, recommend that the Park Service'",

Derrick Adams' installation America's Playground. I'm struck therefore, with the gap between what kinds of activities the plaza offers right now, and what it will offer when construction is complete. Events, but no play. For all the improvements proposed by the Park Service in cooperation with the Trust, none have advanced the most neglected part of the vision set out in the McMillan Plan, that of the Washington Commons. Envisioning a lawn filling most of the Tidal Basin they proposed, they promised the people of the District of Columbia ball grounds, and this is quoting, ball grounds, tennis courts, open air gymnasiums for use, sand piles and swings for children.

But the sand piles, swings, and gymnasiums remained elusive. They were promised again in the campaigns to establish and fund this Commission's predecessors. But as Congressional investigations found in 1936, NCPPC had failed to deliver even as New Deal work programs realized the skeleton in the 1902 plan.

Would kids run through the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial if they could work out their popsicle highs on a playground nearby? Those of us who live in the District are privileged to have spaces like Constitution Gardens but still, neither the current form nor this design live up to the promises made to the parents of the District, and to all Americans who overheat on commemorative pavement.

And, we will be looking at how to incorporate that in a way that is meaningful, and really connected to the Garden itself and what it represents. So, thank you Beyond Granite. It has been a wonderful experience to help show, you know, the importance of spaces like that. Or you know, similar in these more formal spaces that we do.

I'm now focused on when my grandkids come to visit, and have them be part of, and know, this city, and learn to love this city as, as I have. So, the comments about connecting to kids resonated to me, to really pay attention to how kids will respond and interact with this space. And maybe in a more definitive way than we heard today. So, and where, what was the other comment? Oh, the comment that was made about, about Americans overheating on concrete pavement, and, to take that into consideration. And the comment about Franklin Park being a good'",

        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'One thing I really like about this project is the way, it's a good example of the challenges in restoring and caring for the modern landscapes, which are very minimal in approach. And, one of the things I liked about this is that it didn't overwhelm the original design of the project and really supported the opportunity it created and I appreciate that. So, it's quite a challenge and it's easy to, easy to narrow in. So, and as the father of a 6 year old, I appreciated the popsicle high comment. And I know it is true, you know, the spaces that my daughter loves, and the museums that she asks us to take her to, are places where she can play as a part of the museum and it becomes this place that she has to see, likes to see. And we don't drag her, she drags us.'",

But I think, I would urge that we, I've heard of some conversation, back channel conversation, about oh, but it's a formal landscape and we've got to keep it so. And it's got to be just so dignified. And I don't know. I think it's pretty undignified for children to be screaming and yelling, and running through contemplative memorials. So, we've got to let, provide a place for them to let off some steam if we want to take them with us to these memorials. And so, while, I mean, and there's plenty of places who do it, that have done it well. I'm thinking about the Vondelpark in Amsterdam. It doesn't have to be some gaudy Little Tikes,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'you know, horror show. It can be tastefully done. And kids know, kids can make a play site out of just about anything. So, it can be minimal. It doesn't have to be disruptive of a formal landscape. And I really think that of all the places on the Mall that are suited to this, there's a gold mine of opportunity here. And, I would urge the Park Service to take advantage of it.'",

So I mean, this is one of my favorite areas down in the Mall, but unless you know it's there, you really don't find it. Like, this is one of those things that locals stumble upon. But I actually did the measurement, and it's about a quarter of a mile walk between the World War II Memorial, and the little path by the restrooms from the Reflecting Pool that goes up. If there was like, one more connection down to the Reflecting Pool, I think you get a lot more foot traffic. People just kind of wandering off there. But I mean, it's access from the north, but none from the south right now. So, if there's, I know that the landscape and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'the grade is kind of tough. But if there's any more connection that can be made down to the Reflecting Pool, I think you'd actually take a lot of pressure off those paths along the Reflecting Pool, and you have a lot more people that wander up there and see it maybe by the pavilion. So, just something to keep in mind. Connectivity is a big thing, especially in that busy part of the Mall. And, I think you can kind of solve two problems with all that overcrowding down by the Reflecting Pool, and just get more people up there. So, but that's my only other comment, so thanks.'",

I think those were, the input was very important. I think we can make some improvements here, especially with the pollinator issue. I think that as the commissioner pointed out, the Park Service does this and it sounds like it can be, you know, seamlessly blended into the original design intent, along with the play areas for children. I was so fortunate to be able to see Constitutional Gardens, when I was touring with the opening of Beyond Granite. And I was really a bit alarmed at the, sort of the condition of, of Constitutional Gardens. Because it is a relic of the Bicentennial, and it seems to, it needed attention.

The National Park Service has submitted final site development plans for the rehabilitation of approximately 6,800 linear feet of the failing seawall along portions of the Tidal Basin, and West Potomac Park, in Washington, D.C. NPS only has funding for rehabilitation and repair at this time, and is therefore, taking a phased approach of first stabilizing sections of the wall, and restoring the historic functional height, allowing more time to consider additional measures in the future. Going forward, NPS will continue to work with NCPC, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Legacy Committee, and other stakeholders on future planning efforts to consider broader climate change impacts and solutions for the Tidal Basin area, as well as West and East Potomac Parks. The Commission provided comments on the concept plans at its January 5,'",

In June the Commission approved the preliminary site development plans, requesting more information on time frames for the Tidal Basin comprehensive plan, and the cultural landscape reports, also referred to as CLRs, for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial. In response, NPS anticipates the planning for the Tidal Basin will start this fall, with public scoping and engagement beginning in spring 2024. The Commission also requested time frames and commitments for completing the CLRs, for both memorials. NPS has shared that the CLR for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, is funded for 2024. NPS has not yet secured funding for the FDR Memorial cultural landscape report, but they have asked for the funds in their 2026 budget request. In June the Commission also requested more information on how the comprehensive plan will address the'",

They will be considered as historic properties as they work through the planning and compliance process, which will include public engagement, and Section 106 consulting parties meetings. Since the June Commission meeting, NPS and NCPC staff have met with representatives of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Legacy Committee. NCPC staff agrees with many of the issues raised by the committee, which are reflected in our recommendations for this review, and discussed in this presentation. Staff does believe that the applicant has addressed the Commission's previous comments, as part of the final submission. As a reminder, the seawall area along the Potomac River and Tidal Basin, was created as part of a land reclamation project beginning in the mid-19th century. West Potomac Park is a U.S. National Park in Washington, D.C., adjacent to'",

The park is the site of many national landmarks, including the Korean War Veterans' Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial. You can see all of these locations on the map on the screen. West Potomac Park, as well as East Potomac Park, and the area encompassing the Tidal Basin, were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The seawalls are considered contributing features to the National Register of Historic Districts. For a final review, the Commission focuses on the following. Did the applicant address the comments and recommendations made during the preliminary review? Did the applicant provide requested information; and, are there any outstanding issues? For this final'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'review, the design approach for the rehabilitation of the seawalls in the project area remains consistent with what was submitted and approved for concept and preliminary reviews. Now as a recap from what we saw back in June, I will share some images of the existing conditions resulting from the issues with the seawalls, as well as provide an orientation to the project area. As these existing photographs show, over the years, the seawalls have significantly settled, leading to water overtopping the seawalls, as well as poor drainage. This has led to reduced public access, and damaged the cultural landscape and park infrastructure, resulting in negative impacts to visitor use and experience. This slide shows the extent of the current project area, which is outlined in yellow, consisting of 6,800 linear feet. This project will address the immediate issues of the failing seawall, in locations demonstrating the highest degree of'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'settlement and erosion. The applicant has indicated the project will not address longer term rises in sea level at this time, but the structural approach could allow for additional wall height in the future if determined appropriate, and approved following a comprehensive analysis. The portion of the Tidal Basin that has been the project is approximately 2,000 linear feet, or 19 percent of the full Tidal Basin, which is 10,450 linear feet. In this area, the seawalls have the highest degree of settlement and erosion. The remaining 4,800 linear feet of the project comprises the West Potomac Park seawalls. Staff acknowledges that while the Tidal Basin inlet gates are not part of this project by NPS, we agree with the FDR Memorial Legacy Committee, that they should be analyzed and evaluated for use in the future. Therefore, staff requests that NPS evaluates several alternatives to address sea level rise in'",

WEBB': 'the Tidal Basin Comprehensive Plan, including raising the seawall, using the existing Tidal Basin gates, or installing new gates, and other possible solutions such as nature based approaches. This project will increase the percentage of total park area that is open, and safely accessible for public visitation by reducing instances of flooding, overtopping, and pooling of water. In addition, a significant amount of deferred maintenance backlog will be addressed by the project. After careful consideration to address the immediate issues with the stabilization of the seawalls in the project area, NPS determined that the design should incorporate a pile-supported foundation extending to the bedrock, to avoid future settlement. This solution also allows the wall heights to be raised in the future, if determined an appropriate solution and approved. However, as I mentioned previously, additional comprehensive study will be necessary to consider whether this or other approaches, will appropriately address sea'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'level rise. Therefore, staff supports the National Park Service's project goals to rehabilitate the Tidal Basin and West Potomac Park seawalls, to return the seawalls to their historic functional height, and improve visitor accessibility and experience. As this is a rehabilitation project, the goal is to reestablish the seawall's historic functional height, and reconstruct it along the historic alignment. When first constructed and then adhered to in subsequent modifications and extensions, the seawall was built to an elevation of six feet above mean low water. Settlement combined with rising sea levels, have resulted in the wall residing much closer to the water's surface. And when we say historic functional height, this means the relationship between the water level, the height of the seawall, and the landscaping adjacent to the wall. To correct this, the selected top of the wall elevation is based on a height of six feet above current'",

This results in the elevation increase of 4.75 feet within the Tidal Basin. The applicant has indicated the project will not cause new overtopping in other areas of the Tidal Basin, outside the current project area. Where the rehabilitated walls meet existing walls not included in the project, the difference in height are minimal. The sidewalk transition will be accommodated through a slight slope. Staff finds that returning the proposed section of the seawall back to their historic functional height will not cause additional flooding on adjacent areas, such as the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, based on the analysis presented by the National Park Service. However, flooding along the seawall will persist and worsen, especially with the rain and storm events becoming more frequent. The top'",

This is to account for the additional impact and overtopping of larger waves, which do not impact the walls inside the Tidal Basin. The Potomac River and the Tidal Basin are part of a joint open system because there are no, excuse me, because there are currently no effective flood controls separating the two water bodies. Therefore, the height of the water within the Potomac River matches very closely the height of the water within the Tidal Basin. Consistent with the concept and the preliminary design, the final design includes foundations that bear on bedrock, relieving the weight of the structure on the soils that caused the previous settlement. This type of foundation could allow for future capacity for the walls to be raised vertically, in response to future sea level rise and increasing storm'",

Two of the main requirements of this project are to prevent future settlement of the sea wall, and maintain the historic character. The proposed pile-supported foundation details reflect what NPS believes to provide ease of construction and reduced costs, while preventing future settlement. Staff notes that the Commission will need to approve any solution, including possibly raising the height of the sea walls in the future. To the extent possible, the stones of the historic wall will be salvaged and reused in the rehabilitation. The proposed face of the wall maximizes the reuse of the historic stone, maintains the historic ashlar stone look, and has the ability to be built upon to combat future projected higher water levels, if approved. The preferred approach includes maximizing reuse of historic stones, utilizes even coursing and stone size, with rough and smooth'",

Trees removed will be replaced in kind, or a more acceptable and suitable species for the location, the soil conditions, and the park, as determined appropriate by an interdisciplinary team led by historic landscape architects at a ratio meeting NCPC's tree policy. As such, staff finds that the project includes planting more resilient vegetation in identified areas, informed by the Tidal Basin Cultural Landscape Report, with tree removal and replacement that meets NCPC's comprehensive plan policies.

Staff notes that solutions to address rising sea levels could have more significant impacts on the landscape and nearby memorials, and will need to consider historic preservation, visitor experience, sustainability, and program needs, and be well coordinated among stakeholders. Staff notes that NPS will complete cultural landscape reports for both the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in the next few years. While NPS actively seeks funding for the FDR Memorial Cultural Landscape Report in fiscal year 26, they will and already do consider both of these memorials contributing'",

To conclude, staff recognizes NPS's focus for this project is rehabilitating the seawalls to their historic functional height, in the areas that have the most significant erosion and settlement, resulting in daily overtopping of the wall. This diminishes visitor experience and access in the Tidal Basin area, and leads to further degradation of the landscape. This project is not intended to address the larger issues of flooding, and sea level rise. As the applicant begins work on the comprehensive plan, staff requests NPS continue to coordinate with NCPC, the Army Corps of Engineers, partner federal agencies, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Legacy Committee, and other consulting parties as they commence work on the comprehensive plan for the Tidal Basin area.

It was one of our top Great American Outdoors Act projects for the entire Service. It is the largest design-build contract in the history of the National Park Service. Competition for those funds, for Great American Outdoors funding, is fierce, to say the least. And we had a very small window to successfully compete for this funding before it was assigned to another project, and there are worthy projects throughout the Park Service. So I want to thank everyone who helped us get to this point and be able to meet those deadlines and take advantage of'",

This creates a foundation for addressing future climate change, sea level rise. But also incredibly important to us is it is a proof of concept for how we can address the failing seawalls in other areas that at this point maybe have not failed to this extent but are much more complicated and are going to need more focused attention. So having this proof of concept helps us to be able to demonstrate the work that could be done in these other areas and secure funding on the, hopefully on the scale that we were able to on this project.

        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' So there was the comment that there's the possibility of looking at the locks on the Ohio Drive Bridge for possible future reopening up or just to help control flooding. But I would just put the comment out there that -- or ask the question is there any possibility that if the bridge is touched, that the pedestrian experience could be improved down there? Because that's kind of a choke point down there. And if you're going to have all these new sidewalks reopened, I'm just thinking of the pedestrian experience, especially there, as you get into West Potomac Park.'",
        "'MR. REINBOLD': ' Yeah, I would ask either maybe Commissioner Stidham or consultants to address the gates themselves. I will say one of the reasons we're excited about the comprehensive plan is looking at pedestrian circulation around the Tidal Basin. And admittedly that is a choke point and something that we need to be able to address.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' So I can address the gates a bit. The gates are actually under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers. So, and they are working on a feasibility study to look at the conditions of those gates and determine what repairs are needed. But to reiterate, those were not intended to ever be a flood control device. Now, do we think there is a potential for them to be? Possibly, but it's really the Army Corps who would have to make the decision for making any changes. But we are working with them and will continue to work with them through their feasibility study and as we move on to the comprehensive plan. And as Superintendent Reinbold said, we will be looking at access and how to make those improvements as part of the larger plan and recognize that's a choke point. So thank you for your comment.'",

Furthermore, projections provided by renowned scientist Dr. Jim O'Donnell shows that the encroachment of the flooding risk on the rooms of the FDR Memorial will keep coming in years to come. And so we maintain that this project could have done more to take into consideration the entire Tidal Basin and not kick that issue down the road for how many more years to come. We have an ongoing concern about the consideration of alternatives,'",

As a contribution to this entire process, our organization secured an initial analysis by an independent civil engineer, you have a copy of it, who has experience in old tidal gate modifications that stem daily tidal flooding. Why this wasn't explored further, I leave that to you all to consider. And we still think it's a potential lost opportunity, but we look forward to it being explored in the further other phases.

In the letter, we ask for this project to be paused so that the Park Service can accelerate its work on the comprehensive plan for the Tidal Basin so that this project be considered in its totality of an overall plan that provides long-term, sustainable solution to flooding risk of all the memorials and their seawalls along the Tidal Basin.

Those, the flood gates controlled by the Army Corps, etc. It'll be interesting to see how this all progresses. And I expect that we -- will we ask -- then let me ask you, Madam Chairman, will we ask for a, you know, a'",

So why don't we work with the Park Service staff to do that, and then we'll identify an appropriate time over the coming months when that can be done.

        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' As in June, appreciate the technical aspect of the solution. I understand that it is a short-term solution, but do appreciate that work that went into it and the great technical challenge presented by this. My only concern is I would prefer that both cultural landscapes studies undertaken before the comprehensive report, partly due to the scale of this project and the complexity of the undertaking, it would seem to make the most sense to have that information available at the time of the comprehensive study. But I do appreciate the overall project and the critical importance of it. And also appreciate the emphasis in fact that this is just the beginning and this must be part of a larger comprehensive solution to address this problem. Thank you.'",

And I feel the need to come to the defense of the National Park Service, even though GSA has no dog in this fight. But it is unrealistic and unfair, I believe, to take them to the woodshed for not planning -- not executing a plan that goes far enough into the future. And this is a difficult case to make without sounding like a bureaucrat, but we live in a world that -- where money and schedule are paramount. And you just can't get around that. And long-term money is almost impossible to nail down. So it seems unfair and -- to hold them accountable for planning into the future, which is impossible for them to do, on a very practical level. And so if you followed the logic stream that'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'suggests, well, we should be, you know, doing a comprehensive project and anything, you know, doing it all, or it's everything or bust, that would suggest that we do nothing until we can do everything. And if we do that, God, I just can't even imagine. We could use that as a rationale to pretty much kick the can down the road on everything, because you got to work with what you have. No year money is not a thing. It's just not, it's not what happens in the government. So the fact that the Park Service has taken the time to explain and frankly had the patience to keep going with this and explain that planning has been made to quite literally lay the foundation for the future and they're still getting tarred and feathered for it I just think is wrong. And the behavior during the last meeting'",

I mean, it's a long time to wait for a cultural landscape report. But if the FDR Memorial is -- the organization is a 501(c)(3), perhaps this a fundraising goal that they should set for themselves, so that the money could be raised before fiscal '26. I just feel the need to mark the fact that, you know, I think Mr. Reinbold is talking about competition for this money. We have to fight inside the government for the money that we get to do these projects. A cultural landscape report is probably, although we all think it's very important, it has to compete in a broad spectrum of shovel-ready projects and is in the big mix of things is'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'generally considered a nice to have, but not essential. We don't like that answer, and I'm not advocating for it. But that's the reality in which we function on a day-to-day basis. So I think it might be a good thing. The Trust for the National Mall probably can't help. I don't know what their jurisdiction is. But I know the Trust for the National Mall was set up for this reason precisely, to try and tap into a different -- to a private income stream. So perhaps something like that should be explored if we want the cultural landscape reports before fiscal '26.'",

So seeing any project that has tree removal always kind of hits hard, but this one hits a little bit different because we're talking about a lot of these cherry blossoms. So when we're looking at doing any tree replacement, I saw that we said, okay, we're going to replace it one for one, or with something compatible. But these aren't just any trees. Like of all the projects and any tree that's ever come down, these are probably some of the most culturally important in DC. And also when we're looking at tree replacement where we have to do it, hopefully we're planning ahead.

So just within the scope of this project outside of all the other studies that will be done, just this is one place where I think you can't value-engineer with replacing a bunch of cherry trees with something else. I mean, I want to make sure there's a good plan in place going forward so that we save as many of them as we can and we replace as many of them as we can. I don't know if we have to get arborists involved or Forest Service or what. But these are not just any trees. So but again, always have to go to bat for them, so thanks.'",

A project that I think other members have talked about today fits within the reality of funding available to the National Park Service in the short-term while they develop a long-term plan that could be supported either by, you know, congressional appropriation or, as suggested by Commissioner Wright, by private donations. But that's something that's going to take time to work and we'll hope that Commissioner Stidham and her team will continue to work with the Corps of Engineers to really address this issue of flooding control at the two bridges. And I support Commissioner Cash's comments about preserving trees. That's important, and I hope the bat he's going to use is made of aluminum and not of'",

It's been very good working with the staff to move this project along, and we appreciate that. Also appreciate the attention and coordination of this project by the FDR Committee and their comments, both during the process and as we're moving through it. And in the future as we move this project forward. I do want to hit a couple points. First the trees. You know, being the Park Service, we are also, you know, the last thing we want to do is remove trees. Frankly, these trees have sat in so much water for such a long period of time, they're not in great condition, a lot of them.

You know, the ideal approach would have been that we had a huge pot of money and were able to not only design for replacement of the wall in this one section, but move the entire thing forward. You know, that is the most desirable point. But keeping in mind and along the lines of Commissioner Wright, this one portion is, you know, a $112 million project. And if you take that around the entire Tidal Basin, you can only imagine the overall cost. It's'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': 'not that we have not paid attention to the need or don't feel it's valuable, but those areas will be next. And as we move it to the Tidal Basin comprehensive plan, which should be awarded any day now, that is our basis. We've built a foundation that can be used for the wall of the -- the rest of the Tidal Basin wall, which has not sunk as much as the areas that we're looking at now. Those were a priority because of the fact that they were under water all day long. And if we continue to allow that to happen, the resource would currently -- would degrade even more than it already had. So very important to get those pieces before they were completely lost and unable to be put back in place. So that is what the driver was for focusing our attention on that. We'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': 'are very excited about starting the comprehensive plan. This will take a look at what the effects are of incorporating this design in the rest of the seawall and how that would be -- and how the adjacent areas would be tied in. That is a big undertaking in itself. If you're thinking about tying into the base of the FDR Memorial, that is on the one side of the Tidal Basin, tying in to MLK. And then the area over by the swan boats. So that's a lot, and we will be doing that as part of our comprehensive plan, which we will be coming back to the Commission for review, both at concept, on comment, preliminary, and final. So there is plenty more to talk about in terms of the Tidal Basin. And it will be a very public process where we engage stakeholders, and looking at concepts'",

We do appreciate that. I just want to say that, you know, this is a micro project that has funding that needs to go forward, as Commissioner Wright said. And you know, these collapsing walls need to be restored as part of the cultural landscape. But also, they're going to help to - -they'll contribute -- the experience we have here and the improvements we're making will contribute to hopefully the comprehensive plan that has been referred to and which comes next.

        "'MS. FREE': 'Great. Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon, Chair Goodmann and Commissioners. The National Park Service submitted revised final site development plans for the National Desert Shield and Desert Storm Memorial, located in Washington, DC. Overall, staff finds the proposed revisions do not significantly alter the approved memorial design or create any new impacts, and we are recommending that the Commission approves the revised plans. As a reminder, the memorial will be located near the intersection of Constitution Avenue and 23rd Street, NW, just to the north of the Lincoln Memorial, outside of the reserve. The Commission approved the memorial's final site development plans in December 2022. Today's review is focused on a few refinements to the plans that were developed following the project's final approval. In the following slides, I will first provide a brief overview of the project for reference, followed by a review of the proposed updates.'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'The design of the memorial is intended to evoke a desert landscape where the war was primarily fought. The commemorative space is enclosed by two berms that are reminiscent of sand dunes and retained by low walls that serve as a canvas for the commemorative elements. A water feature creates an oasis- like space in center of the memorial, and interior plant beds or mini-dunes are planted to further evoke the desert-like landscape and provide seating. A clockwise circulation pattern serves as the primary organizer for the memorial's three commemorative elements: the storm wall, the inscription wall, and the unity shield, which represents service in the conflict, service and sacrifice, and service of the coalition, respectively. The clockwise pattern also recalls the successful left hook approach used by the U.S.-led armed forces to liberate Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. The current application proposes four updates,'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'which include pedestrian safety improvements at the intersection of 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue, a bioretention facility, refinements to the planting pallet, and the location of a flagpole. Pedestrian safety improvements are proposed as a visual deterrent to potentially errant high speed vehicles at the intersection of Constitution Avenue and 23rd Street. Four stainless steel bollards would be located approximately eight to ten feet behind the curb and spaced about six feet apart. Two stone seat walls are also proposed in alignment with the inner edge of the north and east street tree wells. And the stone used for the seat walls will be gallo antico granite, which is the same granite that is being used throughout the memorial. And staff finds that the proposed pedestrian safety improvements are complementary to the memorial and the surrounding streetscape. In addition, the area immediately opposite of the memorial on the east side'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'of 23rd Street is the Applicant's preferred site for the Global War on Terrorism Memorial. Therefore, staff recommends that if the NPS and U.S. Park Police determine that pedestrian safety improvement are necessary on the east corner of the 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue intersection in the future, that those improvements should be complementary to the current proposal. With regard to stormwater management, staff notes the originally approved design intended to capture and reuse rainwater to irrigate the memorial's planted areas. The revised design proposes to treat stormwater via bioretention facility and use potable water for irrigation. And staff encourages limited use of the proposed irrigation system after the plantings are established to reduce potable water use. NPS indicated that the bioretention area allows for a more efficient, cost-effective, and maintenance-friendly stormwater management system. The bioretention basin is designed to provide a seamless visual transition between the adjacent lawn and'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'recreation areas and the carex plantings that are proposed on the southwest berm. The planting pallet is updated to include diversified tree species in a simplified pallet of interior mini-dune plantings. The mini-dune plants are intended to evoke the character of the desert oasis and uses pollinator-friendly species, including milkweed, in response to the Commission's comments. While refined, t he planting pallet maintains the importance of the transition through three color zones, dark, white, and yellow, conceptually representative of the storm, the sacrifice, and the liberation experiences of the Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations. And lastly, a 25-foot height flagpole is proposed near the main entrance to the memorial on 23rd Street, in alignment with the street trees. The flagpole will serve to reinforce the historic integrity of the memorial site and its relationship to other war memorials in the vicinity. And overall staff supports incorporating a flagpole on'",

And that we were the only ones that struggle with funding and timing. This work that you're going to see here or that you've seen in the presentation, we're getting into more of the minute details. And with the hopes of obtaining our construction permit. And the further hopes of, when it comes to timing, commencing construction by the end of this year is what our goal is.

That input has been listened to, it's been applied to what the end product is going to be reflective of, and I thank you for that. I would also be very remiss if I did not thank the Commission for the support. Over five years now, five years ago during the site selection process, the Commission ran counter to what the Commission of Fine Arts took a stand on in terms of our location.

It's actually, just to make sure we have it straight on the record, it's the Desert Shield and Desert Storm Memorial is of course the official name. And that last thing I would say is that some of the commemorative elements of course one of those, a major one, are the raptors, the birds of prey. And it's still my goal that Commissioner Wright is going to become a raving fan of those birds, the eagle and the falcon, by the time we get to the end'",

The submission also identifies the submission's -- the species of plants that the National Park Service plans to install in the project. This is not what you want to do if you want to save pollinators. And I discussed the federal national strategy in 2015, which said it should increase monarch butterfly populations and other pollinator populations. I won't go into this again because you support this kind of thing. However, many of the proposed plans do not conform to the national strategy. These include grasses and sedges, which are a tremendous number of these. Grasses, most of the project is grass. Grass and sedges are well -- are wind pollinators. They do not produce nectar, which attracts and feeds adult'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'pollinators. Grass and sedges do provide nesting habitat for, and food for pollinator larvae, only the larvae. However, they do not benefit pollinators as much as flowering nectar plants do. Nectar plants also provide the nesting habitat shelter. In addition, however, butterflies, moths, hummingbirds, and many flies feed on nectar but not on pollen. The Forest Service needs to replace all -- most or all grasses and sedges with nectar plants. Non-native plants. Some of the plants are not native to the Mid-Atlantic region. Native pollinators may not be able to feed on these plants. Some may eventually become invasive, even if they're not presently designated at this time. The Park Service has stated to me that some of the non-native plants have adapted to local natural areas. These plants are very dangerous. Like Japanese honeysuckle, they may take many years before they become so invasive that they cannot --they're'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'impossible to control. Cultivars. The Park Service plans to install several cultivars of native plants. However, many cultivars are sterile and do not feed pollinators. The Xerces Society has emphasized this. The Park Service should therefore replace cultivars with their native parents. I have sent to the NCPC and the Park Service a list of native nectar plants that grow in sandy areas and dunes in the Mid- Atlantic region. This comes from a reference from Virginia. These include common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, which I constantly say needs to be planted, which this U.S. Forest Service describes this as being nature's megafood for insects, and as being the most important food plant for monarch caterpillars. You need to plant a lot of it, not just other milkweeds. Please request, please recommend that the Park Service replace all sedges, cultivars, grasses, and non-native plants with native nectar plants that I have'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'identified in my messages. You could put a few sedges in, but not many. This will help achieve the national strategy's goal. The Park Service can also teach the memorial's visitors about these plants if they just install appropriate signage and tell them what's going on here. Because most people don't know this and obviously the Park Service hasn't learned that lesson yet.'",

But I think we have to do that because it's important to remember them. And also this is kind of a special one for me because one of my close classmates at the Air Force Academy was the commander of the fighter pilots who flew in this conflict. So he'd make, boom, and he was, yeah, he was in charge of fighter pilots there on the wing. Also, I had a chance to be a part of a team that put on the first parade to recognize this, working with a bunch of other folks in the city to get permits, etc., etc., etc. And my job was to coordinate the flier, planes that came in down Constitution Avenue. And it was quite interesting. These folks lined up out in the Atlantic'",

        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Thanks. I just have a suggestion that I think might actually save you a few dollars. Why -- these bollards just don't seem necessary. There's a lot of other memorials that don't have the bollards. I mean, I'm a pedestrian, I don't even drive, but I understand they mirror what's across the street at the U.S. Peace, but they just kind of seem unnecessary. I mean, I'm not completely opposed, but it's just one more maintenance element, one more thing to rust. They just don't seem integral or that much of a safety concern, considering all the other memorials in the area. But that's my only comment. I think everything else is great.'",

As is this entire design, so thank you. And again, we do appreciate Mr. Berne's comments. In fact, we took his comments from December 2022 and we actually switched out -- we removed nine plants per his comments. And we added milkweed as well. So while this is not a location that lends itself to more of a meadow-like aesthetic, we have taken some action to add things per his comments. So we appreciate that very much.'",

Thank you for your work on this important memorial. And I'm very excited that it's moving forward. And I also want to thank Mr. Berne, because he's persistent. And I think it's important to understand his commitment as well to a biodiverse landscape that we can provide and the Park Service can advance whenever we have an opportunity to as the NCPC. And I just want to say that because the environmental benefit lasts as long as, you know, the memorial and has the power -- is a powerful statement to our commitment to addressing some of the challenges we're faced with right now in the climate arena.

    "7. ZONING COMISSION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ON TEXT AMENDMENTS FOR RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE": [
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'Agenda Item 7D is to approve a report to the Zoning Commission of the District of Columbia on text amendments for rules of practice and procedure. Mr. Flis is going to make a presentation on this. Mr. Flis, please.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Yes, thank you and good afternoon, Commissioners. Hopefully you can see my screen. So again, as mentioned, the NCPC has received a referral for a text amendment from the Zoning Commission of the District of Columbia. This is Case No. 22-25. So just as some background and as a reminder, NCPC receives referrals for text and map amendments from the District of Columbia Zoning Commission and reviews those and provides in an advisory capacity. The focus of these reviews is on whether the amendments will have an impact on federal interests. In most cases, zoning and map amendments do not have federal issues and therefore are delegated actions of the Executive Director. The Zoning Commission has approval authority for changes to the zoning regulations. Generally they take a final action immediately after receiving NCPC comments. So in this instance the referred zoning case includes two components, one part, one component'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'are changes to the Zoning Commission and Board of Zoning Adjustment rules and procedures, and these are included in Subtitles X,Y, and Z. NCPC does not review these changes. I'll note that public comments, some public comments you will hear today are focused on these procedural changes, which again, are not under NCPC's purview. The other component of the amendments are changes to Subtitles C and I, and which NCPC does review. So here you can see on the screen are the proposed amendments to Subtitle C and I. These include updates to citations, which are bolded and underlined here. Essentially they are minor, primarily to the change the numbering, the numbering convention for these certain citations. There's also another clarification in Subtitle I, which again is a correction to a citation. These changes do not impact NCPC or the federal interest. As such, the Executive Director's Recommendation is to'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'find that there are no impacts to the federal interest resulting from these amendments. As I mentioned, the other revisions that are not subject to NCPC review have also been reviewed by staff, and even so, they will not impact or alter NCPC's review process, including the review of Planned Unit Developments, which are also received as referrals from Zoning Commission. NCPC will still have the ability to review these projects as referrals for understanding the impacts to the federal interest, which includes impacts to adjacent federal land or the Height Act, for example. Generally NCPC does not delve into design details of these projects, which happens through the Zoning Commission local process, and quite often evolve as a result of that public process. And so that concludes my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Mr. Flis, for that report. And I want to ask if any commissioners have questions for Mr. Flis before we move on to the two individuals how have testimony today. Any questions for Mr. Flis? Hearing none, we will move on. The two people who have signed  up, we'll begin with Mr. DelleDonne, who is representing Dupont East Civic Action Association, and you would have five minutes, please, Mr. DelleDonne, to present to us. Thank you.'",
        "'MR. DELLEDONNE': 'Thank you for this opportunity to address the National Capital Planning Commission on Zoning Commission Case 22-25. My name is Nick DelleDonne, and I am the President of Dupont East Civic Action Association, which is dedicated to community engagement and civic action. The Mayor's Office of Planning has proposed rules that remove opportunities for community participation. Furthermore, they permit the Zoning Commission to make changes in already approved agreements between developers and the community without a hearing. These two aspects of the rules are alarming and need to be protested. I'm going to refer particularly to Rule Subtitle Z, Section 7036, which Mr. Flis did not review. It would allow the Zoning Commission to make changes in, quote, Proffered public benefits and amenities, required covenants, or approve additional relief and flexibility from the zoning regulations without a hearing. So that's the nub of our complaint. And I would suggest that'",
        "'MR. DELLEDONNE': 'if it is possible, when you're looking for a reference to the federal interest in your jurisdictional concerns, if it is possible for the Zoning Commission to avoid public comment on an agreement that's already been reached, it is possible for them to avoid Commission review, this commission's review. So it is important for you to take an interest in this matter and see whether or not in fact you're being effective in the interest of, you know, the community. So there it is in a nub. I'm going to mention one thing, is that the rules also put too much emphasis on digital communication. We are living in a digital divide. It is shocking, stunning how fast the technology has advanced. It is leaving half of the population behind. Many people feel frustration, not just me, with the new technology. And they avoid it, they are self-isolated. They are'",
        "'MR. DELLEDONNE': 'not available to notice through emails. And so it is a mistake to think that if you put out an email, you'll be reaching the people in the population that may require it. So those two things are all my comment, and I appreciate that opportunity today to say it. I hope you will take an interest in this matter.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much, Mr. DelleDonne. Thank you for your testimony. Then I would like to also see if there are any questions from the Commissioners for Mr. DelleDonne. Any questions? Hearing none, we'll move to our second guest today, and that is Ms. Richards, and you're representing the Committee of 100. And you will have five minutes for your testimony as well. So whenever you're ready, please begin.'",
        "'MS. RICHARDS': 'Thank you very much and I will not need the entire five minutes. The Committee of 100, as Mr. DelleDonne has stated, is likewise concerned with the provision allowing for the PUDs to be amended without notice, and although that is procedural in nature, it is substantive in effect. This means that any PUD that's in or around an area, a neighborhood in which you do have an interest -- I'm thinking of places like the Capital Interest District, the Naval Observatory District, and similar areas. Development in those areas could be amended substantially after the PUD order is approved. They could be changed in a way that affects elements on which you may have commented, and you will be foreclosed from further weighing in. That is the federal interest impact of these apparently procedural rules. So the other -- let's see -- as to Subtitle C, Subtitle C has'",
        "'MS. RICHARDS': 'some amendments that affect the inclusionary zoning provisions. They're very complex. They have been through a couple of iterations since OP first proposed these in April of 2023. These are lately come amendments. The rulemaking itself has been pending or about a couple of years now. The changes to Subtitle C refer to amendments to a section that is not in the existing rule. There's apparently missing interim draft of the rules, and so if you sort of say, okay, we're okay with the Subtitle C changes, you don't really know what you're signing off on. The draft before you says we're going to make some changes to Section 1001.2(a)(1), but there is no existing such rule. The rule, as it stands, is simply 1001.2(a). Apparently, a \"1\" was added later --well -- and then OP now proposes to amend it, but that interim vision has never come before the'",
        "'MS. RICHARDS': 'public. So this is kind of -- you know, it's -- and I don't say -- it's not just a clerical flaw, but it's more, in this case, than a renumbering. It's a change that you cannot trace the impact of. I certainly agree with you on Subtitle I. That is plainly a typographical error that was corrected. No problem there. As a general matter, even though your deference for home rule leads you to not take a hand or give voice to strictly procedural matters, we would think you would be concerned, and should express it, at the entire rules packet. There's been a lot of public dismay at recent congressional actions that chip away at our limited home rule powers. But this particular case, the Zoning Commission, our local body, is saying, okay, we're going to be anti-democratic and further restrict your right to participate. And I think'",
        "'MS. RICHARDS': 'that's something that NCPC properly can make a statement about. You can express an advisory view that this is not a good idea. So for that reason and for the drafting law in Subtitle C, and for the really overriding concern we have about the impact of Subtitle X on PUD amendments, we hope that you will weigh in and not simply approve this. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Ms. Richards. Thank you for your comments and your testimony. Are there any questions from Commissioners for Ms. Richards? Any questions? Hearing none, we will then open up --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Madam Chair?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes. I'm sorry. Commissioner Dixon, yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'First, always good to see Ms. Richards back in play. She's been a soldier in this area for many years and working with Committee of 100 in many other ways and Mr. DelleDonne, also aware of his work. I am also concerned. Obviously, we all -- hope all are very pro home rule and realize we have to watch our lane in terms of our movement. But I do hope that the staff has looked at and will consider some of the issues that have been raised, because it sounds like there is some concern that it does have some --could potentially have some federal impact on us, and we might not know it. So I don't want to speak out in any way in opposition to DC having its control over what it controls, but I think we should be very, very thoughtful about at least offering a view'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': 'that there is some potential areas where we could be involved improperly --'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' -- especially the staff concern that we don't ignore these comments. And I'd also maybe just like to ask of those that were presented by these two witnesses, which ones do we feel are not in our authority clearly, and which ones may be grayer?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' So your question is not for Ms. Richards, it's from staff, is that what I hear you say, for --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Yes. I think --'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' -- Ms. Sullivan or Mr. Flis?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I'm actually offering some -- hopefully some follow-up to what the two of them have presented and just trying to --'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Sure. I can respond to that in two ways. First of all, staff did look at the entire package of proposed amendments, and we did read through the entire document to just confirm that there were no impacts to the federal interest and that was the case. Secondly, regarding some of these other components, we did look at Ms. Richards' comments about some -- there was some not full clarity in terms of the citations. That was actually updated in further Zoning Commission documentation. So I will provide to her some of that documentation that actually came later than she referenced in her letters. The other thing I would offer is that because this is a process through the Office of Zoning, I would be happy to work with both of them to make sure that their comments about the public process, which is not NCPC's purview -- that's the'",
        "'MR. FLIS': 'Zoning Commission's purview -- to help make sure that their comments are transmitted to the Office of Zoning, because the Zoning Commission will ultimately take this up probably later this month or early next month at some point. I don't think that date's been finalized at that point but certainly can make that connection between their staff and the public speakers today.'",
        "'MS. RICHARDS': ' Thank you, Mr. Flis.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' NCPC has someone who serves on these bodies? That's a question.'",
        "'MR. FLIS': ' NCPC does not have a representative on the Zoning Commission.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' There is a designated representative on the Board of Zoning Adjustment --'",
        "'MS. RICHARDS': ' Right. That's correct.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' -- not on the Zoning Commission itself. It is the cross-jurisdictional review of changes to the zoning regulations that we're experiencing now, and that would go back to the Zoning Commission for their consideration. I appreciate Mr. Flis's suggestion to connect those comments back to the Zoning Commission. That process is still underway, and the Commission could consider those at that time. They have had a public hearing. They've had, actually, two notices of public hearing where they've taken comments and responded. We issued a public hearing so it's -- you know, the democratic process, as being described, is very robust and very much play.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I'm glad hear that emphasis. I notice Ms. Richards was going to comment. Can we hear what she wanted to say or was it -- may I ask that, Madam Chair? in to'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Of course.'",
        "'MS. RICHARDS': ' I was simply acknowledging Mr. Flis's offer of assistance which is, you know, very good to know and have -- and of course, Mr. Dixon, it's always good to see you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Ms. Richards. Thank you very much and thank you, Mr. Flis for those clarifying points. Are there any additional questions for staff or for any of our guests who are providing testimony today? Hearing no further questions, then we will turn to the Commission for discussion. If you could turn on your cameras and your mics, please? There is a motion to approve a report to the Zoning Commission of the District of Columbia on Text Amendments for Rules of Practice and Procedure. That is the proposed motion. Would someone make that motion?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': ' So move.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. It's been moved by Commissioner Steingasser. Is there a second?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Second.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' There's a second by Commissioner Argo. Thank you. So now we can begin discussion. We're going to begin with Commissioner Steingasser for your comments, please?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': 'Thank you. I'd just like to point out some clarification. Speaking zoning is its own little language, you know, full of nuance, and it's knee-deep in cross-references. There is no change to the referrals of any zoning action or project to NCPC. All of those referrals will stay in place. Anything that was referred before the change to these regulations will continue to be referred. There is a change in the nomenclature. The current regulations now have two types of modifications, one of consequence, which is a modification that has no public hearing and a modification of significance, which is a modification that requires a hearing. There is a lot of confusion over the last two years of how those two interact. And as part of that effort to clarify, the Zoning Commission has proposed to have either a modification with the hearing or a modification without a hearing. And'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STEINGASSER': 'those two -- that is the bulk of the change, and there's a lot of confusion out there about how that change in nomenclature and reference might actually result in a change in public notice. But there is -- there will be no change in the public process. Those that have hearings are still defined and will still have a hearing with full notification. I just wanted to try to clarify that. And the references to Subtitle C, I'm not quite sure what timing was being referenced, because as Matthew pointed out, those changes have been updated, and those numbers are correct, as advertised, both on the Office of Zoning website and the Office of Documents.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Thank you very much, Commissioner Steingasser. Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thank you. I really have no comments, I think, at this time so appreciate the offer.'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Thanks. I just wanted to kind of add from a process perspective. With the idea of moving some more of the electronic and the digital guide, I'll just say that even us as a Commission, I think over the last three years, moving that electronic, while it does have some of its downfalls, it's actually, in many ways, increased participation. We see the same thing on the DC Council. We've had an all electronic testimony submission portal now for the last six months, and we've actually gotten an uptick in engagement. So it does definitely cut both ways. I'm actually kind of amazed at it. Sometimes we've had people literally on their phone in a tent encampment providing testimony on homeless services. So I mean it has been a tool to be a little bit more robust. And just on the process as well, I just wanted to mention with'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'the attorneys that worked on this stuff, so OP, they put these recommendations forward usually, but the Office of Zoning actually has its own six independent attorneys that work for them. So it's not like these are just kind of being rammed through. So I have confidence that there is a process that was followed well. There's been an opportunity for hearings. So while I appreciate the concerns, I would defer to the rulemaking.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Before you close, I want to make -- be clear, technology has been my life in many ways, lots of ways. But I do believe that we need to be thoughtful about who we are. We may be broadening participation. I accept that but we also --there are certain people we are not including that are being -- and so being cautious about the population, how we are skewing it. I think it is a concern and I'm not sure how we deal with it, but I think we need maybe more -- we get more or less from other participants than --maybe it's an age issue. I don't know but anyway.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'Thank you, Commissioner Dixon, and I can echo that. I think we -- in this period of transition in history, we're going to have to err very significantly on both sides to make sure we accommodate people both -- on both sides of the digital divide, because I know in our community back in Iowa, we have the exact same challenge. While it has expanded access for many people, and that's been tremendous, there are people who are lost. So we'll continue to work along both sides of this divide but thank you for your comments. And I just, again, want to thank everyone who's commented today, and it's my understanding that NCPC does not have authority over these issues. That's my understanding. And so we do appreciate your comments, and we highly recommend, you know, moving back and directly to the District Office of Zoning and the Zoning Commission'",

        "'PARTICIPANT': ' Yes. MS. Mc'",
        "'CREHAN': 'Thank you. Well, good afternoon. Yes. I am very excited to be here today to share updates about the Beyond Granite initiative and its pilot exhibition titled, \"Pulling Together,\" which is currently on display on the National Mall. Teresa Durkin, Executive Vice President at the Trust for the National Mall, our partner and the leader on this effort, is also available for questions at the conclusion of the presentation. We'll focus today mainly on the current exhibition and some of our next steps, but I'll begin with a brief general overview since this has come to the Commission previously. So as a reminder, the project origins are, in part, to NCPC's efforts over the past two decades. NCPC has worked jointly with federal partners on several initiatives related to memorials and monuments including the Memorials and Museums Master Plan, the Memorial Trends and Practice Report, and the Memorials for the'",
        "'CREHAN': 'Future Competition in 2016. These reports provided recommendations to address various issues in the monumental landscape and specifically to encourage the use of temporary artworks as a complement to permanent commemoration addressing both land space issues on the National Mall as well as the option for more storytelling. The Trust for the National Mall, with National Capital Planning Commission, and National Park Service support, submitted a grant proposal to the Mellon Foundation in 2021 to support the idea of testing temporary artworks in this pilot exhibition, and that grant was awarded in the fall of 2021. So through the grant, the project partners developed Beyond Granite, which is a dynamic new series of installations designed to create a more inclusive, equitable, and representative process for storytelling on the National Mall. Generation-defining moments have been commemorated here: The NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and America Remembers COVID Memorial and the projection'",
        "'CREHAN': 'of the Apollo XI launch on the Washington Monument to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Beyond Granite seeks to build on the legacy of those exhibits which can demonstrate that the National Mall and surrounding areas can be an extraordinary platform for creating powerful and lasting memories even and especially for artworks that last a shorter period of time. So Beyond Granite is creating a new format. Again, this complements museums, permanent memorials in addition to the opportunities for First Amendment demonstrations, marches, protests, and events. So this pilot year is exploring how new models can create these experiences and lasting memories using a wide array of non- permanent structures. So it's equally a moment of learning for us. To help us do that, we have Dr. Elizabeth Morton, who's a professor right now at George Washington University, who's conducting and leading the evaluation of the pilot project. I'll get back'",
        "'CREHAN': 'to her works towards the end of the presentation, but we're evaluating from these two main lenses, which are the Trust and NCPC's, the overarching vision, of course, being to address the demands to tell stories in this prominent space is very high, and there's simply not enough room for everyone's story to be shared in a permanent way. For NCPC, we're learning how the exhibition could inform our policies and practices around commemoration, including the viability of this option and other learnings about the process. And for the Trust, this is about a proof of concept test, establishing a long-term program. This directly aligns with the Trust's mission to restore, preserve, and enrich the National Mall as the leading nonprofit partner of the National Park Service. As you are aware, at this point, this is a partnership project between the Trust for the National Mall, led by the Trust'",
        "'CREHAN': 'for the National Mall, and NCPC and NPS are partners on the project. NCPC and NPS have come with similar goals, again, protecting the open space on the National Mall while providing new opportunities. The project, of course, is funded by Mellon's Foundation Monument Project. We're very grateful to have the opportunity for this idea that's been decades in the making and making it a reality. Monument Lab has provided their expertise in curating and bringing this pilot exhibition to life, and we've brought on community engagement and evaluation consultants to help research and understand the larger aspects of this program and how to effectively create it including D.C. residents, subject matter experts and memorial sponsor perspectives. So this pilot exhibition is exploring a curated exhibition to test that potential. This is just one experiment, one approach to doing this, but we've been thrilled thus far to see the positive'",
        "'CREHAN': 'reception on the Mall. The curatorial question each of the six invited artists have responded to is what stories remain untold on the National Mall. So the pilot, \"Pulling Together,\" illustrates one approach, one set of under-represented stories. This sets the stage for an ongoing program that can elevate these untold stories and the possibilities are truly limitless. What we learned from Pulling Together will help inform how Beyond Granite evolves as a lasting program and shapes the capital's commemorative landscape with a model that can be replicated nationwide. So here we are today in the middle of the exhibition which is currently up at locations including Lincoln Memorial Plaza, Constitution Gardens, the grounds of the Washington Monument, and near the Smithsonian Metro Station. Our co-curators for the project pilot exhibition are Paul Farber and Salamishah Tillet. We're really grateful for their insights and leadership to make this exhibition successful.'",
        "'CREHAN': 'There's more information on the process for selecting artists and curating the program. I'd encourage everyone to look at the Beyond Granite website, which is www.beyondgranite.org. The exhibition itself is inspired by Marian Anderson's 1939 Easter Sunday performance. She's a renowned Black opera singer who performed on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial after she was refused to perform inside due to segregation and performed on the Lincoln steps to a crowd of 75,000 integrated people. Her performance remains monumental in public memory, with educator and civil rights activist, Mary McLeod Bethune, who remarked on her performance that it was a -- told a story of hope for tomorrow, a story of triumph, and a story of pulling together. And that's where our exhibit title comes from. So the exhibition and its interpretation activities aim to provide new perspectives to the National Mall, inform monument policy and again, serve as'",
        "'CREHAN': 'this pilot. The featured artist are Derrick Adams, Tiffany Chung, Ashon Crawley, vanessa german, Paul Ramirez Jonas, and Wendy Red Star. They've all built artworks for the National Mall that respond to that central curatorial question. Surrounding their installations are the welcome stations in the blue dots, and those are staffed by local D.C. residents, artists, educators, interested folks who are helping interpret and orient visitor, and encouraging conversations and new perspectives around these topics. So I'd like to share a few photos taken from the past few weeks from the exhibition. We're getting some preliminary numbers from Park Service right now that there have been about 750,000 visitors that were on the National Mall during August 2023. So we've potentially had quite a few eyes on this project. So here's one of those welcome stations in action. These are open from 12:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. daily. This week'",
        "'CREHAN': 'we've been conscious of the heat advisory, so they will reopen again tomorrow through the rest of the exhibition, hopefully. We have an exhibition guide that provides information and context for the exhibit by the curators. This includes articles by the partners, information about the artist, artworks, and more. So be sure to pick one of those up at a welcome station. This is Derrick Adams' work, \"America's Playground: DC\" at Constitution Gardens Plaza, and this was referenced at the earlier Constitution Gardens presentation today. Tiffany Chung's work titled, \"For the Living,\" with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in the background. This is Ashon Crawley's \"Homegoing\" which is sited on the south side of the Washington Monument. This is an audiovisual memorial to black queer artists impacted by the AIDS epidemic. \"Let Freedom Ring,\" which is near the Smithsonian Metro Station and my virtual background. And Wendy Red Star's thumbprint titled,'",
        "'CREHAN': '\"The Soil You See,\" which is on Signers Island, again, in Constitution Gardens. Now the artists were also asked to activate their installation, some of which has already happened, the background in gray there, but some is occurring this weekend. So I really encourage everyone to register, attend the mapping workshop Saturday morning or the concert on Saturday evening. This is the post exhibition artworks plan. We have a couple of the pieces that have been purchased and are being relocated, a few others we're thinking about how they will travel or move or other opportunities for location, and some of them may have donated materials or recycled materials as that's appropriate. So in terms of other things happening on the ground during the exhibition, I mentioned the goals for the lead partners and that we're looking at this pilot demonstration as a tool to learn about the impact and'",
        "'CREHAN': 'potential temporary artwork. So as part of that work, Dr. Elizabeth Morton, who's on the far right in that image, has a team that are conducting live audience engagement surveys on the Mall throughout the exhibition to help answer questions and get public feedback on this first exhibition. The goal is about 100 responses per artwork, which is a general rule of thumb indicator for significance, and they are out at various times during the exhibition outside of the welcome station window to try to get some variation. They have about 90 percent response rate right now which, if you've conducted surveys, is extremely high. We're very excited we're getting a lot of great feedback, and people are willing to complete the survey. So the survey questions are geared toward understanding, again, what conditions temporary artworks or it doesn't. So these -- there are some questions designed around learning about'",
        "'CREHAN': 'location, what about the placement of the artworks is successful or not. Anecdotal information like to question number 5, \"Does the fact that this artwork is located on the National Mall affect your impressions of the artwork?\" People are saying \"yes.\" And we feel that's a positive response. Again, thinking about the condition for this work, we wanted to learn about public experiences. So again, \"Would you be likely to plan a visit to a future exhibition?\" We've been hearing \"yes.\" Of course, we are still gathering surveys. This, you know, general information could change but I wanted to share some of those insights since we have them early. So the survey work, among other additional research, will culminate in a key findings report to provide these lessons learned and understanding of the pilot. Dr. Morton has also already conducted a survey with memorial sponsors earlier this year that will'",
        "'CREHAN': 'be included in that report as well as interviews with project members in earnest. The report will be completed later this year, early next year, and we'll come back to the Commission with those findings and our next steps. That concludes the presentation today with a reminder there are still 11 days to head to the Mall and visit the exhibition. And to the Commissioners, we'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning for a tour. I appreciate your time today. Happy to answer any questions at this point and just a reminder, I do have Teresa Durkin from the Trust for the National Mall online as well to answer any questions.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Well, thank you so much, Johanna McCrehan. Thank you very much for all the work you've done on this great presentation. We also want to thank Teresa and Catherine, our partners for the Trust for the National Mall and the National Park Service, and Director Sams also attended that opening reception and all the staff at the Park Service that have helped make this project a reality. We just are so grateful for their partnership. That's a great example of what partnership can do. Do any Commissioners have questions right now for Ms. McCrehan or for Teresa from the Trust for the National Mall?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Madam Chair?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes, sir.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' I just want to -- I think it was kind of interesting that we just got finished talking about the divide, the digital divide, and here we have this kind of a bridge, in some ways, between certain populations and others with the artwork that's being presented. So I think it's a good thing. I would like to hear from the other person to see what her comments on the project might be. Is she still here? I don't think we heard from here from the --'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' I believe -- is Teresa still here?'",

        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Yes.'",
        "'MS. DURKIN': 'Yes. From the Trust perspective, we're just absolutely delighted with the outcome. It's been a lot of hard work, almost 200 people have been working on this project, and we are tremendously grateful that Marcel Acosta invited us to be a partner in this adventure over 2-1/2 years. And the NCPC staff have just been so wonderful to work with. Johanna has been with us from the beginning, and Michael, and Julia, and Stephen, and so many of you have just lived through this with us. But when you're out there and you're just observing families and people who come up upon the art installations, they're so surprised and delighted by what they see, and it is having such a positive impact on people's experience already. And this was just a pilot. You know, it's not -- there's probably 100 other ways to do this, and we're going to be'",
        "'MS. DURKIN': 'continuing to explore that as well learn from evaluation report and Dr. Morton is working what we've observed on the ground. Can we really make this a sustainable program? We think this is just the beginning and just looking forward to doing more of this work in the future.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' You know, I think first, two things. One, I'm glad you came on because we got a chance to see those beautiful sunflowers behind you. In my home in Virginia, there was a field -- a whole field of them. It's unbelievable.'",
        "'MS. DURKIN': ' Lucky you.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' A very huge field of them and see that you got a few in your background. The other thing, more than even -- I mean I think that many of you mentioned what you're doing and one is you're also bringing the community together --'",
        "'MS. DURKIN': ' We are.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' -- around on our public space which we all are trying to protect and to show that our backyard, which is our First Amendment place to express and show and shouldn't be cluttered, give -- so it leaves room for people to come together around art and around an argument, around just the freedom of speech issue. But I think it's very -- this is where people are coming together, community people talking to visitors and others through your -- so I think it's great, thank you, what you've done, thank you.'",
        "'MS. DURKIN': ' Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Teresa, and thank you for your partnership, and thank you, Commissioner Dixon for your questions and comments. So I will move now to the commission, and I'm going to begin -- I want to begin --well, Commissioner Dixon, you're first. Of course.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DAVIS': ' I think I yield the rest of my time.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Dixon. And Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' No other comments or questions but thanks for the presentation. It's an exciting project.'",

        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' No comments. Just looking forward to the walk-around tomorrow as long as the weather cooperates.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes, right. Bring some water. Right. Thank you. Commissioner Stidham.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' Thank you very much. You would think working for the Park Service I'd already seen this more than once but I haven't yet, so I'm looking forward to the tour tomorrow. It has been great. We've gotten a lot of wonderful press and a lot of support, so thank you again for the partnership. We really appreciate it.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Stidham. Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I can't wait to see this, and I'm very excited about it, excited about the work, excited about its potential for all kinds of things as an attraction on the Mall. And thanks for all the work that's gone into it.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Great. Thank you, Commissioner Argo. And Vice Chair Hewlett, you've joined us. Are you there? Uh-oh, did we lose her again?'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': ' We had her for a minute and then --'",
        "'PARTICIPANT': ' Then we didn't.'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': ' -- and then we didn't.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. All right. Well, we'll catch up with her when she returns. Commissioner Green?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': ' Thank you. This is really an exciting project, and I'm so happy to see this first phase of it. And not only for what it says about the Mall, the Mall could be and monuments could be, what it means nationally for other communities to develop the same thing. And this is really terrific, and I'm really -- maybe I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I'm really also looking forward to the next wave of exhibitions and looking forward to this continuing. This is really terrific and a fair amount of work.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes. Thank you so much, Commissioner Green. Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes. I have nothing more to add. I'm sorry I can't come tomorrow, but I'll get there when the weather cools off cause I haven't seen it either.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'Well, thank you Commissioner Wright. Thank you. I hope you're feeling better, too, soon. I had the, as I said, the pleasure of coming for the opening several weeks ago, and I have to say that the project is -- it's just exhilarating for all the reasons that have been mentioned, for the innovation that it demonstrates for all of us, you know, that we can have these under represented stories in our Nation's history told in this way, in an exciting way that captures the imagination of the public. Every time I talk about it, I get a cough. So I'm grateful and I'm going to take just a break. (Pause.) I am also grateful for the partnership that it represents and thankful to the staff and to the talented artists. So I'm going to close with that. This concludes our open session. Our next regular Commission meeting will'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'be held on Thursday, October 5th at 1:00 p.m. And if there's no further business, this session is adjourned.'"
