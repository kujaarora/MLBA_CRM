The US Department of the Navy has submitted a draft master plan for portions of the southeast corner of the Washington Navy Yard for Commission comment. The area subject to the master plan includes the O parcels and portions of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail and piers. The project area is about 15 acres. In the future, the Applicant will submit specific site and building development plans to NCPC for approval, consistent with the master plan. I will note, the Commissioner received an amended EDR from staff yesterday. The Commission's review of draft master plans focuses on topics such as program needs, proposed uses, sustainability strategies, and consistency with the comprehensive plan. Today, I will provide an overview of the draft plan for the O parcels, along with staff's recommendations for plan refinement for the next Commission'",

Here is a site map showing the location of the Washington Navy Yard located in Southeast Washington, DC, just north of the Anacostia River and across from the Anacostia Park. Zooming in, here is a closer view that shows the O parcels in the Southeast corner of the Navy Yard. The site includes a number of existing buildings, parking lots, and a parking garage. Several structures and buildings are considered historic. As part of the master plan, a mixed- use program of development is proposed including residential, retail, hospitality, and office spaces. The Navy has opted to pursue this master plan as a federal action, as the O parcels will remain federal land while leased to a private developer, and NCPC is exercising its review authority in lieu of zoning. The lease agreement between the Navy and the private developer is part of a larger transaction, which allows the'",

The master plan for the remainder of the Navy Yard will be submitted separately in the future. For the O parcels, some existing buildings will be repurposed and reused, while others may be demolished. Portions of the Washington Navy Yard are listed as a National Historic Landmark District. As I mentioned earlier, while the master plan area will be subject to a long-term lease to a private developer, the land will remain under federal ownership. The mixed-use development will be'",

Here are more images of some of the buildings and structures located in the O parcels, including historic buildings that will be rehabilitated for new uses in the master plan, as part of the mixed-use development. The Applicant also intends to reinterpret and reuse the historic pier footprints within the Anacostia River, to allow for public access. Now, let's discuss the Master Plan draft. Under the draft Master Plan, up to 1.7 million square feet of development is proposed. The Applicant defined four planning principles for the draft Master Plan, and they include increased public access to historic elements for the first time in'",

WEBB': 'over 100 years, while making the historic elements and their interpretation center to the design, provide an expansive waterfront experience that enhances the existing neighborhood, preserve and strengthen view sheds on Parson's Avenue and 10th Streets, and extend existing historic Navy Yard north south building orientations to the newly constructed buildings. The proposed mix of uses, including residential and retail, will bring new activity to this portion of the waterfront, replacing surface parking lots and low-scale buildings. The development will also include affordable housing, which is a significant need in the region. The private developer has also committed to rehabilitating several historic buildings, improving and maintaining portions of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, and providing public access to the historic Marine Railway area. The Navy evaluated design options with the Section 106 consulting parties beginning in 2019, to accommodate the proposed development program while balancing historic preservation considerations including visual impacts'",

Based on the discussion and evaluation during the Section 106 consultation process, the Applicant developed a preferred massing approach, which allows building heights up to 130 feet with the buildings stepped back away from the historic districts, to minimize visual impacts on historic resources. The proposed layout of the development has been configured in a way to minimize impacts on historic properties. The Master Plan includes three zones, as identified in the programmatic agreement. And they are the marine railway model basin zone, the waterfront zone, and the new construction zone. Design guidelines were developed in the programmatic agreement and will apply to each of the zones. Here is a rendering of the marine railway model basin zone, and this zone includes contributing and non-contributing buildings surrounding an inlet boat slip. In'",

WEBB': 'this zone, historic buildings and structures will be preserved and rehabilitated to the maximum extent possible, and hardscape and circulation improvements will be designed to maximize the preservation of existing original, or later historically significant fabric, and be compatible with the zone's historic context. Here is another rendering of the marine railway model basin zone, new retail and commercial uses are proposed in this zone. On this image, the building on the left is the current Navy Museum, which the developer intends to rehabilitate as a food hall. On the right of this rendering, you can see some of the proposed new massing and building heights in the O parcel. The waterfront zone extends along the north shore of the Anacostia River, from 11th Street on the east to the Southeast Federal Center boundary on the west. It includes piers one and two, which contribute to the Landmark District and'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail. The waterfront zone is intended for public circulation and recreational uses. This zone will include renovation of non-historic elements, such as the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, and the addition of new elements, such as marinas, recreational amenities, and in-water landscape features that will incorporate compatible contemporary design, with interpretation of the Washington Navy Yard's history. Finally, the new construction zone occupies the area north of the waterfront zone, and east of the marine railway model basin zone. This area includes contributing Building 166 and several non-contributing buildings, including a parking garage. The new development zone is expected to include modern residential, retail, and hospitality uses. New construction in this zone is expected to meet LEED Gold and Net Zero standards. Flooding and sea level rise has been taken into account by raising the building base elevations to 15 feet, based on the 500-year flood plan at approximately'",

In the new construction zone, the historic Building 166 shown in the images on the right will be incorporated in the new development with the northeast and west facades of the north wing retained and restored. Staff finds that the Navy's preferred massing concept balances the Applicant's programmatic needs for a new mixed-use development, with historic preservation considerations in the context of a National Historic Landmark District. In particular, the master plan integrates historic buildings for new uses in the development, minimizes the visual impact of the new development on the Historic District with the tallest buildings located away from the landmark area, maintains key L'Enfant plan corridors and view sheds, retains and enhances connections to the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, and addresses flooding and sea level rise through the siting and elevation of new structures.

WEBB': 'from the overlook in the final project submission for the Bridge Park, show views of the river, the Capitol Dome, the new Frederick Douglass Bridge, the Capitol Hill Neighborhood, as well as Anacostia to the south. Here is a current view towards the Capitol, which we believe approximates the potential view from the Capitol overlook on the proposed 11th Street Bridge Park. The proposed site plan and building massing, coordinated through the Section 106 consultation process, are based on the protection of the primary view corridors related to the L'Enfant streets identified in the Plan of the City of Washington National Register of Historic Places listing. The protected corridors include the North/South Streets, as shown here, which are 10th and Parsons. The views from the proposed Bridge Park overlook are not protected views in the National Register, nor the comprehensive plan. And it is possible that the new Navy Yard'",

However, staff believes additional coordination needs to occur. So, prior to the next review, staff recommends that the Commission require the Navy and private developer to work with the Building Bridges Across the River project team to identify the existing and proposed viewsheds from the 11th Street Bridge Park overlooks, and evaluate whether modifications to the master plan massing could accommodate sight lines to the U.S. Capitol Dome, the Washington Monument, or other landmarks without compromising the density or impacting historic resources and viewsheds, and develop a process for ongoing coordination between the two projects, from design, development through construction and implementation. Now, let's shift the discussion to other topics such as transportation, environment and sustainability, and affordable housing that should be addressed in'",

Which analyzed the impacts of the selected alternative on the local road network, including the private development on the O parcels and construction of a relocated museum on the E parcels. While some of the intersections near the Navy Yard are near failing under existing conditions, the development associated with the land exchange would not cause any of the intersections to reach failing conditions. The Navy determined the action would not result in significant impacts to traffic. The EIS included several mitigation measures that could be used to limit impacts to these intersections. And most of these are transportation demand management strategies for the Applicant to incorporate, as well as providing information on websites to encourage visitors to the sites to use routes that avoid the intersections of concern. The'",

The developer will build and maintain the streets, which will remain in federal ownership. Additional information regarding the typical streetscape sections, and material palette, will be necessary for the next review. Therefore, staff recommends that the Commission request the Applicant provide for the next submission typical street sections that show the dimensions, material palettes, and tree landscape plantings anticipated on O Street, 10th Street, and Parsons Avenue.

So, my name is Scott Kratz and I am the Director of the 11th Street Bridge Park with is a collaboration of the Ward 8 nonprofit, Building Bridges Across the River and the District Department of Transportation. And for the last ten years, we've engaged local residents and key stakeholders to transform an aged out freeway into a new civic space that will physically and metaphorically reconnect to long divided communities, monumental Washington and historic Anacostia. This project is immediately adjacent to the east of this proposed development that you have in front of you today. We thank NCPC for their unanimous approval of our final design and working with DDOT, we aim to solicit our general contractor and break ground in 2024. The park has been driven by over a thousand meetings with the community'",

KRATZ': 'that has created programming and selected the design team, and informed a series of housing, workforce, small business preservation, and arts and culture strategies to ensure that these tens of thousands of residents who shaped this new civic space can be the ones that benefit from it. And during this multi-year process, we listened carefully and intently and addressed stakeholder concerns through respectful dialogue, finding common ground, including with staff from the Navy Yard from the U.S. Navy, National Park Service, local residents, business owners, and faith communities. For instances, representatives from the boating community participating in our design competition expressed concerns about floating gardens in the river that would block access on the -- to them, the historic African American boathouses along the Anacostia and regular large regattas. We worked thoughtfully and patiently together to address these concerns while maintaining the 11th Street Bridge Park's environmental goals. As stated'",

KRATZ': 'earlier, one of the community requested programming areas for the 11th Street Bridge Park with views of the monumental corridor, specifically, views of the U.S. Capitol Building which can be seen from the top of the western-most truss of the Bridge Park. According to an NCPC document from last year in May of 2022, quote, one of the most important contributors to the capital city's image is its unmistakable and symbolic skyline and sweeping vistas in the monumental core. The views of Washington reveal a skyline punctuated not by commercial skyscrapers, but by architectural embellishments and civic symbols, end quote. We agree that these views for residents and tourists alike are critical to understanding and appreciating out national's capital. A few years ago, we commissioned a drone to take footage from the height of the soon to be constructed capital overlook which stands at 19.7 meters, or 64.6 feet, that'",

We thank NCPC staff for including in the recommendation today to require the Navy and private developer, prior to the next review, to work with Building Bridges Across the River project team and DDOT to identify the existing and proposed view sheds from the 11th Street Bridge Park Overlooks and evaluate modifications to the master plan massing to accommodate site lines of the U.S. Capitol Dome, the Washington Monument, and other landmarks as well as developing a process for ongoing coordination between the two projects from design development through construction and implementation.

And I would like to thank the National Capital Planning Commission for finding an amicable solution to the view shed issue raised by 11th Street Bridge Park. It's important to recognize that economic development and community development are not the same thing. And that community development makes our community a better place to live and work.

And it is my hope and wish that the Navy Yard master plan sets a new precedent for all future projects going forward for east of the river where the public policy reflects public input and economic development reflects a social responsibility to the communities in which they operate.

So, I was going to say, it's my best relationship with a developer in this city, but that's not saying much. So, I want to make sure I'm giving them the proper accolade. I think they've been a great community partner up to this point. I think that their willingness to work with 11th Bridge Park on this issue is proof of that. And so, I don't see it being any reflection or negatively on their outlook going forward. But again, I have not spoken with them specifically on this issue.

Moreover, I'm encouraged to know that the Navy identified Redbrick as its development partner. As someone who has seen Redbrick in action in the community, I'm confident that Mr. Skinner and his colleagues will be committed, and they are committed, to delivering great building and space, all the while working right beside people.

As a long-time resident, stakeholder, and now business owner of Ward 8, I consider the decision to build three 130-foot buildings along the adjacent corridors of the 11th Street Bridge selfish. It is obvious that residents would oppose this plan and that's why it was brought to our attention 72 hours before the time to decide. As we know, Ward 8 has been deemed as an underserved community where crime is high, individuals lack education, crises with health disparities, and many of the historic homes have become dilapidated.

The 11th Street Bridge project has provided leverage for small business owners like myself to showcase our ideas and inventions, an open market for travelers near and far to experience. We all are looking forward to networking in mid 2024 with residents east and west of the river. My opinion is that the three buildings would cause blocking of the Southwest and downtown views.

When staff was looking at the submission and looking at the public testimony, we realized that we didn't have enough information on what the views from the proposed overlook are under today's condition, nor did we have enough information on what the views would be with the proposed development. We are asking for the Navy and Redbrick to work with Building Bridges to share information on heights of the overlooks and all of that, drone images, so that we can understand that better and be able to evaluate it better.

And so, we really do try to make a concerted effort through those processes to be able to hear from the public on what we're trying to do. And we had a very public process through the environmental impact statement, looking at the environmental impacts of this land exchange and the follow on development that would occur if the land exchange moved forward.

We held two public meetings during this scoping period. We did have quite a bit more participation in those meetings than we get for a lot of our actions, which was great because that's exactly what we were looking for. We received 14 comments during those meetings and then, follow on emails and letters that we received.

We had information available on the project website that people could go and view to get more information about the project. We held two additional public meetings during this time in November of last year. Through that process, we received 79 comments, again, via email, mail, and in public comments during those two public meetings.

We posted notices in the Washington Post to let people know that it was available. There was additional information. We only received one letter, from the U.S. EPA based on the final EIS. And it was just in general support of the project and that their comments on the draft had been addressed.

And then, we will continue coordination with DDOT and the 11th Street Bridge Park and the protected bike lane project on 11th Street to ensure that this development can work seamlessly with all of those projects. So, I know -- I'll pause there.'",

This comes from a very long history with Navy Yard when I was still a reserve officer and now, I'm retired 06. I helped at the Navy to look for vendors. One of my assignments was attracting vendors into that facility when they first decided to place a more significant presence in that area. And we had some success, I hope a lot of success in doing that. But that's a long time ago. I do know the Navy. I really have a great deal of appreciation for the Navy bringing so much into one place. I mean, it's a densely populated, densely collection of the Navy's headquarters, major, major commands.

But again, it is a very major -- I mean, we have the entire major leadership of the Navy that has decided -- elected many years ago to come into our community on our side, Anacostia River Eastside, but at least on our river. And I think that's very important. And the link between Anacostia, east of the river Anacostia, R as they call it, Anacostia East, is significant because most of the people worked at the Navy Yard when they were making parts and they were actually'",

And also for -- with your amended report with -- to include the information that you put on the pages. I think it was 4 and 11 with regard to Building Bridges. And it's so important, and so, I'm thankful for that. And with the additional presentation today and testimony we've heard from Mr. Freeman, Captain Tobias, and Pastor Payne, and Ms. Monroe, and Mr. Moten, I think we have a process to move forward.

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. All right, so, I'm going to begin with Commissioner Cozart for deliberation.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to those who testified and to our presenters on behalf of the Navy. And certainly to our staff for preparing an excellent presentation. And my comments are that the master plan generally fits with the District's vision for this area as defined by comprehensive plan policy. Other than providing too little affordable housing, which I'll say a little bit more about and the view shed issue that's been referenced by the individuals who testified, the master plan is an important step in the right direction. I do want to take issue with the staff report characterization of the development program envisioned by the master plan as a solely federal project. To the contrary, with the exception of a shared parking garage, it is entirely private development containing no federal public buildings. And as a private development, it's subject to the District's zoning regulations.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'And the zoning regulations would dictate that this private development should provide up to 20 percent of the residential square footage as inclusionary units, not the 8 percent that are proffered in the master plan. And further, this development should go through the robust process that's public provided by the District's Zoning Commission. And that would be expected for a private development project of this magnitude, this size. For the past year, District agencies have been working very closely with the Navy and the developers to keep the master plan amendment going and moving forward and to develop proposed zoning consistent with the district regulations and a comprehensive plan. And I understand fully that today we're voting on the staff comments on the master plan and not the master plan itself. I'm largely supportive of the staff comments and the EDR and really thankful to the staff for their work'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': 'on this project. However, to the extent that the master plan purports to be a substitute for District zoning, I would be inclined to vote against the plan approval when it comes to the Commission in the future. And so, those are my comments. And thanks, again, to the staff.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you very much, Commissioner Cozart, for your input. Next, we will hear from Commissioner McMahon, please? (NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE)'",

        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thank you, Chair Goodmann, and again, thanks to, critically, the NCPC staff for their detailed report recommendations and I think especially their pivot over the last two to three days to reflect on some of the issues that have come to light as this final report which I'm looking at kind of falls along with what was originally published in the EIS. And we've talked about the problems with communications with that and how it discussed the use of the property. That being said, I think that the modifications that the Executive Director has recommended to reflect on those issues of the 11th Street Bridge are critical and important to moving forward with the project. And so, I'll be supporting the motion to approve the staff comments on the EDR as we move forward. That's all I've got. Thank you.'",

This is a project that the Park Service has also been following for some time due to its relationship with JBAB over on the other side of the river. So, we appreciate this project coming forward. And being in NHL, also, we have participated widely in the Section 106 process and appear that has come to a good place. I, too, would encourage additional coordination with the 11th Street Bridge Project, as that has been ongoing for so very long and offers a lot of opportunities for the community as a whole. And I really think that's it. I appreciate the work that has been done and look forward to seeing more from this project.'",

Does -- can we hear the Navy say as to what -- my understanding was that the Navy had a pretty significant looming deadline. And the comments require this further analysis. And can we just ask if it's feasible for the analysis to be done in time for the Navy's deadlines? Or maybe I have this wrong, but I'd like to hear some assessment as to the feasibility of getting this analysis done for the view shed?'",

I'm hopeful that once we get this analysis that everyone's on the same page and that it can be an amicable for just getting everyone on the same is really important. I think it's just a lack of data is what everyone's really worried about right now. So, I think that NCPC's done a great job in facilitating this in the past, especially with massing and all of that stuff when we did the height studies. So, I'm hopeful that everyone that will be room and talking has the right set of tools and will have the right information to have that analysis. I did want to mention, one thing that I was kind of surprised that the EDR didn't really go into and I'm hopeful we have more information by the time this comes back'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'to us, we didn't have a lot of information about transportation down there. I mean, there was a lot of analysis from all the parking spaces and all of that, but there's not a lot of analysis on how we're going to get people down here. So, one of the things about this project, to my understanding, is it's going to have like restaurants, all that great stuff that we have on river fronts everywhere else, but this is a really difficult place to get to. And there's only one way in or out of this entire complex. And it's going to be at 11th and O Street, unless you want to walk along the River Walk all the way. So, I'm a little worried about what impacts is this going to have on traffic down here, if there are people riding cars, there are three bus lines that run'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'by here, but they are very low quality bus stops right now. And given the fact that this might not go through the traditional D.C. type zoning process where those kinds of things would be discussed, I'm hopeful that the District, Redbrick, the Navy can come together maybe and look at like do we put a higher quality bus shelter, or even a low quality bus shelter there instead of just a sign? Because if we're expecting people, both east and west of the river, to be able to get here and take advantage of these new public amenities, I just want to make sure that we're not creating a -- even though it might have electric chargers and all that, I want to make sure we're not creating a vehicle intensive place because literally there's just a two-lane road currently at 11th and O that gets you in and'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'out of this entire site. And it looks like we'll have quite a few units. So, I'm hopeful that maybe there's a little bit more discussion when this comes back to us about some of those external things that maybe don't get considered when it's a Navy project because they're worried about employees and here, we're going to have people living on federally leased land. So, I'm just hopeful we'll have a little bit more information about that next time as well as just looking at the security perimeter and are we going to get rid of these walls and have this integrate with 11th Street and the community? So, just some of the things I'm hoping to hear about by the time this comes back to us.'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes.'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'Well, good afternoon, Chair Goodmann and members of the Commission. The District Department of Transportation, or DDOT, submitted a concept plan for the design of the standalone small cell pole for your review and comment. As the lead agency and liaison with the cellular providers, DDOT worked with NCPC and other federal and local agencies to develop a design for the pole pursuant to the small cell guidelines that were approved in 2019. Before I dive into the design of the pole, I'll provide a brief overview of what small cell technology is and summarize the District's small cell guidelines. Cellular companies are deploying small cell infrastructure, a lower powered antenna technology to reduce data traffic on roof mounted equipment and larger cell towers. Carriers can use -- can install signal equipment for their own use, while some can co-locate on the same pole through hoteling. This new technology requires'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'significant infrastructure that can affect the aesthetics and function of public streets and spaces as the antennas need to be closer to our devices. As you can see here, there are multiple applications for this infrastructure, such as attaching to existing street lights or utility poles, or employing standalone pole installations. Small cell facilities are generally located on poles between 30 and 35 feet in height. This height is necessary to accommodate signal transmission along the street corridor. Antenna equipment, cabinetry, and other elements are also provided in varying combinations, all of which have the potential to impact the character and the function of the streetscape. And this infrastructure is not invisible. So, early on, NCPC, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the District's State Historic Preservation Office realized that the design of this infrastructure within the District needs to be well coordinated and reviewed. We have some examples here'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'of small cell poles that are deploying in other cities across the country. Other places have attached different types of street infrastructure to the small cell pole such as street lights or traffic signals. Whereas, we realized early on that this needs to be its own piece of infrastructure and designed as minimally as possible to reduce impacts to significant view sheds. The Commission has been involved with the development of the District's small cell guidelines since the initiative began in 2018. It provided comments on the draft guidelines twice before approving the guidelines in March of 2019. And as I mentioned today, the Commission is providing comments on the conceptual design of the standalone small cell pole. The guidelines cover several topics, including preferred locations for small cells and siting within the streetscape. And in all cases, the guidelines state a preference for mounting small cell antennas to existing'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'street lights or utility poles whenever possible, and using standalone poles when the use of existing infrastructure is insufficient or absent. Foremost, the guidelines state that no small cell infrastructure requiring a standalone pole is to be installed until the pole has been reviewed and adopted by the District's Public Space Committee which will follow a review by NCPC and the Commission of Fine Arts. The Commission's comments on the guidelines were primarily concerned with impacts to the character and function of the public realm within the federal core, including antenna facility placement, spacing, and pole design, and attachment. The Commission's comments were incorporated into the approved guidelines, including a provision for the design of the standalone small cell pole to be developed by a stakeholder group and approved separately. I would like to note that the federal interest in the design and placement of small cells within District rights'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'of way is limited to the federal core due to the presence of unique federal and cultural resources, federal resources with dividing characteristics of the nation's most important public realm and buildings. Therefore, NCPC was also involved in defining the review process for installation of small cells within the District's rights of way and developed a federal core interest area map that was adopted with the guidelines. The federal core interest area map balances the need for adequate cellular coverage with visual impacts to important federal buildings, the national parks, and the areas surrounding the National Mall. Staff prepared the map which identifies acceptable small cell facility locations adjacent to federal property. This map excludes the National Mall itself, Constitution, Independence, and Pennsylvania Avenues. A separate analysis of standalone small cell poles within these areas is being led by the National Park Service in coordination with the Department of Homeland'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'Security to address cellular capacity during large events. Design for a standalone small cell pole in the National Mall area has not yet been developed. In developing the map, staff's goal was to allow for small cell coverage across the federal interest area and to increase the spacing of the facilities. Staff took about four weeks to develop a map of potential small cell facilities which resulted in an average of one pole per block space for those under 450 feet in length, and two poles for longer blocks. This is an example of how NCPC study influenced the location of small cells within the federal core. Here is an existing view looking south along 10th Street between Pennsylvania Avenue and Constitution Avenue with the National Museum of Natural History in the distance. And here is a rendering of small cell poles placed in the streetscape with multiple poles on'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'each side of the street. This reflects the spacing originally proposed by the carriers prior to NCPC's review. And here are the poles that were eliminated for the federal core interest area map. Three poles were eliminated and three remained so that coverage could still be provided. In this case, prominent poles in the view shed and those blocking a bus stop and pedestrian access were eliminated. Regarding the review process, any facility location identified on the federal core interest area map does not need further review by NCPC, as the carrier seeks an exception from the guidelines within the streets identified on the map are adjacent to any federal property, the exception request will necessitate NCPC's review and concurrence prior to the initiation of permit review by DDOT. Further, any proposal to move or alter temporary or a permanent security elements along or adjacent to federal property requires NCPC's'",

Now, moving on to the purpose of this presentation today and the Commission's review, which is the design of the standalone small cell pole. As intended by the guidelines, DDOT has worked with NCPC, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, other District agencies, and the carriers over the last year to develop the design for the standalone small cell poles, which I will now discuss. The total height of the proposed pole with the carrier equipment is approximately 30 feet. The base of the pole measures five- foot, six inches tall, and 20 inches in diameter. The pole tapers from 8 inches in diameter at the base to 3.8 inches in diameter at the top. The small cell antennas will be mounted at the top of the pole which measure approximately'",
        "'MS. FREE': 'four feet in height. All equipment associated with the antennas will be concealed within the base of the pole. The pole itself transitions to the base with a decorative shroud that is similar in style to the shrouds found on Washington globe street lights. Overall, staff comments favorably on the tall, slim profile of this standalone pole with a tapered post, decorative transition shroud, and equipment concealed within the base. Staff supports the proposed approach to use a single pole design that can accommodate different cellular carrier antennas. Here, we have illustrations of the pole with each of three carrier small cell antennas mounted to the top. You can see that a generally consistent height of approximately 30 feet is achieved from the ground level to the top of the antenna. And here, we have a few images that show the progression of the pole design. Originally, a design with'",

Overall, staff appreciates the efforts of the District Department of Transportation and the cell carriers to address the working groups comments on the design of the standalone pole. The submission materials include illustrations of District street lights and other streetscape furniture such as trash receptacles and bicycle sharing stations for comparison of scale and aesthetics. You can see here, the diameter of the standard trash receptacle is 25 inches compared with the diameter of the pole space, which is 20 inches. This illustration compares the base width and total height of the proposed standalone pole with existing District street light typologies. The scale of the base and the overall height of the standalone pole at approximately 30 feet are more consistent with'",

And therefore, staff requests that the applicant evaluate if the pole and base heights can be reduced further to a more pedestrian friendly scale.

Here, we have a view at 18th Street, Northwest with the proposed pole located in the image on the right. And a view at 13th and S Streets, Northwest, again, to the right and the image on the right with the pole shown here in gray.

And maybe I should say, I'm asking because I think it's just enough already. I mean, the original prototype for these things, you know, had these God awful trunks and, you know, or bolts that were going to have to be part and parcel of this whole thing.

I'll just let you know, it's been a day. The poles are designed to carry the weight of all of the technology that is in there for each carrier. And each carrier has different equipment positions. that is located in different It may -- some may be on top of each other, some need different spatial requirements.

They serve a modern purpose and the profile and the silhouette is about as slimmed down as we're going to get it.

So, it's come a long way. They've done a really good job, you know, listening and cooperating and understanding what -- how important it is. I mean, I have always used the example of the Department of Commerce which we own and it is on a -- it occupies an entire block, a 1,500 linear foot block. And several of these poles are going to be necessary just on that one block, not several, but more than one, more than two. And so, it's really important that they disappear as much as they can.'",

And I hate to say this, but maybe one of the best things that ever happened was that we stopped deliberating on this in 2019 and took a breath for three years and let the technology catch up. Because it's actually my hope that, given that we put a pause on this, we forced all the carriers to actually become a little bit more creative. So, four, five years ago, we were told, we can't volt any of this stuff. It can't go underground. Technologically, it's just not possible. I walked by one of these Verizon small cell towers every day that's just mounted to a standard light pole. And suddenly, there was'",

Like it's not --like all these things that we were told was impossible suddenly became possible because we actually forced them to be creative and use the technology. So, it's actually my hope that we won't need as many of these standalone poles. Because I mean, they're going to be bigger and uglier than their volted cousins. But and I would just say that, in discussions about making for more allowance for space, I think we need to remember, it's on the technology companies to keep shrinking their technology, and hopefully, come back at another time or maybe in five, ten years, and we don't even need these big ones. And as they're replaced, we can shrink them down. So, I'm glad that we kind of held firm and that NCPC, the District, all the stakeholders were able to work this out. And'",

The District Department of Transportation, DDOT, is seeking the Commission's comments on concept plans to alter the railings at the William Howard Taft Bridge along Connecticut Avenue as it crosses Rock Creek Parkway, Northwest, Washington, D.C. The purpose of the project is to develop a suicide deterrent barrier system that reduces the potential of suicide attempts, minimizes impacts to the existing historic bridge fabric and surrounding view sheds, and provides a deterrent barrier or replacement design that is compatible with the bridge aesthetics. The District Office of the Chief Medical Examiner data showed that 26 bridge related suicides occurred in Washington, D.C. between January 1st of 2010 and June 1st of 2022. Of which 13 fatalities occurred at the Taft Bridge. Here is a map showing the bridge's location in Northwest Washington which connects the Kalorama'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'and the Woodley Park neighborhoods. As this is a concept review, the focus of today's presentation and analysis is to receive Commission comments and feedback prior to preparation of a more detailed preliminary submission. In this case, the focus of the review is understanding the appropriateness of the project for the site and context, understanding any particularly unique or complex issues that need to be addressed, and identifying any stakeholders that may need to be further involved. As such, in today's presentation, I will identify comments for the Commission to adopt as guidance for further project development. Here are some other images of the bridge as it appears today. The Taft bridge was constructed between 1897 and 1907 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The bridge has been altered previously, most recently in 1995 when the bridge deck and sidewalks were altered and the concrete piers'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'and the metal railings replaced. DDOT and their design team hosted several meetings with review agencies to evaluate different approaches to alter the Taft bridge's railings in response to the project goals. The agencies agreed that the design options should avoid visual impacts from the Rock Creek Parkway and discourage options that would require alterations to the outside of the bridge such as netting or installing railings on the outside of the current railings. The agencies also agreed that a preferred approach should minimize impacts to the historic bridge's appearance. The applicant shared that, in order to meet the project goals, the design criteria for any options would need to include that the ideal barrier height is eight feet above any foothold with height reductions considered for barriers that are curved at the top or angled inward; maximize finger clearance to prevent handholds by reducing projections to less than one'",

WEBB': 'inch; minimize horizontal element projections that could be used for footholds, for example, anti-climb facade elements tend to slope any horizontal setback at 60 degrees or more; and a regard to materials for the alterations, consider metal picket fencing or metal mesh. DDOT submitted three design options for the Commission comment today. They include option one, which adds glazed panels. Option two, you see in the middle, which adds wire mesh. And option three, on the right, which replaces and reconstructs the existing concrete elements such as the piers and the metal railing. Let's start with looking at option one, which includes the installation of eight-foot tall glazed panels on the inside of the existing railing. The applicant indicated that for security and safety, as well as anti-graffiti defense, an optically clear polyester film could be included on the glazed panels. To address bird safety concerns, a film with UV'",

According to the submission, this approach generally has an acceptable avoidance index score from the American Bird Conservancy. Staff finds that option one may be a reversible treatment that minimizes physical impacts to the historic character of the bridge and is distinctly contemporary in its materiality. Further, the paneling would clearly be a modern addition due to the use of the contemporary materials. However, despite the options for films and other finishes, the potential remains for vandalism and increased maintenance due to cleaning. Further, despite its transparency, in real world application, glass remains highly visible and reflective. As such, staff finds the use of glass panels would require cleaning and maintenance, may be less transparent under many lighting conditions, and will be vulnerable to vandalism. And therefore, staff recommends that option one be'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'dismissed from further consideration. Next is option two, which includes the addition of welded wire mesh inside the existing railing. The mesh could be galvanized carbon steel plate barb size of one or two millimeters with an outer coating. According to the submission, the mesh is extremely difficult to cut or to climb. Like the first option, staff recommends that the Commission find this approach may also be a reversible treatment that could minimize physical impacts to the historic character of the bridge, and is distinctly contemporary in its material and design. However, staff recommends that the Commission also find that the mesh material, as rendered in the submission, does not contribute to an inviting or comfortable pedestrian experience. According to the applicant, additional types of architectural mesh could be considered, particularly those that are finer in scale than a welded wire mesh. As such, the density and transparency could'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'be further refined. Other components such as the stanchions, the frames, and color could be modified. Given the potential for further improvements to this approach, it may be worth further exploration to see if potential impacts to the pedestrian experience could be addressed. Therefore, staff suggests that the Commission recommend advancing option two for further development and request the applicant provide the following. Additional information on the design standard and deterrence level necessary for the mesh material because the standard and deterrence level have direct implications on the mesh density and transparency. And additional information on the size, the number, and types of stanchions needed, color options, and any measure that may help make the mesh less visibly obtrusive. The applicant should also provide additional examples of mesh use on other historic bridges. The final option for comment is option three, which includes the removal of the existing concrete elements'",

The existing lamppost would be raised to accommodate the increased height. This approach relies on the material and design approach of the historic bridge, although it would significantly alter existing fabric. The applicant has submitted three preferred variations under Option A with Option 3A including a simple, extruded concrete massing elevated to a minimum of eight feet with a three-quarter horizontal reveal at the original top profile of the concrete. The reveal defines the original railing height. Option 3B includes articulation with a four-inch setback for the additional height above the original concrete railing height. A sloped transition would also be incorporated. Option 3C includes an articulation, although the lampposts would remain at their existing height. Additional railing inserts would be needed at this location due to the'",

Therefore, staff finds option three, which includes replacing and reconstructing the existing concrete elements and metal railing results in direct impacts to historic character that would not be reversible. However, as compared to the other options, option three does not use new materials or a design vocabulary that is different from the existing bridge. Staff finds that reconstruction avoids the insertion of a new and discordant architectural components and recreates the existing configuration of pedestals, piers, and railings in the same materials and design character, but increased to the necessary height to achieve the intended public health and safety objectives. The raised height of the lampposts and their base is a challenge that will require additional exploration. The use of the setback and transition'",

Therefore, staff suggests that the Commission recommend advancing Option 3B for further development and request the applicant further evaluate the lamppost base and details as well as the treatment of the top of the metal railing including whether a curved top could be employed with a reduced height. As previously mentioned, staff recognizes the applicant's need to alter the Taft bridge's pedestrian railings in order to deter suicide attempts. Staff also appreciates that the applicant recognizes the historic nature of the bridge and the need to consider design solutions that minimize impacts to the historic character and important view sheds. Options 2 and 3B each could be further developed. So, therefore, staff suggests that the Commission recommend the applicant continue to develop options 2 and 3B, exploring'",

        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' Eight, five, one, nine, zero, four, seven, one, five --'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Excuse me.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER DIXON': ' -- zero, zero, zero, one.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Mr. -- Commissioner Dixon, yes, put on mute, please. Thank you. I'm sorry, Dr. Bebout.'",
        "'DR. BEBOUT': 'That's okay. Anyway, partnering with DDOT and the team from the design and engineering team. Just wanted to say quickly that, while none of us would ultimately want to be doing this, it really does seem, to us, absolutely necessary. And the creation of suicide deterrent barriers at bridges is -- the data really do show that that is the only effective way, and by far, the most effective way to prevent suicide deaths. We see this as a public health and public safety project involving a historic transportation asset. Half, exactly half of the bridge related suicide deaths in the District of Columbia since 2010 have occurred at the Taft bridge. So, while we fully appreciate the history and beauty of the bridge, and the team has worked incredibly hard to design something that have minimal impact, we, as a city government, certainly think that this is essential to'",
        "'DR. BEBOUT': 'move forward with and will save lives. The -- as I said, the data show that the strategy for suicide prevention, frankly, is putting time and distance between people and lethal means. And that when someone is temporarily interrupted or thwarted, it's very rare that they simply move to a different location. So, the construction of deterrent barriers at other bridges around the country and around the world really do lower suicide rates outright. And it is not just that they temporarily frustrate that impulse. If you talk to suicide -- people who have survived serious suicide attempts, most of them do not attempt again. And most of them go on to thrive and recover and are very glad that they did not die from their attempt. So, again, we thank you for the opportunity to present this. I guess the other thing I will say is, I'm not sure'",
        "'DR. BEBOUT': 'who all may be listening in, but our team has really been driven by a sense of urgency that has flowed from talking with people who have lost loved ones at the Taft bridge. And I want to just impart to you, to the Commission, as well, a sense of -- the sense forwarof urgency d with this. that we have about moving It will save live s. So, thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Well, thank you, Dr. Bebout. We really appreciate your input today. And thank you, too, Mr. Webb, for the excellent presentation. Do any of the Commissioners have questions for our speakers today? Yes, Commissioner Stidham?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' Mr. Webb, I saw in the EDR in your presentation regarding the 106 process. And I know that the 106 process has started. Can you tell me where we are in that process and what feedback these alternatives have received?'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'My understanding that there is no federal funding for this project. It is locally District funded. So, the Federal Highway is not involved. It did go before the District's Historic Preservation Review Board a week ago today. So, during the agency coordination that I know you participated in, there was some uncertainty whether a full blown Section 106 process was going to occur. But our understanding from DDOT, there is no federal funding. Our review is advisory, so NCPC does not have an independent Section 106 responsibility. I do not -- I think there will be additional agency coordination with the Commission of Fine Arts Because it does have to go back to the CFA. I'm sure the DC SHPO will also be participating in any additional agency meetings to continue to look at ways to refine the options. But I don't think there will be a full Section 106'",
        "'MR. WEBB': 'process.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' I know the District has its own 106 process when federal funding is not involved, so I wasn't sure if any of that material had been provided. We have been following it until it didn't look like we would have an action.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Right. Konnie with DDOT, do you have further information?'",
        "'MS. ESKENDER': ' Can you hear me?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Yes.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Yes.'",
        "'MS. ESKENDER': ' So, there was further discussion with Federal Highway and actually the contract we used had some federal funds and, Lee, just to update you, so, at the end, everybody agreed that there is Federal Highway participation. And Federal Highway did review the Section 106 initiation letter that was to SHPO. So, we are working closely with Andrew Lewis. And then, construct for the construction also for the highway we participate. So, that's the update.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' Okay, thank you.'",
        "'MS. ESKENDER': ' I wanted to update you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. If Commissioner Stidham has no further questions, Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Thanks. So, something really leapt out to me in the EDR that NCPC, CFA, the Park Service, SHPO, and I'm assuming DDOT all sat down together at the outset of reviewing this and somehow came to the conclusion that netting shouldn't even be considered. Could anyone speak to that a little bit more? I know that the report says there was a desire to minimize the impact -- visual impacts from Rock Creek. But was that kind of just like the end all, be all of just not even considering or throwing out a netting option?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' There were concerns with anything hanging off the sides. I think there was also a concern of the effectiveness of something hanging off the side as a suicide prevention. And I'm blanking out. It was quite a conversation related to things hanging off the side.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Yes.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' And I think that's where it ended is just, it was -- and I think SHPO weighed in also at that time stating his objections or concerns with things hanging off the outside. But I'll let DDOT speak more to that.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Ms. Eskender?'",
        "'MS. ESKENDER': ' In addition to what Ms. Stidham said, it will be very difficult for DDOT to inspect them and maintain the bridge. So, having this sort of netting would have caused an issue for us, bridge inspection and maintenance.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Mr. Wassef, did you have a comment?'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' No, Konnie addressed it already.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you.'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, thank you. Commissioner Cash --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Actually, I have'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' -- more questions?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' -- a second part to that. So, I'll get to this more in comment, but, to what extent, taking the same things into account with maintenance and visual impact, what kind of conversations were thought about about the actual experience of a pedestrian or a driver on the bridge itself when you're going to be ten feet away from the barrier as opposed to 130 feet down from when you're on the parkway? So, I know that NPS would probably have less of an interest in the experience of driving on the roadway. But I was wondering if like, internally with DDOT or stakeholders, if there was a thought to that same visual impact going across the bridge for the users?'",
        "'MS. ESKENDER': ' Commissioner Cash, if I understand, you're discussing about horizontal netting, right?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Well, the -- so, the three options that were presented to us, a lot of the discussion between the three options that we have in front of are talking about what the visual impact or what the impacts are with like maintenance and all that kind of stuff. But I don't really see anything talking about what the potential negatives of essentially like having these new interactions on the bridge with the actual users of the bridge as opposed to people that are looking up at the bridge from Rock Creek?'",
        "'MS. ESKENDER': ' So, I mentioned about inspection, we literally had the horizontal netting and tried to see how we would be able to inspect and then maintain it. So, that became a bigger issue for us. So, I don't know if I clearly stated it for you. It was part of the package, the horizontal netting, vertical netting, several concepts in the development considered this. we had when we'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' Okay. And then, my last question, I'll save the rest for comments. So, I did see in the presentation that, of the three options that have been kind of put forward with the glass, the mesh wire, and the raising of the wall, there's an approximate price tag associated with all those. Do we know what the approximate price tag of a netting option might have been or did we not even get that far after you kind of moved it out?'",
        "'MS. ESKENDER': ' No, we didn't get that far because, you know, it will deter us from the basic -- our basic bridge inspection and maintenance. Especially where the bridge is more than about a 100-year-old bridge. So, maintenance and inspection will be, you know, more frequent.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' And I'd be happy to hear anything from -- I see the engineering firm is on and might have some answer on that.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Anyone able to answer Commissioner Cash's question about cost, differentiated costs?'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': 'I can. We did not look at the cost of the netting at all because it was rejected from the first meeting from many agencies that we have to get the approval of this. I would like to emphasize something or clarify something that Konnie's talking about inspection and maintenance. She's not only talking about inspection and maintenance of the railing, but the bridge itself. This bridge is really high above the Creek View Park, so it's aesthetically inspected using what we normally term as a super snooper. It is a bucket truck with a longer arm with several joints that goes and a truck will be above the bridge and the arm goes out and below the bridge and an inspector is in the bucket under the bridge. If we add this netting, this will not allow the inspection of the bridge using this way because it has to'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': 'go out too far and this will eliminate the possibility of using these trucks. And basically, will -- that inspection will be either impossible or extremely expensive from the Creek View bucket to go up this high. So, this is the distinction we have all to be aware of.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Mr. Wassef. Do you have additional questions, Commissioner Cash?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' I'm good, but to the extent that I'll just have comments that are on point and happy to hear them. But that's all the questions I have.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, thank you. Commissioner Stidham?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' I wasn't sure, I just wanted to add that during many of the conversations that I participated in, there was extensive conversation regarding both the motorists and the pedestrian and cyclist experience crossing the bridge with any of these elements. So, I wasn't sure if your question got answered. thanks.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' That's helpful, Cash?'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you. Any further questions, Commissioner (NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE)'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' No? Commissioner Cash, if you have no further questions, Commissioner Wright?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': ' I'm good.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay. Commissioner Wright has a question or --'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Yes, that doesn't make sense to me that the bucket trucks can't be used with the netting, but they can be used with -- to go over an eight-foot solid addition to the bridge. How does that work? How can one be possible and not the other?'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' Because the eight-foot -- basically, if you look at the bucket truck, there's a mechanism on the truck makes this arm above eight feet. So, if you look at them working, it goes out and then when you make it horizontal it will clear the eight-foot very easily because it is not small truck, it's a full sized truck with the mechanism on top makes it higher than eight feet.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' But the mesh --in option two and option three, the height of the obstacle to the bucket truck is the same, is it not?'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' The mesh is a horizontal mesh, it is like 15 feet. It's extending horizontally out from the bridge. So, the arm has to go out, or much of the arm has to bow out over the bridge 15 feet horizontally, back down and back again the 15 feet before you are even under the bridge.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Do we have a section anywhere that shows that? Because that's kind of unclear that the -- or the section -- or profile? I don't really get this. That's not making sense to me.'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' I can send a picture of the truck if needed.'",
        "'MR. WEBB': ' I was about to say, I'm looking through the images I have, Commissioner Wright, Wagdy, do you know of one that could speak to what Commissioner Wright is asking in the presentation materials we have?'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' No, it is not in the exhibit in the material we sent you, but I can find a picture of an inspection truck.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' So, are you saying that the mesh option that is no longer being considered, but you're not talking about the mesh option that's option two here?'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' Oh no, no, no, no. The option two is eight-foot tall.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Okay. That's why it wasn't making sense.'",
        "'MR. WASSEF': ' Yes, yes, okay. I am sorry --'",
        "'MR. NISHIOKA': ' Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Wright. I think a little bit of misconfused. We didn't present any horizontal netting in our presentation except we provided some sketches, area sketches as part of the presentation booklet. But what Mr. Webb, Lee, presented option A, B, C or like one, two, three, we didn't present any of the horizontal netting.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Okay.'",

        "'MS. PAGATS': 'Thank you. Hi, there, I'm Janell Pagats, an Advisory Neighborhood Commission in Woodley Park representing 3C03 and the current chair of ANC 3C. Our commission area represents the residents directly north of the William Howard Taft Bridge. I am authorized to represent the ANC 3C on this matter. On April 13th, 2022 my neighbor, Dr. Peter Tripp, jumped off the Taft Bridge. His death was not covered in the media at that time as suicides are typically not something that the press covers. I was made aware of his death in May of 2022 by a friend of his partner, also my neighbor, and now friend, Dr. Chelsea Van Thof. By June of 2022, we had done our research and discovered just how dangerous this bridge is. ANC 3C passed a resolution in June of 2022 calling for the installation of protective bridge barriers on William Howard Taft Bridge. This'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': 'passed on consent, emphasizing the immediate need to take action. ANC 3C also submitted a letter regarding the William Howard Taft Bridge Pedestrian Railing Improvement Project Concept Design into the HPRB record. ANC 3C voted unanimously by a voice vote to approve providing written comments. Those comments asked that the HPRB concur with the recommendation of the Commission of Fine Arts and approve Option 3B. All of the options presented within Option 3 replace the piers and railings of the bridge in the same design character and increased to a height of eight feet. ANC 3C agrees with CFA that this would be more harmonious with the bridge=s historic appearance than the other options, which would allow -- which would add a new barrier system next to the existing railings. ANC 3C also understands the complexity of undertaking -- of this undertaking on the historic bridge, and agrees with CFA'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': 'members expressed willingness to further consider Option 2. ANC 3C also requested that HPRB not further delay this project with more design options and further reviews. The statistics cited in our June 2022 resolution have not been updated since then, and the reality is that we require even more urgency to protect lives now than we did then. At the HPRB meeting, Board members agreed with the urgent need for this safety infrastructure and that no further delay should be taken. They also stated that if experts say the barriers need to be eight feet tall to be most effective, they should be eight feet tall. I will note that the data provided to us by the D.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner investigated a total of 26 suicide deaths that involved a decedent jumping from a bridge from January 1, 2010, to June 1, 2022. Of those 26,'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': '15 deaths occurred at the William Howard Taft and Duke Ellington Bridge, 13 at the Taft and 2 at the Ellington. The Ellington barriers are not consistently eight feet tall across the entire bridge. No one wants to put barriers on this beautiful, historic bridge. We need to put barriers on the bridge. The whole of the Government of the District of Columbia has worked hard and fast, recognizing the long overdue need for this safety infrastructure. As the architect Michael Murphy has said, architectural design is never neutral, it either helps or it hurts. The built environment is a profoundly powerful influence in everyone's daily lives. A bridge, by definition, is something that is intended to reconcile or form a connection between two things. The Taft Bridge is not performing as defined and its architectural design is hurting people. The submission you are tasked with reviewing can rectify these'",

ANC 3C also recognizes and greatly appreciates and thanks the effort and tremendous work of everyone involved in this important public safety project, the survivors and advocates, the Executive Office of the Mayor, the Council and staff, DDOT, DBH, and the project team. This has been a collaborative effort with everyone working as hard and as fast as they can to get what needs to be done done. Time is of the essence when it comes to installing the railing, and the gift of time to those most vulnerable is what this project will provide. The bridge is unsafe and we can and need to fix it.

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Proceed.'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': 'Okay. This testimony is being read on behalf of Dr. Chelsea Van Thof, surviving partner to Dr. Peter David Tripp, one of many in crisis who have fallen victim to the Taft Bridge. She thanks the NCPC and the members of the public for their time and attention. I'll begin by sharing some evidence- based findings related to suicide prevention and restricting access to means. Multiple studies have shown that nine out of ten people who attempt suicide and survive will not go on to die by suicide at a later date. And that, in general, research has shown that persons thwarted and utilizing a preferred method of suicide do not typically seek other approaches to kill him or herself. From a 2017 study comparing different suicide prevention measures at bridges, barriers and safety nets were most --were both effective with mean suicide reduction of 68.7 percent barriers and 71.1'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': 'percent safety nets, respectively. Measures that do not secure the whole hot spot and still allow jumps of 15 meters or more were less effective. Further, the analysis revealed that barriers of at least 2.3 meters in height and safety nets fixed significantly below pedestrian level deterred suicidal jumps. Secured bridge heights and inbound angled barriers seem to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. Findings can help plan and improve the effectiveness of future suicide prevention measures on high structures. I would like to stress the implication of these findings to improve the effectiveness of future suicide prevention measures as opposed to using them as a bare minimum with which to preserve an inanimate structure whose design has proved to be a danger to public safety. And finally, from a September 2022 Washington Post opinion piece submitted by an architect directly involved in the design of the Ellington Bridge barrier'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': 'in the 1980s, shortly after a grassroots advocacy for this barrier gained immediate attention. Amortized, the $229,000 cost of this prevention effort equates to less than $2,000 per life saved, a cost that is declining daily. This compares with the average costs to society of a suicide at $1.33 million. To those who argue that thwarting access to a lethal jumping site is a waste of money, D.C.'s experiment resoundingly counter argues with data, not true. To summarize these points, suicide is often impulsive. Restricting access to means is one of the most effective ways to save people who would otherwise die by suicide. Barriers have been proven to work at preventing suicide over and over. And this preventative measure is actually cheaper for the city than letting more people die. My late partner, Dr. Peter Tripp, whose death by suicide was facilitated by the Taft Bridge in April of'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': '2022. And I often walked our dog on both the Ellington and Taft Bridges. Never once did the presence of a suicide -- of the suicide barrier on the Ellington cross my mind. Not its obstruction of views, nor the fact that it was there for any purpose. Now, it's purpose lives rent free in my head. The first time I ever considered the view from the Ellington Bridge was the night that I looked through its suicide barrier and saw Peter's police lights under the Taft. And let me assure the members of the Committee, my view was not at all obstructed. Since losing Peter, I've heard the sentiment, I didn't even realize it was there, in reference to the guardrails on the Ellington Bridge. I would like to emphasize to those in opposition to a lifesaving barrier of effective height on the Taft on the basis of disrupting'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': 'its historic integrity, that we've disrupted its integrity for strictly aesthetic purposes in the past. Now, here, we are faced with an evidence-supported solution to death by suicide from the Taft and its successful implementation is not yet guaranteed which only means that the lives of people in crisis in our community are also not guaranteed. I would like to draw your attention to an excerpt from Executive Director's recommendation, the Commission recommended as an Option 3B for further development and request the applicant further evaluate the lamppost-based details as well as the treatment of the top metal railing, including whether a curved top could be employed to reduce height. I want to address this quandary. will reiterate the findings of a study comparing the effectiveness of barriers safety nets in preventing deaths by suicide. Measures that do not secure I and the whole hot spot and still allow jumps'",

The height of the barrier in the Ellington stands at eight feet and has been effective in deterring suicides since its implementation in 1986. Eight feet is the recommended height based on various research analysis and for this governing entity to potentially delay this critical project any longer in an effort to find evidence against the expert conclusions reflected in design Option 3B is nothing less than a public health risk. The Taft has already claimed another victim since Peter left. And respectfully, anymore lives lost on this bridge will be by the NCPC's --'",
        "'MR. MORGAN': ' Five minutes.'",
        "'MS. PAGATS': ' Just to drive my point home, I would like to remind everyone here, that a barrier for the Taft was slated in the same time period as the Ellington. So, the point newspaper -- where a newspaper article referenced plans for construction in 1987. But any reference to a barrier on the Taft disappears from the public record after that time. And you guys have a copy of this. So, I'll just read the last paragraph here. When I hear concerns about the aesthetic component, the view, knowing this barrier will be effective in saving the lives of those in crisis make those bars beautiful to me. Let's make history today with the approval of a lifesaving barrier with an evidence based design. The Taft Bridge setting a precedent for suicide prevention in our community.

And there is beauty in making sure that our infrastructure keeps us safe. And I think that is something that's very congruent with what I understand to be NCPC's ambitions. And that's something that we take really seriously as well. So, I appreciate the time to be able to speak today and hope that we see some progress soon.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, and we appreciate you, Mr. Wood. Thank you for bringing your testimony to the Commission today. Does anyone have any questions for Mr. Wood? Any Commissioners have questions at this time? (NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE)'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Okay, well, hearing none, thank you, Mr. Wood. Thank you, Ms. Pagats. And we are going to move on now to open it up to the Commission for discussions. I would entertain a motion to approve the comments on the concept plans for the Taft Bridge Pedestrian Rail Improvements. Is there a motion?'",
        "'VICE CHAIR HEWLETT': ' So moved, Madam Chair.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' It's been moved by Vice Chair Hewlett. Is there a second?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' Second.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Seconded by Commissioner Stidham. All right, thank you for those, motion for that and that second. And I'm going to move on, and I'm going to begin with Commissioner Cash, if you have comments on this presentation.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'Oh, definitely. I definitely want to thank our ANC Commissioners for coming and providing their testimony and giving us the results of their Commission's deliberations. I'd like to thank Ms. Van Thof, even though she couldn't be here today, I know my boss had several conversations with her and she's been very active on this issue for a number of years. I do want to go back a little bit to some process issues. So, I did hear some desire not to lengthen this process and I'm in no way advocating to lengthen this process to see more options. I do want to just note that it's unfortunate to -- so, this reprogramming to undertake this study happened back, I think, last March, $850,000 to do the study that's before us now to help us make these decisions. So, we can't fix what's already been done but I think it'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'would have been nice to have that fourth option to look at. We heard in the testimony of Ms. Van Thof that, by some estimates, the netting systems are actually even more effective than the barrier system. So, I know the studies out there go both ways. I do want to note that I was talking about price and no one could put a price on how important this project is moving forward. It needs to move forward. I think that we have to remember that, going forward, the District is going to need to put its money where its mouth is. So, I'm hopeful that when the Mayor submits their budget, which ever option that we turn out landing on after these next processes, that we get this moving as quickly as possible. Because I know NCPC approval is important, but it's also important that the District be able'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'to get the option, refine it, and make sure that it's implemented. Because I think that the need that was expressed by the ANC Commissioners and Ms. Van Thof's testimony speaks to that. So, when I was bringing up things like questions about some of the feasibility or cost options, I think that we -- it's good to have all the options on the table. So, I hope that going forward, when we have projects like this, that especially when we're spending $700,000 on this presentation that we've essentially gotten and these options have been put forward, that we really look at all the options. Because I think that we've got to really missed opportunity to really compare some apples to apples here and have those conversations about the aesthetic on the bridge and what these maintenance problems could have been. So, I'm no way advocating that I'm going to'",
        "'COMMISSIONER CASH': 'vote -- well, I am going to vote in favor of this, I'm no way advocating that we slow this down. But I just hope in the future that we have a little bit of an open mind with -- because these are very strange projects that we have when we have so many different federal interests and local interests involved. So, I will just leave it at that. And thanks, again, to all of the advocacy that's gone on behind this project.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank Commissioner Cash, excellent points. Next we are going to hear Commissioner Davis. you, from (NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE)'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Commissioner Davis had to leave, I believe. Commissioner Giachetti, are you here?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GIACHETTI': ' I am here, thank you very much. No comments.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Giachetti. Commissioner Cozart?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER COZART': ' Just want to also appreciate the ANC Commissioners for testifying and for doing their advocacy around this. And thanks to the staff for their presentation. I comments. don't have any additional'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner McMahon?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER MCMAHON': ' Thank you. I appreciate the testimony from the ANC Commissioners, impactful testimony backing up on how important this project is, important that they move forward. With that, I'm going to associate myself with Commissioner Cash, which probably doesn't happen often. But I think, certainly, this issue, and it kind of even reflects on our prior discussion about the Navy Yard, about really looking at options to meet the critical need and how we solve them. I'm disappointed that there wasn't more thought given into the netting as a potential solution. I think that while it's not the most important thing, view sheds and from the walkers across, I think it's important. We'll lose that, but we'll lose it for an important reason. And so, we'll look to, you know, clear our way out of this so the District can get on with putting something in place. Thank you.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Commissioner McMahon. Thank you, Commissioner Stidham?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER STIDHAM': ' No comments, but I do want to thank the District, how they have approached this and the thoughtfulness they have put into the project. And really, that's it.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Commissioner Stidham. Thank you, Commissioner Argo?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER ARGO': ' Mic? I'll associate my remarks with Commissioner McMahon's on this. And I feel, after hearing the presentation and understanding what, you know, getting information that I haven't had before, while I have a sense of urgency about it. And you know, it involves --anything that involves potential lifesaving. So, I support this and I support any effort to move it forward in an expeditious way.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Commissioner Argo. Commissioner -- Vice Chair Hewlett, please?'",
        "'VICE CHAIR HEWLETT': ' Yes, first, I'd like to thank ANC Commissioners Pagats and Wood for their presentations today. While many of us may or several of us may have lost dear loved ones or friends to suicide, myself included, I learned things today from them that I did not know, and in terms of the number of deaths from --particularly from that bridge, the Taft Bridge. And it's just really tragic and is eye opening. And while it is a very beautiful historic bridge, but saving lives takes precedent. And I just really, really want to thank you for that. So, that was all I had to add.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Thank you, Vice Chair Hewlett, thank you very much. Commissioner Green?'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'Thank you very much. I appreciate all the thought that went into this. And in the, for me, in the sense of urgency, I would, as Dr. Bebout and others mentioned, I obviously support the removal of option 1, but I would also support the removal of option 2. I don't believe this adds anything architecturally to the solution. It's a mere utilitarian approach that adds nothing to the bridge. Pursue Option 3B is -- has the impact and the potential to be extraordinarily safe and beautiful. The only quality of -- the only good quality about option 2 is that it's reversible. But shouldn't our interventions be permanent? Should they be worth keeping? And I think option 3B does that. And I would personally like to see a focus on 3B in the interest of speed as the option that provides safety, but does it in a way that's'",
        "'COMMISSIONER GREEN': 'beautiful and, you know, in our protecting peoples lives doesn't have to be utilitarian. We beashould utiful aprotect people nd humane. in a way that's Commissione And thank you very mu'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' r Green, for your remark Commissioner Wright? ch. Thank s. you,'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'Well, I'm having difficulty with this because I just -- I think it's been -- there's a reductivist approach that makes it seem like a binary choice. And I don't think it is. I think that -- and I also don't necessarily -- I've spent a career trying not to make decisions based on fear of setting a precedent, but in this case, I think I'd make an exception. Because we're looking at setting a precedent for deterrence and this city has, I don't know how many, beautiful bridges like this, but a dozen anyway. And before we say that, you know, that urgency is king and I have a real -- I have visceral response to changing the bridge in the sense that it's permanent and irreversible and completely changes the character of the bridge. And to say that it's either or suggests that permanently changing, you know, the'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': 'bridge is a vote for not caring about people who commit suicide. And I don't think it's that simple. And I think it is worth taking the time to get it right. I think that the option 3 has potential to be less bad than what it looks like now. But I don't think I could say that it's going to be an improvement other than in the function that it serves. And I'm not -- no one's going to argue that it isn't necessary. I don't -- it's just that I think spending more time looking at what could be a de minimis approach because we're in the business of preserving cultural patrimony and we need to take it seriously.'",
        "'MR. MORGAN': ' We'll be ready at 8:15 so we need to probably leave here at --'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': ' Steve, you need to mute yourself right now.'",
        "'COMMISSIONER WRIGHT': ' Anyway, so, I -- it's not to minimize the seriousness of the problem we're seeking to solve, but I don't know that it's one or the other. And I don't know that taking a little bit more time to get this as good as we can get it isn't worth doing it. Because there are many other bridges. And if we decide that this is the appropriate approach, I can imagine other bridges in Washington becoming unrecognizable in the future as we try to solve for -- solve this problem. And I don't think that's advisable.'",
        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': 'Thank you, Commissioner Wright. And so, to close, I would just like to say, again, thank you to those who provided testimony and for the research that was provided. I think it is very comp lex that the design of public infrastructure and user experience has to, first and foremost, consider public health and safety. And I think that that is important and I think that's been discussed here. And it's clear that the applicant has put in a great deal of thought on this and thought about what possible solutions can be proposed. I agree, there is a sense of urgency, again, when there's public health and safety involved. And I support the recommendation to further, you know, define the two of the alternatives to evaluate what the best approach would be and support that with proper speed to protect the public. Has Commissioner -- I think Commissioner Dixon'",

        "'CHAIR GOODMANN': ' Well, hearing none, Ms. Koster, can you please confirm the motion and the second and take the roll?'",
        "'MS. KOSTER': ' Yes. Vice Chair Hewlett made a motion to approve comments on the concept plans for the Taft Bridge Pedestrian Rail Improvements. It was seconded by Commissioner Stidham. And with that, I will ask Commissioner Cozart?'",

This concludes our open session. Our next regular meeting is December 7th of 2023. That's on Thursday and it will be at 1:00 p.m. But there is a retreat tomorrow and I just want to remind folks that I believe staff has asked that we be here by 8:45 in the morning. And we'll look forward to the conversation about what lies ahead for NCPC and in large and small ways. And I have been promised there will be coffee and we will have something to nosh on, I'm sure. So, if there's no further business, the Commission meeting stands adjourned. Thank you all very much.'"
