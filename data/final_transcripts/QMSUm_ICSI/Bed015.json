        "'speaker_F': 'So they could all have a type at the beginning.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, right.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'you know, I don't know, happy\", or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or, you know, some it'll be a specific word or maybe you'll have the type.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here\" or I need a directional specifier here\".'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So uh you could have a j a actual type here.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So a very common example of this is'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Right?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'sort of skipping fonts and whatever.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'The idea is that sometimes there are,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um, general constructions that you know, that you're going to need.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's it's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase, or something like that there.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And usually it has formal'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um, considerations that will go along with it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And then'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you're talking about, about what meaning what specific meaning you want.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So the example again at the bottom, which is directed motion, you might need a nominal expression to take the place of, you know, um, the big th\", you you know, the big the tall'",
        "'speaker_F': 'dark man\", you know, walked into the room\".'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But'",
        "'speaker_F': 'because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it's nominal of some kind but in particular, that it's some kind of animate'",
        "'speaker_F': 'nominal,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and which will apply just as well to like, you know, a per you know, a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, then I don't think the, um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'at least Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'None of these examples have anything'",
        "'speaker_F': 'different for formal constraints?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But you can refer to'",
        "'speaker_F': 'any of the, um, sort of available elements and scope, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'which here are the constructs,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'to say something about the relation.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um, we dropped like the littleF subscript.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'TheF subscripts refer to the form\" piece of the construct.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And I think that, um, in general it'll be unambiguous.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you're referring to the formal pole of that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So so by saying if I just said Name one\" then that means name one formal and we're talking about formal struc Which which makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh, there are certain times when we'll have an exception to that, in which case you could just indicate here I mean the meaningful for some reason\".'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or Actually it's more often that,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'only to handle this one special case of, you know, George and Jerry walk into the room in that order\".'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But but s we're not gonna really worry about that for right now and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, and so'",
        "'speaker_F': 'in terms of the the relations, you know, as usual they're before and ends.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation but in form you might also have'",
        "'speaker_F': 'a value binding.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'You know, you could say that, um, you know, name one dot\", t'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you know, number equals\", you know, a plural or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'There are certain things that are attribute value, similar to the bindings below but I mean'",
        "'speaker_F': 'they're just us usually they're going to be value'",
        "'speaker_F': 'value fillers, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'There was talk of changing the name of that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And Johno and I I you you and I can like fight about that if you like?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'but about changing it to semantic n effects\", which I thought was a little bit too'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_F': 'order biased and semantic bindings\", which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Th'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And so'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it was an issue whether constraints um, there were some linguists who reacted against constraints\", saying, oh, if it's not used for matching, then it shouldn't be called a constraint\".'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it's used for matching or not.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Cuz there are I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are, for'",
        "'speaker_F': 'actual, you know, sort of like modified constraining purposes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, you definitely want to de couple the formalism from the parsing strategy.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So that whether or not it's used for matching or only for verification, I'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's used shouldn't matter, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 's For sure.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, I don't know what, uh, term we want to use but we don't want to'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, uh, there was one time when when Hans explained why'",
        "'speaker_F': 'constraints\" was a misleading word for him.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term, which was just an interesting coincidence.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, but,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh And so I was like, OK, well both of you don't like it?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Fine, we can change it\".'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's g it's gone.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But I I I'm starting to like it again.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that that's why That's why I'll stick with it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'If you have an if then\" phrase, do you know what the then\" phrase is called?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Th'",
        "'speaker_F': 'What?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Con uh, a'",
        "'speaker_F': 'consequent?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, but it's not an if then\".'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Anyway, so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, but'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'when you don't know what word to put, you could put no word,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'just meaning.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And the then let'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, that's true.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down down here?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, oops!'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I didn't mean that one's an in unintentional.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So this should be semantic and'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Sometimes I'm intentionally inconsistent cuz I'm not sure yet.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Here, I actually it was just a mistake.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Th so this definitely should be semantic constraints\" down at the bottom?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, unless I go with meaning\" but i I mean, I kind of like meaning\" better than semantic\" but I think there's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'vestiges of other people's biases.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or wh'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Like'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That b Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Minor min problem OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Minor point.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Extremely.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information, ex than the top block.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And the bottom block'",
        "'speaker_F': 'similarly only just illus you know, all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and that you can drop the, um uh, that you can give dual types.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, one thing I should mention is about designates\".'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I think I'm actually inconsistent across these as well.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, um, strike out theM subscript on the middle block.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So basically now, um, this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change, which is that designates\" isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So we want s designates\" to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of, um, really important for say composition later on.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So for instance, if some other construction says, you know, are you of type is this part of type whatever\", um, the designates\" tells you which sort of part is the meaning part.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, so if you have like the big red ball\",'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you know, you wanna know if there's an object or a noun.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it's useful sometimes to talk about,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that'll be the same one, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So the ball is the head of the phrase,\" the r the\", um, big red ball\", and the entity denoted by the word ball\" is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of, um, in interesting larger element.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'A a and the Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And there's uh there's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And and this enables you to get that, if I understand you right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's the idea.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And, uh, you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head final language, you can refer to the head as a p the, you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that's a useful thing so that you can get some internal'",
        "'speaker_F': 'structural constraints in.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, so that all looks good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Let me'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, w Oh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Were you finished?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'there was a list of things that isn't included but you you can you can ask a question.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That might'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, i'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if I understand this'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the aside from, uh, construed and all that sort of stuff, the the differences are mainly that,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we've gone to the possibility of having form meaning pairs for a type or actually gone back to, if we go back far enough'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, except for their construction meaning, so it's not clear that,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh Well, right now it's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So I don't know what a form'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, I see.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'type is.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm sorry, you're right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'A construction type.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But it, um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'A well, and a previous, um, you know, version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning'",
        "'speaker_F': 'bit by it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So you could say construct of type whatever designates something\".'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But that was mostly for reference purposes, just to refer to the meaning pole.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning, which is really what we want most of the time I think.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, I was asking Hans about this.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'They use it to really mean, um, this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'OK, so how is it so designate\"'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Does that Is that really what they mean in in'",

        "'speaker_F': 'and may maybe he's wrong.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Or if you talk about an adjective red\", it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'OK, it's like uh, it's not it might be that there's a syntactic, uh, device that you use to indicate focus or that there are things like, you know, I think Keith was telling me, things toward the end of the sentence, post verbal, tend to be the focused focused element, the new information.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mmm.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'And when you, uh,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So that's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing.'",

        "'speaker_F': '\" Stress\" I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, um,'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And that's just a uh, w we'll want to distinguish stress as a form device.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So focus carries along a scope.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Like if you're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But I think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So for instance, you could say it's the the tense on this as opposed to, um, the the action.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or it's uh, it's an identity thing or a contrast with other things, or stress this value as opposed to other things.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it's it is kind of like a profile'",
        "'speaker_F': 'profile background'",
        "'speaker_F': 'thing but I I can't think of like the limited set of'",
        "'speaker_F': 'possible meanings that you would that you would'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Light up with focus, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'focu light highlight'",
        "'speaker_F': 'as opposed to other ones.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So it has some certain complications for the,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, uh later on.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Li I mean, uh, the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'For instance, you Oh, one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements and that's probably relevant for the like where is\",'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you know, the castle\" kind of thing?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Anyway.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that's onl there are there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation but it's most I think it's this is,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you know, the current current form.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Other things we didn't'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But I think the not inherently like the general principles still work though, that, um, we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like, you know, for instance, one Uh, you know, they they have constituents, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So you can like nest things when you need to, but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience, then like this this might, you know, be a little o opaque.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
