        "'speaker_F': 'It's not indicated with, um uh, tight precision, it's just indicated that'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, so,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's indicated to to so the people know what parts of sp which which stretches of speech were in the clear, versus being overlapped by others.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, I used this mark and, um'",

        "'speaker_F': 'And, um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'What you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right, whether they involve two speakers, three speakers, or more than three speakers.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And, um and, what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of whether they're distributed evenly throughout or whether they're bursts of them.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And it looked to me as though'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, you know y this is just'",
        "'speaker_F': 'eh eh, this would this is not statistically verified,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout, rather than being localized to a particular region.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'The part down there, where there's the maximum number of of, um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So it's like, you know, rather, lively discussion there.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, th'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's the per cent.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mmm.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'At the very end, this is when people were, you know, packing up to go basically, there's this final stuff, I think we I don't remember where the digits fell.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I'd have to look at that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But the final three there are no overlaps at all.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'one particular meeting, and also there's been no statistical testing of it all, but'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I took the coding of the I, you know, my I had this script figure out, um who was the first speaker, who was the second speaker involved in a two person overlap, I didn't look at the ones involving three or more.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And, um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with who who else, and if you look at the marginal totals, which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom, you get the totals for an individual.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Raw counts.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And there, it looks like you see some differences, um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'that some people tend to be overlapped'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh sure.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And it would be, you know of course, there's also the question of what type of overlap was this, and w what were they, and i and I and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and, probably more, I mean, the general'",
        "'speaker_F': 'cultural idea which w uh, the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking, and and you know, I mean, w we know that an and they've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time, that that that's that's viewed as being a culturally relative thing, I mean, that you have the high involvement style from the East Coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And Yeah, exactly!'",

        "'speaker_F': 'And and, you know, in contrast, so Deborah d and also Deborah Tannen's thesis she talked about differences of these types, that they're just different styles, and it's um you you can't impose a model of there of the ideal being no overlaps, and you know, conversational analysts also agree with that, so it's'",
        "'speaker_F': 'now, universally a ag agreed with.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'using, um a fairly long filter length.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Uh well, actually I guess depends on what you mean by long, you know, tenth of a second sorts of numbers.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_H': 'uh, thresholding as the way of generating the candidates.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks.'",
