        "'speaker_E': 'the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so,'",

        "'speaker_E': 'uh, at some point before the meeting, uh, say the day before.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on Wednesday, or Tuesday send out a reminder'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That'll help a lot, actually.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have, Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And uh, she ends up getting the agenda requests uh, uh ten minutes before the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But'",
        "'speaker_E': 'but'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But we can try.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Maybe it'll work.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Weirder things have happened.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I'm wondering if he were to just, uh, specify particular topics, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Maybe we'd be able to'",
        "'speaker_F': 'meet that request of his a little more.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well then'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Actually it This this maybe brings up another topic which is um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So we're done with that topic.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The other topic I was thinking of was'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the sta status on microphones and channels, and all that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, actually I I was going to say we need to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'talk about that too.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Why why don't we do that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, the new microphones, the two new ones are in.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And they are being assembled as we speak, I hope.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And I didn't bring my car today so I'm gonna pick them up tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, and then the other question I was thinking about is well, a couple things.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'First of all,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable, we should probably just go ahead and get them.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So we'll have to evaluate that when they come in, and get people's opinions on on what they think of them.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Another wireless setup.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean it's expensive, but it does seem to be'",
        "'speaker_C': 'better than the wired.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So how many channels do you get to have'",
        "'speaker_E': 'in a wireless setup?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'well, I'm pretty sure that you can daisy chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'possibility of six wireless receivers, and apparently you can chain those together.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, um.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So let's see we'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, you know it's still, it's fifteen minus six.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So we could have up to nine.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And right now we can have up to six.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And we have five, we're getting one more.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And it's um, about nine hundred dollars for the base station, and then eight hundred per channel.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So yeah so the only Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, we should do it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, so I'll look into how you daisy chain them and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and then just go ahead and order them.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't quite understand how that how that works, If'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So we're not increasing the number of channels.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, we're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'along with a couple of the wired that aren't working, one of the wired that's not working, with a wireless.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Basically we found'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Three wireds work, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I guess three wireds work, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But we've had more problems with that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'we we seem to have uh, a reliable way of getting the data in, which is through the ra Sony radio mikes, as long as we're conscious about the batteries.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That seems to be the key'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Everyone's battery OK?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'issue.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I checked them this morning, they should be.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the only thing with them.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But the quality seems really good and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um I heard from UW that they're'",
        "'speaker_E': 'they're uh very close to getting their, uh setup purchased.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They're they're they're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and so, you know, what we should try to keep everyone'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'on the same page with that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'SRI, really?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'They got sa apparent'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Maybe this needs to be bleeped out?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I have no clue.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I don't know how much of it's public.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But anyway there's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'there's there's uh, uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and NIST and UW.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'radio mikes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'which means some hand soldering or something, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, no, we're having the them do it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'No?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it's so hand soldering it, but I'm not doing it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, they they charge right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Nothing against you and your hand soldering but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You've never seen my hand soldering.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK, so that's being done professionally and Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'a as I said they're coming in.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I I mean Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'As professionally as I guess you can get it done.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'it could if they do a lot of it, it's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean i it's just their repair shop.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Their maintenance people.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, we'll see what it it's like.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That tha that can be quite good.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Th this Yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So let's go with that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, I mean we'll see, tomorrow, you know, what it looks like.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, um, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, so he'll be interested in what's going on with that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I guess Was the decision last time was that the the'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Has that started, or is that?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh, it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right, so, the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I did the all that last week.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So all the all the forms are now'",
        "'speaker_C': 'on the computer.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And uh, then I have a bunch of scripts that we'll read those and let the uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'transcribers use different tools.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So he has a nice set up that they it w it will be efficient for them to do that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So anyway'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I I don't think it'll take too long.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, you know, just uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'a matter of a few days I suspect.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So anyway I think we we have at least one uh, user'",
        "'speaker_E': 'for the digits once they get done, which will be Dave.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I've already done five or six sets.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if he wanted to,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, just have a few to start with, he could.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, he might he might be asking'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You know, and I also have a bunch of scripts that will, like, generateP files and run recognition on them also.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, is Dave I don't know if Dave is on the list,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'if he knows.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, no.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, we don't have a active one but I'll make sure he's on the list.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Should we call him?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean is he d is he definitely not available today?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Should I call his office and see?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, well i it's uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'He was in.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, he's still taking classes, so uh, he may well'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'have conflicts.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, he was in s'",
        "'speaker_F': 'He wasn't there at cof'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, so this might be a conflict for him.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, so.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so that that's a minor part of it, I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um I would take them, and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted,'",

        "'speaker_E': 'that said, uh, here's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then they'd hand it back to you.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, but that's our decision then.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub utterance level.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'I think what Morgan's saying is the easier it is, the more is gonna be bleeped.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'And, you know where it's really gonna hurt somebody, in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about,'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So that the'",
        "'speaker_E': 'No, no, I I I don't You you've talked me into that, but I I just think that we should make it harder to do.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The only question is'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Whereas this web interface, I just get email, it's all formatted, it's all ready to go and I can just insert it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well I guess Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So so so I'm sorry so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'You've provided something that's useful for you to do handle, and useful for someone else if they need it.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So th so what I would see, is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the not just for fun,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Um and, uh, and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that's worded, OK?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Then, if someone uh wants to review it,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, and I know you don't like this, but I'm offering this as a suggestion, is that is that we then give them a print out.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then if they say that I have a potential problem with these things, then, you you say OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that, you issue them a password, i in the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But the the problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them, it's inconvenient for me.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I would much prefer to have all be automatic, they visit the web site if they want to.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Obviously they don't have to.'",
