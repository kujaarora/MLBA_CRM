        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But, uh, yeah maybe an agenda, or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well we can start gathering those those ideas, but then we we should firm it up by next next Thursday's meeting.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Will we have time to, um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'to prepare something that we in the format we were planning for the IBM transcribers by then, or?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'he's I I'm sorry, I should have forwarded that along.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, oh I I think I mentioned at the last meeting, he said that, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'he talked to them and it was fine with the beeps they would be'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's easy for them to do.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, uh, oh, though Thi Thilo isn't here, um, but, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I I have the program to insert the beeps.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What I don't have is something to parse the output of the channelized transcripts to find out where to put the beeps, but that should be really easy to do.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So do we have a meeting that that's been done with,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'that we've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to IBM and have them try it out?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'He's he's'",
        "'speaker_A': 'He generated, um, a channel wise presegmented version of a meeting, but it was Robustness rather than EDU so I guess'",
        "'speaker_A': 'depends on whether we're willing to use Robustness?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well for this experiment I think we can use pre pretty much anything.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'This experiment of just'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well we had we had talked about doing maybe EDU as a good'",
        "'speaker_E': 'choice, though.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, whatever we have.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well we've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, maybe it doesn't matter.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'f I I don't think it matte'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I'll I'll I'll, um, get make that available.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK, and has it been corrected?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, well, wait.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hand checked?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Cuz that was one of the'",
        "'speaker_E': 'processes we were talking about as well.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right, so we need to run'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Thilo's thing on it, and then we go in and adjust the boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah that's right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, we haven't done that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And time how long it takes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I I could set someone on that tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think they're coming'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What would be a good number of minutes?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't know, maybe we can figure out how long it'll take'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'to to do.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I don't know, it seems to me w we'",
        "'speaker_E': 'probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting because we'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes except that if they had if there was a choice between'",
        "'speaker_C': 'having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it, and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's just dependent of how much'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Like I I mean I guess if we have to do it again anyway, but, uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I guess, the only thing I'm not sure about is, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, is it pretty easy?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think it's gonna be one or two times real time at Wow, excuse me, two or more times real time, right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Cuz they have to at least listen to it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Can we pipeline it so that say there's, uh, the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we you run it through this other'",
        "'speaker_C': 'other stuff?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well the other stuff isIB.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I'm just thinking that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'from a data'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, so.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'keeping data point of view, it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So the first thing is the automatic thing, and then it's then it's then it's the transcribers tightening stuff up, and then it's IBM.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm, mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and then'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and then, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you would give IBM whatever was'",
        "'speaker_C': 'fixed.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And have them fix it over the entire meeting too?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, yeah, but start from the beginning and go to the end, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if they were only half way through then that's what you'd give IBM.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'As of what point?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to IBM, or do we go ahead and send them a sample?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Why wouldn't we s w i if they were going sequentially through it, why wouldn't'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Let their'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we give them I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well I I I mean, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That was the question.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Though.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if we if we were,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then it seems like giving them something, whatever they had gotten up to, would be better than nothing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That I agree.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I agree.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, I don't think I mean, h they they typically work for what, four hours, something like that?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm, I gue hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think the they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I would think, unless it's a lot harder than we think it is, which it could be, certainly.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'If'",
        "'speaker_A': 'it's got like for speakers then'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I guess I mean if'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Or seven or eight.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We're just doing the individual channels, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Individual channels.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it's gonna be, depending on the number of people in the meeting,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I guess there is this issue of, you know, if if the segmenter thought there was no speech on on a particular stretch, on a particular channel, and there really was,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_A': 'then, if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify, then it might be overlooked, so, I mean, the question is should should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And I th eh so far as I'm concerned it's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point, and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's what it seems to me too, in that if they need to, just like in the other cases, they can listen to the individual, if they need to.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And that cuts down the time.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But they don't have to for most of it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, that's good.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't see how that will work, though.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Good, good, good.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What what aspect?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So you're talking about tightening up time boundaries?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So how do you'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'but you're listening to the mixed signal and you're tightening the boundaries,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'correcting the boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You shouldn't have to tighten them too much because Thilo's program does that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Should be pretty good, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Except for it doesn't do well on short things, remember.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right, so so you'll have to I'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It will miss them.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It will miss most of the really short things.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Like that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But those would be those would be'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh!'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It will it will miss Yeah, you have to say uh huh\" more slowly to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to get c No, I'm s I'm actually serious.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I'll work on that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it will miss stuff like that which'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, so so that's something that the transcribers will have to have to do.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, but presumably, most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section when in which case they'd be listening to the channels anyway.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right, and that's what I'm not sure about.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's that's what I'm I'm concerned about the part.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, I am too.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And I think it's an empirical question.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Can't we uh couldn't we just have, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't know, maybe this just doesn't fit with the software, but I guess if I didn't know anything about Transcriber and I was gonna make something to let them adjust boundaries, I would just show them'",
        "'speaker_B': 'one channel at a time,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh they can'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, but then they have to do'",
        "'speaker_B': 'with the marks, and let them adju'",
        "'speaker_E': 'but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time, and it would probably be more than that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, that's it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Because they'd have to at least listen to each channel'",
        "'speaker_E': 'all the way through.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But i but it's very quick, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And if Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, you scan I mean, if you have a display of the waveform.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, you're talking about visually.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I just don't think'",
        "'speaker_A': 'w Well,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the other problem is the breaths cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I've I've looked at the int uh, s I've tried to do that with a single channel, and and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, and I I think that they're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well that that I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What you the digital what the digital task that you had your interface?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, I know for a fact that one of those sh she could really well she could judge what th what the number was based on the on the waveform.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, that's actually true.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, you're right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You're absolutely right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form I could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, she could tell which one was seven.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um, maybe.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I don't I'm I'm now entirely confused about what they do.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'they're they're looking at a mixed signal, or they're looking what what are they looking at visually?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, they have a choice.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They could choose any signal to look at.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I've tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But I've I've tried looking at the single signal and and in order to judge when it when it was speech and when it wasn't, but the problem is then you have breaths which which show up on the signal.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But the procedure that you're imagining, I mean, people vary from this, is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and they have'",
        "'speaker_C': 'multiple, uh, well, let's see, there isn't'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we don't have transcription yet.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So but there's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically, and those show up on the mixed signal?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'There's a'",
        "'speaker_E': 'N the t'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, they show up on the separate ribbons.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'clicks?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you have a separate ribbon for each channel, and and i i it'll be because it's being segmented as channel at a time with his with Thilo's new procedure, then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins uh across the ribbons uh you could have'",
        "'speaker_C': 'There're separate ribbons.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, so The way you're imaging is they kind of play it, and they see oh this happened, then this happened, then and if it's about right, they just sort of let it slide,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and if it if it there's a question on something, they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, well not not look\".'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, they wouldn't look at it'",
        "'speaker_E': 'at this point.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They would just listen.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'They they might look at it, right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, the problem is that the the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Not very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The problem is that that the Tcl TK interface with'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You can but it takes time.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the visuals, it's very slow to load waveforms.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so when I tried that that was the first thing I tried when I first started it, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, oh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Visually.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You can you can switch quickly between the audio, but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you have to It takes, I don't know, three, four minutes to Well, I mean, it takes it takes long enough'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, it's very slow'",
        "'speaker_A': 'It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the I I don't know exactly what it's doing frankly cuz but it t it takes long enough that it's just not a practical alternative.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to do that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That w'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well it it does some sort of shape pre computation so that it can then scroll it quickly, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But you can cancel that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Oh, really?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Huh!'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Now you could set up multiple windows, each one with a different signal showing,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and then look between the windows.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Maybe that's the solution.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, we we could do different interfaces, right?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'What if you preload them all?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, so so we could use likeX Waves instead of Transcriber,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and it loads faster, certainly.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'What if you were to preload all the channels or or initially like doesn't'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well that's what I tried originally.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I I actually before, uh, Dave Gelbart did this, I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform, but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So you just scroll a screen and it would, you know go kur chunk!'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so it just was not doable with the current interface.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know, I am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers and, you know, you could'",
        "'speaker_A': 'fire up a Transcriber interface for, y you know, in different windows, multiple ones, one for each channel.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And it's sort of a a hack but I mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think that if we decide that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'we need that they need to see the visuals, we need to change the interface so that they can do that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's actually what I thought of, loading the chopped up waveforms, I mean,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you know, that that would make it faster'",

        "'speaker_E': 'But isn't'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The chopped up waveforms.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The problem is if if anything's cut off, you can't expand it from the chopped up'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Isn't that'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right, but if you'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And wouldn't that be the same as the mixed signal?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a at some point'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, I mean the individual channels that were chopped up that it'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those'",
        "'speaker_D': 'short segments.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Cuz you don't really nee like nine tenths of the time you're throwing most of them out, but what you need are tho that particular channel, or that particular location, and,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'might be nice, cuz we save those out already,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to be able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But it won't work for IBM of course, it only works here cuz they're not saving out the individual'",
        "'speaker_D': 'channels.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, I I do think that this this will be a doable procedure, and have them starting with mixed and, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'then when they get into overlaps, just have them systematically check all the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from from audio view.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, hopefully, I mean'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The mixed signal, the overlaps are pretty audible'",
        "'speaker_E': 'because it is volume equalized.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I think they should be able to hear.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The only problem is is, you know, counting how many and if they're really correct or not.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right but but once once you know that they happen, you can at least listen to the close talking, so.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'but you would know that they were there, and then you would switch.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then you would switch into the other'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But right now, to do this limitation, the switching is going to be switching of the audio?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right, so so did Dave'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so they're using their ears to do these markings anyway.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Click'",
        "'speaker_E': 'to listen to the individual channels?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I had suggested it before.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I just don't know whether he did it or not.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I'm not sure what click what click on the ribbon?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, you can get that oh, oh, get you can get the, uh you can get it to switch audio?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, not last I tried, but, um, maybe he's changed it again.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We should get him to do that because, uh, I think that would be much, much faster than going to the menu.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I disagree.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'There's a reason I disagree, and that is that, uh, you it's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'There're times when I wanna hear the mixed signal, bu but I want to transcribe on the single channel.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So right now'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Maybe, I just don't I don't see that it's a'",
        "'speaker_E': 'next to it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Just something so that it's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, I mean, that's the i I I think that might be a personal style thing.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I find it really convenient the way the way it's set up right now.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly well was that Jane, no, was that Chuck, no, was that Morgan\", right now, you have to go up to the menu, and each time, go up to the menu, select it, listen to that channel then click below, and then go back to the menu, select the next one, and then click below.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, it's true.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So you can definitely streamline that with the i with the interface.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, it could be faster, but, you know, I mean, th in the ideal world'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No I I agree that'd be nice.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Done with that?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Does any I forget, does anybody, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'working on any any Eurospeech submission related to this?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I would like to try to do something on digits but I just don't know if we have time.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'So, I'm gonna try, but, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'we'll just have to see.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So actually I wanna get together with both Andreas and, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Stephane'",
        "'speaker_E': 'with their respective systems.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'what what what did it mean for, uh, one of those speakers to be pathological, was it a'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right, and I haven't had s chance to sit down and listen.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, I haven't I haven't listened to them either, but there must be something wrong, I mean, unless our'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I was going to do that this afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, Morgan and I were were having a debate about that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Whereas I think it it's probably something pathologic and actually Stephane's results, I think confirm that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'He s he did'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the Aurora system also got very lousy average error, like fifteen or or, uh, fifteen to twenty percent average?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But then he ran it just on the lapel, and got about five or six percent word error?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So that that means to me that somewhere in the other recordings there are some pathological cases.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'you know, we th that may not be true.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It may be just some of the segments they're just doing a lousy job on.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I'll I'll listen to it and find out since you'd actually split it up by'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'segment.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I can actually listen to it.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'But, yeah, if you take'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I it wasn't'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I can't imagine that'",

        "'speaker_F': 'But'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And so,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so I was curious about that.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'They just plain got it all right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then there and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, you know, it it was zero was the most of them, but then there were the others were sort of decaying from there.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'I wouldn't make that generalization cuz sometimes people will say, And then I\" and there's a long pause and finish the sentence and and sometimes it looks coherent and and the I mean it's it's not a simple problem.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But it's really And then it's coupled with the problem that'",
        "'speaker_A': 'sometimes, you know, with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off and so it's coupled with the problem that Thilo's isn't perfect either.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, we've i th it's like you have a merging problem plus so merging plus this problem of, uh, not y i i if the speech nonspeech were perfect to begin with, the detector, that would already be an improvement, but that's impossible, you know, i that's too much to ask.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'I think that there always th there would have to be some hand tweaking, but it's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I've I've discussed it with Thilo and I mean'",
        "'speaker_A': 'in terms of not him doing it, but we we discussed some of the parameters of that and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean, I guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I forget what KEMAR, uh, stands for, but what it is is it's dummy head that is very specially designed, and and and, so what they're actually doing is they're really there's really two recording systems.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Well, I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked, but I didn't wanna I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because, uh, you know, it was the application was one I didn't know anything about, uh, it just would have been, you know, me getting up to be argumentative, but'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'but, uh, I mean, the missing thi so so what they were saying it's one of these things is you know, all you need is more data, sort of But I mea i wh it that's that's dissing it, uh, improperly, I mean, it was a nice study.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, they were doing this it wasn't word sense disambiguation, it was was it w was it word sense?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, it sort of was.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But it was it was a very simple case of to\" versus too\" versus two\" and there\", their\", they're\"'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so, what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines, and they had different amounts of data, and so they did like, you know, eight different methods that everybody, you know, uh, argues about about, Oh my my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'statistically'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, uh, they were started off with a million words that they used, which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So they went up, being Microsoft, they went up to a billion.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then they had this log scale showing a'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Them being beep, they went off to a billion.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'they well, it's a big company, I didn't I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative, but i i i'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, I think'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the reason they can do that, is that they assumed that text that they get off the web, like from Wall Street Journal, is correct, and edit it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So that's what they used as training data.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's just saying if it's in this corpus it's correct.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But, I mean, yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Of course there was the kind of effect that, you know, one would expect that uh that you got better and better performance with more and more data.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, but the the real point was that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place, and and by by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then by switching learning machines and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture, so, uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That the differences we're seeing in the front end'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'is b are irrelevant once you get a real recognizer at the back end.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Or'",

        "'speaker_B': 'You know?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Huh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, could well be.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So so, I mean, that was that was kind of, you know, it's a good point,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant'",
        "'speaker_C': 'which is not at n t as for as I know in in tasks I'm more familiar with is not at all true.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What i what is is true is that different learning machines have different properties,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and you wanna know what those properties are.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And someone else sort of implied that well we s you know, a all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We don't know them perfectly, but we know that some kinds use more memory and and some other kinds use more computation and some are are hav have limited kind of discrimination, but are just easy to use, and others are'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But doesn't their conclusion just sort of you could have guessed that before they even started?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because'",
        "'speaker_B': 'if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You would guess'",
        "'speaker_B': 'then as you approach there's a point where you can't get any better, right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You get everything right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's just no'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But No, but there was still a spread.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So they're all approaching.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They weren't all up They weren't converging.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They were all still spread.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It w'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But what I'm saying is that th they have to, as they all get better, they have to get closer together.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But they Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But they hadn't even come close to that point.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'All the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But they're all going the same way, right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So you have to get closer.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Eventually.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'O one would'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But they didn't get closer.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh they didn't?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They just switched position.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_C': 'well that's getting cl I mean,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'yeah, the spread was still pretty wide that's th that's true, but but, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case, but, uh, to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different, I mean, I think somebody w w let's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in in Broadcast News, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well it's different for different tasks.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It was Liz.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it depends a lot on whether, you know, it disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You're'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you can assume similar distributions, but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, test data then your training data, then that extra data wouldn't generalize, so.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Because their simplest, most brain dead algorithm did pretty darn well'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'when you got gave it a lot more data.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then also'",
        "'speaker_E': 'they were saying, Well, m You have access to a lot more data.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Why are you sticking with a million words?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, their point was that this million word corpus that everyone uses is apparently ten or fifteen years old.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And everyone is still using it, so.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But anyway, I I I think it's it's just the the i it's it's it's not really the conclusion they came to so much,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'as the conclusion'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that some of the, uh, uh, commenters in the crowd'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'going too far the other way, and and the the, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Machine learning.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'one one person ga g g got up and made a a brief defense, uh, but it was a different kind of grounds, it was that that, uh,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Um, but the other point to make a again is that, uh, machine learning still does matter,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'but it it matters more in some situations than in others, and it and also there's there's not just mattering'",
        "'speaker_C': 'or not mattering, but there's mattering in different ways.'",
