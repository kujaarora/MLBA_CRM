        "'speaker_G': 'um, and this is the time bin'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'better time boundaries and alignments.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I like this idea of uh, for our purposes for the for the IBM preparation, uh, n'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'having these joined together, and uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And in terms of transcription, it would be easy to do it that way.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The way that they have with the longer units, not having to fuss with adding these units at this time.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Whi which could have one drawback.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'If there is uh a backchannel in between those three things,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the the n the backchannel will will occur at the end of of those three.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and in in the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'in the previous version where in the n which is used now, there, the backchannel would would be in between there somewhere, so.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That would be more natural but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, that's that's right, but you know, thi this brings me to the other f stage of this which I discussed with you earlier today, which is the second stage is um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'w what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I discussed this with you too.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, the tr so the idea initially was, we would get uh, for the new meetings, so the e EDU meetings, that Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us, on a channel by channel basis.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And um, so, I've assigned'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I've I've assigned them to our transcribers and um, so far I've discussed it with one, with uh And I had a about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday, we went through uh EDU one, at some extent.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And it occurred to me that um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider it as a staggered mixed file, we had some discussion over the weekend a about at at this other meeting that we were all a at um, about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio, or a mixed channel audio.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And um, in in a way, by by having this this chunk and then the backchannel after it, it's like a stagal staggered mixed channel.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And um, it occurred to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the the maximal gain, it's from the IBM people, may be in long stretches of connected speech.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it's basically a whole bunch of words which they can really do, because of the continuity within that person's turn.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, what I'm thinking, and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this, but but what I'm thinking is that in the EDU meetings, they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then, when when it got s'",
        "'speaker_C': 'patched together when it comes back from IBM, we can add the backchannels.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It seems to me that um, you know, the backchannels per se wouldn't be so hard, but then there's this question of the time'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, marking, and whether the beeps would be uh y y y And I'm not exactly sure how that how that would work with the with the backchannels.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, so um And certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words, taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred, that would be hard.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, m my'",
        "'speaker_C': 'thought is i I'm having this transcriber go through the EDU one meeting, and indicate a start time f for each dominant speaker, endpoi end time for each dominant speaker, and the idea that these units would be generated for the dominant speakers, and maybe not for the other channels.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah the only, um, disadvantage of that is, then it's hard to use an automatic method to do that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The advantage is that it's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, it OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We'll just have to see.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I I think um, you know, the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries, and all that for all the channels but,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, that is so time consuming, and since we have a bottleneck here, we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible, then this seemed to me it'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data, which would be useful when it comes back to us.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh also, at the same time she when she goes through this, she'll be uh If there's anything that was encoded as a pause, but really has something transcribable in it, then she's going to uh, make a mark'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'w uh, so you know, so that that bin would be marked as it as double dots and she'll just add anS.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And in the other in the other case, if it's marked as speech,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and really there's nothing transcribable in it, then she's going to put a s dash, and I'll go through and it and um, you know,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'with a'",
        "'speaker_C': 'with a substitution command, get it so that it's clear that those are'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the other category.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'll just, you know, recode them.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, the transcribable events that um, I'm considering in this,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, continue to be laugh, as well as speech, and cough and things like that, so I'm not stripping out anything, just just you know, being very lenient in what's considered speech.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Jane?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'In terms of the this new procedure you're suggesting, um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'It's not that different.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'u what is the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I'm a little confused, because how do we know where to put beeps?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Is it i d y is it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So what it what it what it involves is is really a s uh,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Transcriber will do it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, the original pr procedure, but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'only applied to uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'a certain strategically chosen s aspect of the data.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We pick the easy parts of the data basically, and transcriber marks it by hand.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You got it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And because'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But after we've done Thilo's thing.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes!'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, after.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes!'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, OK, I didn't I didn't understand that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh yeah!'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, I'm now I'm confused.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We start with your presegmented version'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK, and I'm leaving.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I have to go as well.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So, um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK, leave the mikes on, and just put them on the table.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We start with the presegmented version'",

        "'speaker_B': 'You start with the presegmentation, r'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'yeah?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then um, the transcriber, instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around, and deciding if it's speech or not, but not transcribing anything.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Instead of doing that, which was our original plan,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the tra They focus on the dominant speaker Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'They just'",
        "'speaker_D': 'do that on the main channels.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So what they do is they identify who's the di dominant speaker, and when the speaker starts.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I mean, you're still gonna So we're It's based on your se presegmentation, that's the basic thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And you just'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and you just use the s'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the segments of the dominant speaker then?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'For for sending to to IBM or?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, now Jane, my question is when they're all done adjusting the w time boundaries for the dominant speaker,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'have they then also erased the time boundaries for the other ones?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh No.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, no.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So how will we know who'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Huh uh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'S'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's that's why she's notating the start and end points of the dominant speakers.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, on a you know, so i in EDU one, i as far as I listened to it, you start off with a a s section by Jerry.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So Jerry starts at minute so so, and goes until minute so so.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then Mark Paskin comes in.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And he starts at minute such such, and goes on till minute so so.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then meanwhile, she's listening to both of these guys' channels, determining if there're any cases of misclassification of speech as nothing, and nothing as speech,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and a and adding a tag if that happens.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So she does the adjustments on those guys?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But you know, I wanted to say, his segmentation is so good, that um, the part that I listened to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments of the bins.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'On that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So far we haven't.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So this is not gonna be a major part of the process, at least least not in not on ones that that really Mm hmm?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So if you don't have to adjust the bins, why not just do what it for all the channels?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Why not just throw all the channels to IBM?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well there's the question o of whether'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'She i It's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here'",
        "'speaker_C': 'when she's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from IBM anyway.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if it's only inserting mm\"s here and there,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then, wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end, instead of having it go throughIB, then be patched together, then be double checked here.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But then we could just use the the output of the detector, and do the beeping on it, and send it toIB.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Without having her check anything.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, I guess'",
        "'speaker_B': 'For some meetings, I'm I'm sure it i'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think we just we just have to listen to it and see how good they are.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'n'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm I'm open to that, it was'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, if it's working well, that sounds like a good idea since as you say you have to do stuff with the other end anyway.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's And some on some meetings it's good.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well yea OK, good.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, I mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean the detector, this Now, you were saying that they they differ in how well they work depending on channel s sys systems and stuff.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So we should perhaps just select meetings on which the speech nonspeech detection works well, and just use,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But EDU is great.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'those meetings to to to send to IBM and, do the other ones.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Release to begin with.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'How interesting.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'What's the problem the l I forget.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You know'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Is the problem the lapel, or or'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, it really depends.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, my my'",
        "'speaker_B': 'my impression is that it's better for meetings with fewer speakers, and it's better for'",
        "'speaker_B': 'for meetings where nobody is breathing.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'the dead meetings.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, get That's it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So in fact this might suggest an alternative sort of a a c a hybrid between these two things.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, the undead meeting, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the the one suggestion is you know we we run Thilo's thing and then we have somebody go and adjust all the time boundaries and we send it to IBM.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The other one is we just run his thing and send it to IBM.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'There's a a another possibility if we find that there are some problems, and that is if we go ahead and we just run his, and we generate the beeps file, then we have somebody listen beeps file.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And they listen to each section and say yes, no\" whether that section is'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And erase Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Is intelligible.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'i i intelligible or not.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And it just You know, there's a little interface which will for all the yes\" es then that will be the final'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Blech.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's interesting!'",

        "'speaker_D': 'beep file.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Stress test.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'How interesting!'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean it wouldn't be that much fun for a transcriber to sit there, hear it, beep, yes or no.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Nope.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I I I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But it would be quick.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It would be kind of quick but they're still listening to everything.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But there's no adjusting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And that's what's slow.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'There's no adjusting of time boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, eh, listening does take time too.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I don't know, I I think I'm I'm really tending towards I mean, what's the worst that happens?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Do the transcribers I mean as long as th on the other end they can say there's'",
        "'speaker_F': 'there's something conventions so that they say huh?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah there's I I think there are some meetings where it would would'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah I I think, we won't know until we generate a bunch of beep files automatically, listen to them and see how bad they are.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'That's that's really not not normal.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, cuz the other thing that was concerning me about it was that it seemed kind of specialized to the EDU meeting, and and that then when you get a meeting like this or something, and and you have a b a bunch of different dominant speakers you know, how are you gonna handle it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'They end up on a different channel.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, but, uh, in general I don't think we want them transcribing the background, cuz that would be too much work.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'For it because in the overlap sections, then they'll'",
