        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, uh, so twenty hours.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'And, I think that we're gonna end up with, uh better coverage of the backchannels, but at the same time we're benefitting tremendously from the pre segmentation because there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'PLP, and and the reason PLP has been advantageous in, uh, slightly noisy situations is because,'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto regressive model,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower cepstral coefficients.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, um'",
        "'speaker_I': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'So one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'So right now, we're using a'",
        "'speaker_I': 'I don't know, forty?'",
        "'speaker_I': 'I i it's it's eh'",
        "'speaker_I': 'it's a f training set that's about, um,'",
        "'speaker_I': 'you know, by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'some of these smoothing issues are over fitting for that matter.'",

        "'speaker_I': 'should be much less of a factor, if you go'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Could be.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'And so,'",
        "'speaker_I': 'w so, just um'",
        "'speaker_I': 'so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn around on a smaller training set and then, when you've sort of, narrowed it down, you try it on a larger training set.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'And so, we haven't done that yet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Now the other que related question, though, is is,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, what's the boot models for these things?'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Th th the boot models are trained from scratch.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'So we compute, um'",
        "'speaker_I': 'So, we start with a,'",
        "'speaker_I': 'um,'",

        "'speaker_I': 'So we com we do a, you know, w um'",
        "'speaker_I': 'We collect the uh,'",
        "'speaker_I': 'the observations from those alignments under each of the feature'",
        "'speaker_I': 'sets that that we train.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'And then, from there we do, um There's a lot of, actually The way it works, you first train a phonetically tied mixture model.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'You do a total of First you do a context independent PTM model.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Then you switch to a context You do two iterations of that.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Then you do two iterations of of of context dependent phonetically tied mixtures.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'And then from that you you do the you you go to a state clustered model,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'and you do four iterations of that.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'So there's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'I don't think that'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'We have never seen big differences.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Once I thought oh, I can'",

        "'speaker_I': 'I'll re generate my initial alignments.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Then I'll get much better models at the end.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'Made no difference whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'It's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_I': 'I think it's eh, i the boot models are recur'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, mis for making things better.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But, this for making things worse.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This it migh Th the thought is is is possible another possible partial cause is if the boot models used a comple used a different feature set,'",

        "'speaker_I': 'the result in the end was no different.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'the things that it the data is being viewed in a certain way, uh, that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth, because the actual signal processing you're doing is slightly different.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'it's it's that's probably not it.'",

        "'speaker_I': 'So.'",
