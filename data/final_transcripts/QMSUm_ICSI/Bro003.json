        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No, I'm just saying, I'm just thinking of it like loops, right?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'And you're going through them all.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That that's what I meant.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And, uh, the thing is'",
        "'speaker_F': 'that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'concurrently on different machines, differentSPERTs, and so forth,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth, you can stand back from it and say, OK, if we look at all these combinations we're talking about, and combinations of combinations, and so forth,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you'll probably find you can't do it all.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, so then at that point,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, we should sort out which ones do we throw away.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Which of the combinations across you know, what are the most likely ones, and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And, uh, I still think we could do a lot of them.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But, probably when you include all the combinations, you're actually talking about a thousand of them or something, and that's probably more than we can do.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh, but a hundred is a lot.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And and, uh, um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, and the the second thing was about scratch space.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And I think you sent an email about, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'e scratch space for for people to work on.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And I know that, uh, Stephane's working from an NT machine, so his his home directory exists somewhere else.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Now, we are getting more disk for the central file server,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'since it's not a computational server, would seem to be a contradiction to what I just said.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But the idea is that, uh, suppose you're working with,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, this big bunch of multi multilingual databases.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, you put them all in the central ser at the cen central file server.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Then, when you're working with something and accessing it many times, you copy the piece of it that you're working with over to some place that's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'We're actually gonna get, uh,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But, uh,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'But, uh, are you saying So I don't know where'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you're Stephane, where you're doing'",
        "'speaker_F': 'your computations.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'If i so, you're on an NT machine, so you're using some external machine'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, it, uh'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well, to'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It's Nutmeg and Mustard, I think,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Do you know these yet?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Nuh uh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I'm I've been kind of out of it.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, I think, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I think so.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Unfortunately, these days my idea of running comput of computa doing computation is running a spread sheet.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'haven't been haven't been doing much computing personally, so.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, so those are computational servers.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So I guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, I'm not sure what's available on is it you said Nutmeg and what was the other one?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, Well, you're the you're the disk czar now.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Huh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, I'll check on that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, so basically, uh, Chuck will be the one'",
        "'speaker_F': 'who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where, and so on, and I'll be the one who says, OK, spend the money.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Which, I mean, n these days, uh, if'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you're talking about scratch space, it doesn't increase the, uh, need for backup, and, uh,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I think it's not that big a d and the the disks themselves are not that expensive.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right now it's'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What you can do, when you're on that machine, is, uh, just go to the slash scratch directory,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and do a DF minusK, and it'll tell you'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'if there's space available.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, and if there is then, uh'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But wasn't it, uh I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't'",
        "'speaker_F': 'put stuff in slash scratch.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's more putting in d s XA or XB or, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, there's different there, um, there's'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So there's the slash whatever disks, and then there's slash scratch.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And'",
        "'speaker_A': 'both of those two kinds are not backed up.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And if it's called slash scratch\", it means it's probably an internal disk to the machine.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so that's the kind of thing where, like if um, OK, if you don't have an NT, but you have a a'",
        "'speaker_A': 'a Unix workstation, and they attach an external disk, it'll be called slash something\"'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, if it's not backed up and it'll be slash something\" if it is backed up.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And if it's inside the machine on the desk, it's called slash scratch\".'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But the problem is, if you ever get a new machine, they take your machine away.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'It's easy to unhook the external disks,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'put them back on the new machine, but then your slash scratch is gone.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, you don't wanna put anything in slash scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But if it's a copy of,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'say, some data that's on a server,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you can put it on slash scratch because, um, first of all it's not backed up, and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just recopy it to slash scratch.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So tha that's why I was saying'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you could check slash scratch on those on on, um, Mustard and and Nutmeg to see if'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'if there's space that you could use there.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You could also use slash whatever disks on Mustard and Nutmeg.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, and we do have I mean, yeah, so so you yeah, it's better to have things local'",
        "'speaker_A': 'if you're gonna run over them lots of times so you don't'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right, so es so especially if you're right, if you're if you're taking some piece of the training corpus,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'have to go to the network.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'which usually resides in where Chuck is putting it all on the on the, uh, file server,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, then, yeah, it's fine if it's not backed up because if it g g gets wiped out or something, y I mean it is backed up on the other disk.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, so, one of the things that I need to I've started looking at Uh, is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I've started looking at, um, disk space.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Dan David, um, put a new, um, drive onto Abbott, that's anX disk, which means it's not backed up.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um, I've been going through and copying data that is, you know, some kind of corpus stuff usually, that that we've got on a CD ROM or something, onto that new disk to free up space on other disks.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And, um, so far, um, I've copied a couple of Carmen's,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'databases over there.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We haven't deleted them off of the slash DC disk that they're on right now in Abbott, um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, but we I would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto, um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'this new disk also.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'There's there's a lot more space there, and it'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, anything that that you don't need backed up, we can put on this new disk.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, but if it's'",
        "'speaker_A': 'experiments and you're creating files and things that you're gonna need, you probably wanna have those on a disk that's backed up, just in case something'",
        "'speaker_A': 'goes wrong.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So far I've I've copied a couple of things, but I haven't deleted anything off of'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the old'",
        "'speaker_A': 'disk to make'",
        "'speaker_A': 'room yet.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and I haven't looked at the any of the Aurora stuff, except for the Spanish.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'we think perhaps we can use the the best, uh,'",

        "'speaker_G': 'uh, normalization scheme as OGI is'",
        "'speaker_G': 'using, so, with'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, I think that's a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean it's i i we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So probably if we'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'sort of take their probably the on line line normalization because then it it's if we do anything else, we're gonna end up having to do on line normalization too, so we may as well just do on line normalization.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'i i i it seems to me that'",
        "'speaker_F': 'we wanna do is flush out what you put on the board here.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So what we were just saying is that that, um I was arguing for,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'You can do pretty well.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'uh, clearly there's some limitation to it.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
