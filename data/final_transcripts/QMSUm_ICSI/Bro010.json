        "'speaker_C': 'That's a little bit of a problem.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'What's the allowable?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Ah!'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But, uh, you know, it's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, so they were basically I mean,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'they were more or less trading computation for performance and we were,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, trading latency for performance.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And'",
        "'speaker_C': 'they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't, and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so I think of it as complementary, that if we can put the Complementary.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Think of it as what?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think the best systems'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so, uh, everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system, which is something actually, we've done a lot over the last thirteen years.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'which is we say, well this is the way we should do it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then we do it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then someone else'",
        "'speaker_C': 'does something that's straight forward.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We just, uh, you know, trained up systems'",
        "'speaker_C': 'to be more discriminant.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, uh, we did this, uh, RASTA like filtering which'",
        "'speaker_C': 'was done in the log domain and was tending to handle convolutional noise.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We did we actually did nothing about additive noise.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the, uh, spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think you should be able to end up with a system that's better than'",
        "'speaker_C': 'both but clearly the way that we're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to'",
        "'speaker_C': 'get rid of most of that latency.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we'd have to throw out most of what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And and, uh, I don't think there's any good reason for it in the application actually.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, you're'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you're you're speaking to a recognizer'",
        "'speaker_C': 'on a remote server'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and, uh, having a a a quarter second'",
        "'speaker_C': 'for some processing to clean it up.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It doesn't seem like it's that'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'big a deal.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'These aren't large vocabulary things so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time, and.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And I don't think anybody's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be'",

        "'speaker_C': 'doing things.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, we did the back trace at that point to get the answer.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Of course that didn't take too long at that point.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, no it was pretty quick.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, so you you so you had a'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so you had a a quarter second delay before, uh,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'this w'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And there's physical inertia there, so probably the the motion itself was all'",

        "'speaker_C': 'So, uh, Hans Guenter Hirsch and others have used that kind of method.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And the other thing to do'",
        "'speaker_C': 'is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, determine through magical means that that, uh, there's no speech in some period, and then see what the spectrum is.'",
