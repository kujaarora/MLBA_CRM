        "'speaker_B': 'it'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, easily four times as many'",

        "'speaker_B': 'The silence model expected duration was really different.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so in the case where um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it had a better score, the silence model expected duration was much longer.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it was like it was a better match.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, and it's hard to improve on the on the best case, cuz it's already so good, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah but'",
        "'speaker_F': 'what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on theH HMK's,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'No, it's compared to the word er it's improvement on the word error rate, yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it, in absolute terms,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'We Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'So if there's an overall'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And the variance is just sort of like the next moment, you know?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'I guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside rather than artificial light.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so, in principle, you if you remove that source, then, you know, you can'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So would the major effect is that you're gonna get is by normalizing the means,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'That's the first order but thing, but then the second order is is the variances'",

        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'because, again, if you if you're trying to distinguish betweenE andB if it just so happens that theE's were a more you know, were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something, or the variation in it was larger,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh than with theB's, then this will be give you some some bias.'",
