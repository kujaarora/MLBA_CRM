        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",

        "'speaker_B': 'not not not much.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or even I was thinking about uh looking back into these totally ad hoc techniques like for instance uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Dennis Klatt was suggesting'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh the one way to'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh deal with noisy speech is to add noise to everything.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm!'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'to all data.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a'",
        "'speaker_B': 'effective, right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because you already'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh had the noise uh in a'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And it was working at the time.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It was kind of like one of these things, you know, but if you think about it, it's actually pretty ingenious.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So well, you know, just take a take a spectrum and and and add of the constant,C, to every every value.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well you're you're basically y'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So you're making all your training data more uniform.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Exactly.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'clean recognition goes down, but I mean yet to be seen how much, it's a very simple technique.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yes indeed it's a very simple technique, you just take your spectrum and and use whatever is coming from FFT,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'add constant,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you know?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'That that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum, what you can s start doing, you can leave start leaving out'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the p the parts which are uh uh low in energy'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but the truth is'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But you have many of those vectors per phoneme, right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, so you get many decisions.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then you can start dec thinking about how to combine these decisions.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Exactly, that's what yeah, that's what it is.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'How wide are the uh frequency bands?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's another thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well c currently we start I mean we start always with critical band spectrum.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'For various reasons.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But uh the latest uh observation'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh is that you you you are you can get quite a big advantage of using two critical bands at the same time.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yes, yes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'But now we are trying to understand what this vector actually represents, for instance a question is like how correlated are the elements of this vector?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'especially the neighboring ones, right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
