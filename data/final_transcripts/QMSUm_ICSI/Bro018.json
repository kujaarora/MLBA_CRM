        "'speaker_C': 'And something different in some fundamental way.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'log FFT'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh log power uh'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so the filter bank'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Maybe.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I think that, for me, the thing that that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here, so here's here's an idea.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh What about it you skip all the all the really'",
        "'speaker_C': 'clever things,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Ah I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'This is f You have the log magnitude spectrum, and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and and c c computing the variance.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's a clever thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What if you stopped being clever?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And you just took this thing in here because it's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'figure out what they can what they most need from things, and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean that's what they're good at.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I mean you're you're you're trying to be clever and say what's the statistic that should we should get about this difference'",
        "'speaker_C': 'but uh in fact,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know maybe just feeding this in or or feeding both of them in'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, another way, saying let it figure out what's the what is the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'interaction, especially if you do this over multiple frames?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Then you have this over time,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and and both kinds of measures and uh you might get uh something better.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So so don't uh don't do the division, but let the net'",
        "'speaker_E': 'have everything.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's another thing you could do yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, it seems to me, if you have exactly the right thing'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then it's better to do it without the net because otherwise you're asking the net to learn this you know, say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into a net'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and have a bunch of nonlinearities in the middle and train it to get the product of the output and it would work.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But, it's kind of crazy, cuz we know how to multiply and you you'd be you know much lower error'",
        "'speaker_C': 'usually'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if you just multiplied it out.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But suppose you don't really know what the right thing is.'",
