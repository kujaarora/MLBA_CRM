        "'speaker_F': 'Well it's not that so much as that, you know, e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and, you know, people's jobs would get delayed, so it's sort of a sharing thing.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run, um, you'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use run command\", uh, to only have ten of those going at a time.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Just doP make.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'If you Run command\", that I mentioned before, is doesn't know about other things that you might be running.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once, and they wouldn't know about each other.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But if you useP make, then, it knows about all the jobs that it has to run'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and it can control, uh, how many it runs simultaneously.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So run command\" doesn't useP make, or?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It uses export\" underlyingly.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But, if you i It's meant to be run one job at a time?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So you could fire off a thousand of those, and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So why would one use that rather thanP make?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, if you have, um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Like, for example, uh if you didn't wanna write aP make script and you just had a, uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh, six hours to run,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and somebody's using, uh, the machine you typically use, you can say run command\" and your HTK thing and it'll find another machine, the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, there are um Right.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'And if you specify that,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So which can cause you to lose time, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'If you had a two hour job, and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Um, what what about I remember always used to be an issue, maybe it's not anymore, that'",

        "'speaker_A': 'uh, mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so, instead of using this,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh, I got new filters.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that seems to be giving'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Slightly.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'not very significantly.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'uh, showing any improvement over final by plugging in an LDA.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And uh, so then after after that I I added uh, on line normalization also on top of that.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'But um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot, I just t g I just found that I have to reduce the value I mean, I have to increase the time constant, or reduce the value of the update value.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And uh,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, the other other thing what I tried was, I just um,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, can you back up a second, I I I missed something, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I guess my mind wandered.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Ad ad When you added the on line normalization and so forth, uh, uh things got better again?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'No.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'so,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'oh yeah So I just stopped there with the uh, speech enhancement.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The the other thing what I tried was the adding the'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I see.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so one difference is that, I guess you were taking spectra.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'or?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, if we are using our own code for th'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean that that could be the only difference.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, there is no other difference.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'So I'm trying to understand it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, well I think we should uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I th'",
        "'speaker_D': 'have a table with all the result because I don't know I uh, I don't exactly know what are your results?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, but so we did this, and another difference I guess is that we just applied'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, proposal one system after this without'",
        "'speaker_D': 'well,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters, and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh huh.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Af I after that I added on line normalization, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So we just tried directly to to'",
        "'speaker_D': 'just, keep the system as it was'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, when we plug'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the spectral subtraction it improves uh, signif significantly.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, but, what seems clear also is that we have to retune the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'time constants of the on line normalization.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Because if we keep the value that was submitted'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, it doesn't help at all.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You can remove on line normalization, or put it, it doesn't change anything.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, uh, as long as you have the spectral subtraction.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But, you can still find'",
        "'speaker_D': 'some kind of optimum somewhere, and we don't know where exactly but,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, I assume.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something and see where i where the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
