        "'speaker_B': 'we can't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that's I mean, in the past we've looked at, uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and this is hard enough, the interaction between channel effects'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and and, uh and additive noise, uh, so convolutional effects and and additive effects.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that's hard enough.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, I don't think we really I mean, we're trying to deal with that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'In a sense that's what we're trying to deal with in this Aurora task.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And we have, uh, the, uh,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And we have the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'noise suppression that's doing something about noise.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, even that's hard enough.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And and the on line normalization as well, in that s category.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'i i There's all these interactions between these two and that's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But now when you throw in the reverberation, it's even worse, because not only do you have these effects, but you also have some long time effects.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, um, so Dave has something which,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it's when there's noise there too, it's it's it's pretty hard.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So we have to start'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Since any almost any real situation is gonna have uh, where you have'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, um'",

        "'speaker_C': 'a TRAP for each one of the phonemes, um, times fifteen, for each of the fifteen critical bands.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, um, she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically, um, is a clustering algorithm that, uh, starts with many, many, many different points many different clusters uh, corresponding to the number of data, uh, patterns that you have in the data.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'and, um, I was thinking about ways to to generalize this because w you're it's sort of like a it's not a completely automatic way of clustering, because yo beforehand you have these these TRAPS and you're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, and that's that's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'They're both orthogonalizing.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, so the common right, the common wisdom is you can't do words because there's too many of them, right?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'it's it's, you know it'",
        "'speaker_E': 'No, but I think the important part in there is that, you know, if you want to be discriminative, you have to have'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, you know, categories.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Now, that being said, I think that that if you have something'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'If you have read speech that's been manually annotated, like TIMIT,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'then, you know, i i you the phones are gonna be right, actually, for the most part.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So so, uh,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh, you know, it's gonna be based on'",
        "'speaker_B': 'bad pronunciation models that you have of'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and, um And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So it's almost like there's this mechanism that we have that, you know, when when we're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there'",
        "'speaker_E': 'you know, we we deal with that, but but when we go to conversational, and then all of a sudden'",

        "'speaker_E': 'how to build that in.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, I mean, I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is'",
        "'speaker_B': 'pretty intuitive, but start looking at'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, what are the kinds of confusions that you do make,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, you know, between words if you want or or or, uh, even phones in in in in read speech, say,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'You know, so is it more across place or more across manner?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And if that if that is if it uh, if that turns it into another word or or different you know, or another pair of words or something,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'then it's more likely to happen.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But, um,'",
