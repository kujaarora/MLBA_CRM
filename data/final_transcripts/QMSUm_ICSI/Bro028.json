        "'speaker_B': 'You've you've got some,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, compression.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We always have some compression.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We always have some you know, the the the kind of filter bank with a kind of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'quasi log scaling.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, if you put in if you also include the RASTA in it i RASTA the filtering being done in the log domain has an AGC like, uh, characteristic, which, you know, people typi typically put in these kind of,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, auditory front ends.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it's very, very similar,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, but it's not exactly the same.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different but,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, it's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, for instance, if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you know, basically what they do is they they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And those filters have different, uh, kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so in fact they're multi scale.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But, they're not sort of systematically multi scale, like let's start here and go to there, and go to there, and go to there\", and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It's more like, you run it on this, you do discriminant analysis, and you find out what's helpful.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I it's multi scale because you use several of these in parallel, is that right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'They use several of them.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Of OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, I mean, you don't have to but but but, uh, Hynek has.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, but it's also, uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hyn when Hynek's had people do this kind of LDA analysis, they've done it on frequency direction and they've done it on the time direction.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously some twoD and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, but I don't think they've done that much of that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, uh, the other thing that's interesting the the, uh the feature selection thing, it's a simple method, but I kinda like it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, there's a a old, old method for feature selection.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, eh, uh, I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago, so I know it's pretty old,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis in which you which I think it's used in social sciences a lot.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, you you you you pick the best feature.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you take y you find the next feature that's the best in combination with it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then so on and so on.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And what what Michael's describing seems to me much, much better,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know, if you've'",
        "'speaker_B': 'picked the right'",
        "'speaker_B': 'set of features.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Just because something's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, uh, here at least you're starting off with all of them,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and you're throwing out useless features.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think that's that seems, uh that seems like a lot better idea.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, you're always looking at things in combination with other features.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so the only thing is, of course, there's this this artificial question of of, uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'exactly how you how you a how you assess it and if if your order had been different in throwing them out.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, it still isn't necessarily really optimal, but it seems like a pretty good heuristic.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I th I think it's it's I think it's kinda neat stuff.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And and and, uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi stream way.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so so that, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'when you come up with these different things,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and these different functions,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but perhaps you'",
        "'speaker_B': 'have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream, and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And we've also talked a little bit about, uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, Shihab Shamma's stuff, in which'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you the way you look at it is that there's these different mappings and some of them emphasize, uh, upward moving,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, energy and fre and frequency.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And some are emphasizing downward and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'fast things and slow things and and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So there's a bunch of stuff to look at.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But, uh, I think we're sorta gonna start off with what'",
        "'speaker_B': 'he, uh, came here with and branch out branch out from there.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'As as we were talking about this I was thinking,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um, whether there's a relationship between um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'between Michael's approach to, uh, some some sort of optimal brain damage or optimal brain surgeon on the neural nets.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, like, if we have, um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'we have our we have our RASTA features and and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, from the the the features to to this this probability posterior space.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And, um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and each of the hidden units is learning some sort of some sort of'",
        "'speaker_E': 'some sort of pattern.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And it could be, like like these, um these auditory patterns that Michael is looking at.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then when you're looking at the the, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the best features,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'you know, you can take out'",

        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, y actually, you make me think a a very important point here is that, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'if we a again try to look at how is this different from what we're already doing,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, there's a a, uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'a nasty argument that could be made th that it's it's not different at at all,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'because, uh if you ignore the the selection part'",
        "'speaker_B': 'because we are going into a a very powerful,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, nonlinearity that, uh, in fact is combining over time and frequency,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and is coming up with its own you know, better than Gabor functions its, you know, neural net functions, its whatever it finds to be best.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh, I I know that i sometimes it's useful to to constrain things.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's why it really seems like the constraint in in all this stuff it's the constraints that are actually what matters.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because if it wasn't the constraints that mattered, then we would've completely solved this problem long ago, because long ago we already knew how to put waveforms into powerful statistical mechanisms.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, I agree.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, that's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'There's the problem.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Then it would work.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But but, I mean, i it's With finite of those things I mean, uh, we we have done experiments where we literally have put waveforms in and and and, uh, we kept the number of parameters the same and so forth, and it used a lot of training data.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And it and it it, uh not infinite but a lot, and then compared to the number parameters and it it, uh it just doesn't do nearly as well.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, anyway the point is that you want to suppress it's not just having the maximum information, you want to suppress,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, the aspects of the input signal that are not helpful for'",
        "'speaker_B': 'for the discrimination you're trying to make.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So maybe just briefly, uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, that sort of segues into what what I'm doing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'so, uh, the big picture is k um, come up with a set of, uh, intermediate categories, then build intermediate category classifiers, then do recognition, and, um, improve speech recognition in that way.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um, so right now I'm in in the phase where I'm looking at at, um, deciding on a initial set of intermediate categories.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And I'm looking for data data driven methods that can help me find, um, a set of intermediate categories of speech that, uh, will help me to discriminate later down the line.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And one of the ideas, um, that was to take a take a neural net'",
        "'speaker_E': 'train train an ordinary neural net to uh, to learn the posterior probabilities of phones.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so, um, at the end of the day you have this neural net and it has hidden hidden units.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And each of these hidden units is um, is learning some sort of pattern.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so, um, what what are these patterns?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um, and I'm gonna to try to to look at those patterns to to see, um, from those patterns uh, presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And maybe maybe some, uh, intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um, that the neural net learns.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Be before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there's there's a a pretty nice'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'relationship between what you're talking about doing and what you're talking about doing there.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it seems to me that, you know, if you take away the the the difference of this'",
        "'speaker_B': 'primary features,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and, say, you use as we had talked about maybe doing you useP RASTA PLP or something for the the primary features,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, then this feature discovery, uh, uh, thing'",
        "'speaker_B': 'is just what he's talking about doing, too, except that he's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond'",
        "'speaker_B': 'to these uh, uh, what these'",
        "'speaker_B': 'sub features are are are are showing you.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the other difference is that, um, he's doing this in a in a multi band setting,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'which means that he's constraining himself to look across time in some f relatively limited, uh, uh, spectral extent.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And whereas in in this case you're saying let's just do it unconstrained\".'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So they're they're really pretty related and maybe they'll be at some point where we'll'",
        "'speaker_B': 'see the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the connections a little better and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'connect them.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, so so that's the that's the first part uh, one one of the ideas to get at some'",
        "'speaker_E': 'some patterns of intermediate categories.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um, the other one was, um, to, uh, come up with a a a'",
        "'speaker_E': 'model um, a graphical model,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'that treats the intermediate categories as hidden hidden variables, latent variables, that we don't know anything about, but that through, um, s statistical training and the EM algorithm, um, at the end of the day, we have, um we have learned something about these these latent, um latent variables which happen to correspond to intermediate categories.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, and so those are the the two directions that I'm I'm looking into right now.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I guess that's that's it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It's kind of like, you know, the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's ri'",
