Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Um f frequencies or something'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be '",
        "'Marketing': 'Um .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I don't know . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It does make sense from maybe the design point of viewcause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So , possibly .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Just a chara just a characteristic of the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Just  Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Aye , I see what you mean , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'something like that , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Marketing . Good marketing thoughts .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'thinking ,kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'something other than just standard . Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the  thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh-huh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Or no , is it as much as that ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yep . Yeah , I'd say so , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No . Yeah , yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um right , okay . Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? Thin'",
        "'Marketing': 'Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No , actually . That would be useful , though ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'other  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh . Five minutes to end of meeting .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It just comes along .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh , okay . We're a bit behind .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Do you know what I mean ?'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I know um  My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But  Right . Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So um for them it was just how many devices control .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay so  Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think so .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'everything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'such as the lighting in your house , or um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities .'",
        "'Marketing': 'An Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But each one's got its own little part .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And you keep losing them .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You keep losing them .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Finding them is really a pain , you know .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm . Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'or it's kicked under the table .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You know .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's just really good id Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'There  I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh , '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Dunno .'",
        "'Marketing': 'sure . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay maybe . '",
        "'Marketing': 'I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_'",
        "'Marketing': 'and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'My goodness .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Still feels quite primitive .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe like a touch screen or something ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Something like that , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer .'",
        "'Marketing': ''Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having '",
        "'Project Manager': 'It looks better .'",
        "'Marketing': 'You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um , nicer materials'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'be worth exploring anyway .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Right , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually  what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess .  And uh and that's the end of the meeting . So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so '",
