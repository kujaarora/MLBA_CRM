        "'Industrial Designer': ''S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so in that sense '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , sure .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so it does kind of make sense , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , well '",
        "'Marketing': 'It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of  talking about action and design as opposed to background .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Everything I have is kinda background .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay we all ready to go ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well how um on the  in this meeting then if we um  I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . And we uh decided on'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,'",
        "'Marketing': ' Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um  . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . Um so that was the last meeting .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Is there anything  have I forgotten anything ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Is that everything ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh that sounds  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of  that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . That might be a better idea this time .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sure .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'if that's alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sure .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , cool .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So if you wanna take this .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Why don't I get that  ? Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Screwed in quite tightly . Uh what did  uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We  did we say we were gonna try  maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Right . Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So um  that's kind of the end result hopefully .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ?'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Uh-huh . Hopefully appear in a wee second .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm . Come on . I think it's working .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Up there we go .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay great s so let me just start this .  Okay great . So um  uh s move on . Uh-huh  oh where'd it all go ?'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Oh no .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's not good . Okay lemme just see where I can find it . This looks more like it . I think I just opened up the template .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh right .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sorry about that . Okay alright so let's have a look here .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Here we go .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see  sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Aye a fair point definitely .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um  quite user friendly while still having technology . So it  I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um  what we should think about is how the um  about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Aye right .'",
        "'Marketing': 'For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'because obviously the thing that  the message here is ease of use . So how do you make innovation make something more  more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um  that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'do you know what I mean ? So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . Umcause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um  so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think that would be pushing it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is  which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . Um  So these this is the summary of everything . Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen  it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . That was like the number three thing . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm that's true , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'You know what a Mac iPod is ? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of  or more of like a   maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um  techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a  I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um  Does that make sense ? Yeah . So  so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea ,cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their  what people associate this  them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mmkay . Great .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So anyway it's just just an idea .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um   into something which is  which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'How can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Anyway those are  that's all I have ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's great .'",
        "'Marketing': 'but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh . Okay great .'"

    "Presentation on the conceptual design": [
        "'Project Manager': 'Um thank you for that . Uh Craig do you wanna'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'uh plug yours in then ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Is it working ?'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Mm . Not quite .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Did you press F_ eight ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's probably not sending . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh something coming now , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep , there it is .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'There we go .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And so think of this concept . Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um  So then this  we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . Um they're not very attractive to look at ,  and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're  I just holdem like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . Um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be . It's uh something the user then uh identify with . This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control  um I getem with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that  um   The buttons should be large . They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . They should be easy to press , very comfortable .  Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um  there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . Um should avoid s things like that . Um  if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ?'",
        "'Project Manager': ' I think it's yellow'",
        "'Marketing': 'I didn't know .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow ,'",
        "'Marketing': ' Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And the Play-Dohs yellow  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Fantastic . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'but keep going'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and we'll discuss it after .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the   um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Um if we did decide to go for voice activation  there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or  Um  we should definitely avoid the big square block look . That's just wrong .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mmkay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department ,  and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Aye that's a good idea , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and  possibility . Right and these are problems I've had with it . Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . I think it's um , fashion into electronics .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'huh ? Just um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oops .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah okay . Let me just get this going first .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Ah there it is . '",
        "'Marketing': ' It takes a second , doesn't it ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''Kay , that should be it . Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and well either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . Um the components are exactly the same .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said  we've defined , like we only want the basic things that  to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . So um you know it's just a matter of working out space .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . So just go through it in the components . Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thingcause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So maybe if you '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'well I could see the other email that they sent you , umcause they got back to me with like different requirements  , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'okay there's an L_C_D_ display ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' um I think these are quite standard things .'",
        "'Marketing': 'They're standard , aren't they ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No um they're  well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , um but um'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We  you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't  I'm not very sure about the titanium .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mmkay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about sizecause they should be about the same size .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Power consumption should be about the same . Um I think the main impact is complexity ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'um and the other thing is um the power options . Um the first one is a standard battery . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up  you know , a crank  .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' I'll clear one of these things for you . Just by moving it yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah but that that might be something   I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a batterycause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it  um so .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Um  The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .  Um the case  okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Uh question on  can I ask a question ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so  but yeah you c ask away .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Can we uh power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'Illuminate the buttons . Yeah it glows . Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Right , okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so um it's a bit nuts to get the  Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'I think that would make it very complex .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm not real'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We have the option of the speaker as well  the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Nah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'no um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You could put a game on it  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No ? '",
        "'Marketing': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Easy  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay um right'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'B um I think the  we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay right um what else do you need to talk about ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well i I was just '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Where would you physically position the buttons ? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . Um energy what  do you think that's suggesting we're  how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , sure .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I mean what does anybody think about that ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just '",
        "'Marketing': 'and watches yeah  Sure , okay , right , okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Support for it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean just  it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . I've also known people to have  things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So we should think about '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So you'd have the battery as the kind of  to keep it ticking over idea '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Chip on print , is that  that's an industrial design thing , is it David ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that '",
        "'Marketing': 'And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of  Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah I think so yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um just a a lot of the um   I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mmkay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme  like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ?'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like  Okay so so backlighting , that would be good .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Or even a clear case . Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah clear ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Aye that would be a good idea .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but in the dark it sort of , it's alive  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah sure .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um in in a slight subtle way .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that'd be really good .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sure .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So the power  the battery in that sense ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'that sort of '",
        "'Marketing': 'Sure . Yeah they they emanate a light through it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Lights .'",
        "'Marketing': ''Kay . Yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'mm-hmm . Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled ,cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'Or '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Do you wantem to roll it like that ? Do you wantem to roll it like that ?Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it ,'",

        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
