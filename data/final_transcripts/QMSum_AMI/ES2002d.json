Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . Anything I've missed ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'That's it .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , ach that's a shame .  Um right , so take away that completely ? Ah . And now we're under budget . So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted .'",
        "'User Interface': ' So I reckon '",

So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here .

        "'Marketing': 'Sorry . Huh . Yeah . Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme ,'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'you know , innovative thought with . In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your  the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a  quite a con confining framework to work within . And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh , okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , got the email .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'well that's what teamwork is . To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'anything was pretty un f  unsupportive ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Yeah . And point at ? Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and and and in a way everybody's  as we discuss things in the  in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just  we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . It wasn't until we had this here , you know ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinkingcause I saw his book .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Think could be , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'umca you know , justcause that's sorta how we  what we were set up to to use while we had our time .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay uh '",
