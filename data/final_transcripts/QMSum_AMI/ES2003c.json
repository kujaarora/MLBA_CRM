I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick ,  L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . Um we were also going to use  novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . Um that pretty much sums up the last one . So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible .'",

Uh but later on  we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . So uh we decide what it's gonna be . Probably plastic . Uh we need the infra-red transmitter . Get that off the shelf . Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um  if you go on to the next slide . Uh   If you go on to f uh findings , it's like two or three slides down .'",

Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . So you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . Um  if you want the buttons to be  oh yeah , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . But  you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . So um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . Do you think ?'",

If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . So that's just how the control works inside . Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um  I think we can do it if  uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ .'",

Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if  so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . Um so uh next slide , if you please . Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um  v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f  and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um'",

So it's not  I'm not really excessively concerned about that . You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right  left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people .

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,kay basically um   I can add pretty pictures to this . The um  Assuming the hand  the hand to be in about sort of this position , um  hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . Um and it would need t there would need to be a  it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . So . You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . You just have big  two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can  in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . Um , and that '",
        "'Marketing': 'Is this the joystick ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Th  this part here is the joystick . This would be the actual grip . Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'That would be probably the bulkiest part . And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . So it would fit just nicely in the hand . And again , this part could be rotated , so it can   So  so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . Um  So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . Um now programming it  actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some  some fair iv  fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you  on your  computer just so that you could um pr  program it at a rather  in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you  i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a  ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet .

As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know .  They want it to be  that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . Technology technical  technologically innovative . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . So like the interface is really important .  And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important  I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . People want it  I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use ,  prefer it to have the newest features . And if it's easy to use that's a bonus .  The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . How that relates to a remote control I don't know .'",

But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's that's different , you know , that's  everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . Like , titanium is cool but it's expensive . And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . Um  I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for  it's the up to the interface guy . So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like , I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . So I think cool is the key .  Few questions about a spongy remote control . I've never seen one before . I've seen plastic remote controls . I think maybe they were  I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being'",

So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . So how do things fit it ? And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus  doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg . We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . People like spongy material . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . And also , this was this year .

        "'User Interface': 'I th uh I mean if it  I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . Um .'",
        "'Marketing': 'S oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well basi  basically the um for  f for uh  I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic  will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's not simply a matter of frequency .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So um  usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi  you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and try the different codes that'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'come under that manufacturer's nametil you find the right one .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , that's right .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and then they maybe look up different names of um  different actual units that have been produced .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um booklet .  Some pages .'",
        "'Marketing': ' I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , so'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Doesn't have to be used very often'",

        "'Project Manager': 'that's right , yeah .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': ' If you  if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's  that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . Um mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , this   just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . This is the conceptual one . Um . I think we've come up  I think we've covered everything we need to here . Um I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . Um  So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stagecause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um looking from   prototyping of some des description using clay . Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh  progress . Um  The user interface design , They're kind of  it looks they're  the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas  possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are  are made , I would say . Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm , that's very true .  Um . Okay . Um got product evaluation as well . Um .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , you see I don't  some of these things kinda logically follow the others . How can  t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' I I think we'd be  yeah , no , it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh , that's the  okay , sure sure sure .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay , sure . At this stage we still have no no target audience or '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous .'",
        "'Marketing': ''Kay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um  the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying'",
        "'Marketing': 'And it's stylish .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yep . Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Think that's well within the normal bracket . Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit upcause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . That one might have to be based on '",
        "'Marketing': 'Programmable memory as well .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The U_S_B_ for which ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'For the remote control .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh right , okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . Um .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We've w definitely talking some type of '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna '",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's just for T_V_ , but for'",
        "'Marketing': 'Different .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'We don't know unless  it would make sense to .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha  it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um f  for one  for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be um o ought to be customisable and uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . W'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm . How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sure .  I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open  it is supposed to be international , right ? So .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It would make sense to . I would say to .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It would make sense if you could '",

        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so . Um . I would say yeah . International would make sense . Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' So um'",

        "'Industrial Designer': ' they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Mm .  I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . '",
