        "'Project Manager': ' Jesus .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . And what we got was , we found that  if you  uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available  uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Excellent .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Then   And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . So we have to take care of this fact also . Then . Uh it was function I want to go to .'",

And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so  uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",

        "'User Interface': 'um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . '",
        "'User Interface': 'If you find if y'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'What you could do then would be you have uh  a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote ,cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That we should just stick on , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'which '",
        "'User Interface': 'That comes with our remote control .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right , right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right , right . Um .  Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' It might do us out of a job .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Um  Okay .  I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . Um so I think rather than  and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that ,'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so I th'",

        "'Project Manager': 'yeah and expense and the time .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So I think if we're going to go  well I mean like the thing about the  there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . Um   uh  and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? Is that '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe not even all of itcause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Contrast contra well .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'um which is where I usually find mine .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um   Okay , well we can use  we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'um if we're gonna have to '",
        "'User Interface': ''cause what I thought , main '",

        "'User Interface': 'Slogan , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Right . Mm-hmm .Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um  uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .'",
        "'User Interface': 'That was more of a a gimmick .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Do you think ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , unnecessary . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Um , okay so scratch that . Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the  is that far too expensive ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around ,'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'They're pretty fragile .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um no , I mean  that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . Um   Uh  So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . Um .  So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah mm .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'um expensive ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah you think so ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'like a '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh right , okay .'",
