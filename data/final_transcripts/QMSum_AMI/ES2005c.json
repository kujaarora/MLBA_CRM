        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .  Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way   We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our  uh in our findings we have seen that  when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take  in designing our rem uh remote controls .'",

        "'Project Manager': ''Kay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'what do we think ? Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Organic sponge . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um  Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah so '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um  so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic  initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex '",
        "'User Interface': 'I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh right , okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I don't know what that stuff is . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So something with give to it .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Okay . And'",
        "'User Interface': 'And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and the colour is yellow , right ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or at least incorporating , yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'y  yellow incorporated , yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh  I don't know what other standard silver kind of '",
        "'User Interface': 'I think '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Other parts or uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Yeah , the buttons w like ,cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm' kay .'",

        "'User Interface': 'You do have ones like um play  could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Makes it easy to use . Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .  Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel  I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'a bit comfier , you know .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Like uh  an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be  that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'or just like a  It's not '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'What about a banana ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' We could make novelty remote controls .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , yeah , I mean like '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''cause it's yellow fruit ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'right ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , yeah . Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . But then how would you point it ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess .'",
        "'User Interface': 'What '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah , I appreciate this idea ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'They only cost pennies .'",
        "'Marketing': 'because then this   this will help us in our advertisement also'",
        "'Marketing': 'and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , so this w this w'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Huh ?'",
        "'User Interface': ' y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Um .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So a spongy banana re '",
        "'Project Manager': ' I mean that that th '",
        "'User Interface': 'Rubber banana .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'does'",
        "'User Interface': ' Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . '",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables ,'",
        "'Project Manager': ' S'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'See '",
        "'Marketing': 'like people uh now '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And sponginess .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable'",
        "'User Interface': 'And spongy , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Spongy .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'like so it would have a stem perhaps'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and a'",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'maybe a  it'd be s axially symmetric .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Huh .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Like what's what's that  , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like  looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it'd look like this kinda .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , that's what I was thinking .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , maybe that's what they are .'",
        "'User Interface': ''Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'and '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah , why the hell not .  Let's  that'll make us fifty million Euros .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I don't know . What do you guy  What do you think ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'No .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'yeah ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , then only we can relate it with something .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Exactly .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ?'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh-huh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'There's a good man . There's a good idea .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We'll uh  Okay , we could do that . Um .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay . And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , so'",
        "'Project Manager': 'They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'things that are always used .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , just like that .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' That's cool .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' I like it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'With the scroll-wheel or no ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay uh I could put the microphone here . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay there's the microphone .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Where should I put the microphone ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Glad , we're not doing this for real .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um yeah , I can  no I'm not sure .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'I couldn Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is  the microphone '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's  Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''Kay there's the mic .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So it can be sort of held and w  '",
        "'User Interface': 'That's cool .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um n well we can  Whoops . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oops . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So let's not use the whiteboard any more . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Um .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Upsidaisy . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oops , sorry . Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And uh so what else was there ? Um the '",
        "'User Interface': 'What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?'",
        "'Project Manager': ' I s I still like it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Are we just gonna leave that ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um but that's me . '",
        "'User Interface': 'You still like it .Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes .'",
        "'User Interface': ''Cause um it could  Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um don't wanna sort of overkill .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Especially with yellow  .  Mm . I dunno .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Cause I mean like uh if we  I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? '",
        "'User Interface': ' Then you put it in the fruit bowl ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': '   They can work from a '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , you know , and then you just tal'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You don't have to hold it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers ,'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Um . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'you know they have uh fruits all round them .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Now just make sure they don't eat the remote .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I mean uh  some uh I'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , do we need buttons ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then it's just apple so sort of '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh , yellow apples though  Hmm . '",
        "'User Interface': 'I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uhcause that could sit on its own and it's quite  got a quite steady base .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay . But yeah '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Groovy .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um'",
        "'User Interface': 'and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ,  . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It can sit at a distance and pick it up still .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . So  I mean like you could actually '",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or we can '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , gives you the options .'",
        "'Marketing': 'we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So a selection of casings .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'it will look l  Uh yeah . In that w'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,cause you said about disposable ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'S s sorry ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'didn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'so we could do that , like have a choice . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Like like mobiles , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put  we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'without  uh yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'We still need the buttons in the same places thought ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .'",
        "'User Interface': 'don't we ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You can standardise those , I mean .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'so half of that will be look the '",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of  from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay , okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''cause when  if you think about it if they're wanting it ,cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You knowcause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it ,'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'unless you have sort of  you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': '  Okay , um so '",
        "'Project Manager': ' So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 's I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and the colours we got down ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Well , um because  Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because  what '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , so we stick with what we've got there .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , w I think wh wha would  we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a  too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mmkay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . '",
        "'User Interface': 'I mean we could make it nice pale yellow .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'colour , but have '",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'kinda going round , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um I mean e even if '",
        "'User Interface': 'Because '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'W sort of '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Great .  Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ? '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda  powers it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right , it's like those watches that you c'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh , a d a dynamo ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah ,  .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah , I like that , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
