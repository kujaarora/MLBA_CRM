        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It does look very cool .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um then'",
        "'Project Manager': ' then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then I need to say some st a few things about finance ,cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then do we get to make a remote control ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Is that right ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'until about four fifteen . So yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Okay , so .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Go for it . Do you want '",
        "'User Interface': 'So , you said um  are are we starting with the the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Presentation .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Okay .  Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and   we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .'",
        "'Marketing': ' You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Um  '",
        "'Marketing': 'It's a bit um phallic .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Um '",
        "'User Interface': ' Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Dual use , perfect .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Sorry , sorry .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So now we we have the  okay ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Wow .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and uh  the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And it's  the whole thing's made of rubber , is that '",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Rubber .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,  . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be  and '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'so we said the back side round , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It l does look like the  curvy'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm . Hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . And it's spongy as well . '",
        "'Marketing': ' I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'So  so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the  on the cover we just have the very basic things .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Huh . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three  there would be numbers in in the  on the actual one .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Six seven eight nine . I like that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and  like the previous one and the next one .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So where's the volume ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'The volume is is scrolling .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's on the side .'",
        "'User Interface': 'On the side ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Ah , you did get that in then ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'this one . Yeah you just do it like this .'",
        "'Marketing': 'mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh okay ,  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'See ? So the volume is  you just scroll , but then once you flip it open ,  okay , there there you have the screen'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and and you have the mm  spinning wheel with options to choose .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Uh no , we we'd not put   '",
        "'User Interface': 'A mute button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well ,  we'll have this on the screen , on the display .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Y or you could have it  so you  on the wheel if you '",
        "'Marketing': 'On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , but the but the mute  yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But if you hold it in ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay , cool .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay , yeah , okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So that  that solves the whole mute issue .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .  And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' no .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You can't really see it in the interface .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm , very good .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So I think it '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And it's   with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Cool .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' We ran out of resources here , so . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'In the actual one .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You can have a look . '",
        "'User Interface': 'So if you have questions .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Very good , let's have a look .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Test it out . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , oh , we hold the remote .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I hate Play-Do , it's just minging .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Marketing Expert .'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer  prepare the evaluation of the new design .  Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like  so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Cool , so these are what they are . Oh '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm dots , never mind .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , just prepare one now .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It will be red , too .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I reckon it '",
        "'User Interface': ' S seven was th the maximum , yeah ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it does .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I would think yes , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . I mean '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m  model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'But that's gonna be a problem ,'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So bu it's it's not a huge problem ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I th I think it's not  it's not like it's a pen .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because i i it is operatable .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so they just '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'but they can normally do most things right-handed ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right .'",
        "'Marketing': 'so I would say it's not such a big issue .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So maybe we need to put  that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'What do you what do you all think ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Six .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , I think I think for um '",
        "'User Interface': 'I mean . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I mean most people are right-handed , so in  in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want  might want to um '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'One more thing is that i'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'They '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so it opens on the side . So  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No , yeah , but mm but we have it  nicely  with the hinges here  yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah yeah yeah , I mean  yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So it won't be a problem ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So you guys can decide wh whether '",
        "'User Interface': 'it will be  and it will be  it won't be heavy .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oops .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , but we  which makes it kind of really big , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah well yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The length is gonna be difficu'",
        "'User Interface': 'but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah um '",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Uh this this kind of uh makes it more '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Because '",
        "'User Interface': 'S uh slightly smaller .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So you have to keep that side flat .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right . Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Um  okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , we have a locator .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No , we're gonna put it like  we've got th there's the locator dot .'",
        "'Marketing': 'There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a  that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm that you stick on T_V_ .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'doesn't it ? To make it beep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or a buzzer .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some  to make some sounds , so  yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yep .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Fabulous . D_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Intuitive , completely intuitive . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . If  uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and it's  I th I think it's '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I'd say six ,cause the  I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Intuitive .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , and I mean d'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Might be '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But it  and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So , should we maybe say f a five'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So l'",
        "'Marketing': 'and say it is intuitive ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Five ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ?'",
