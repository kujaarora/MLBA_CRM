Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but '",

        "'User Interface': 'Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .'",

And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .'",

Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .'",
