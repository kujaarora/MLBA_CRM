        "'User Interface': 'Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I dunno . Um . Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . Okay , jolly good .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so '",
        "'Project Manager': 'What's a double curved one ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So   Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where  for example titanium , you can't use it for  if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh s so if d'",
        "'Marketing': 'People . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'okay . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . Um scroll buttons , as well .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Well , we're gonna go with  I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it's a constraint . Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ?  If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . If that makes sense .'",

Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double  rubber double curved case ? '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I'll have a Big Mac , please . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's   we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it  if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go  I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . So , either '",

        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Let's go crazy .  And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be  so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Simple , yeah . Chip on print . It's a bit  .  Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The infra-red . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ?  Y um  what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm '",
        "'Project Manager': ' so it sounds '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit .  I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Fo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . Totally . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um we wanna go for an i i all '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So let's not go for the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'so long as it works ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , yeah . I agree .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . S yeah , push buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think push-buttons is '",
        "'Project Manager': 'What about what ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm , I dunno . Be cool .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Th the the  speech recognition um option is  it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product .'",
        "'User Interface': ''cause uh  The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um  That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'But , I mean , it's not '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns  comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh , it just gives an answer .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? '",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh , then then '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Just if you are really lonely , maybe . '",

        "'Marketing': 'I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Channel five . And then it switches on .'",
        "'Marketing': 'channel five , and it will change .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No , tha that w that w that would be more promising .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It it's just a remote that talks to you .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh .  I mean to certain cues .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh , then  forget about it . Oh right okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the '",
        "'User Interface': ''Kay . Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Basic battery .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay . So we'll go for the battery . Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Double ?'",

        "'User Interface': 'So rubber rubber keys , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and that's fine ?'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
