    "Presentations on the prototype": [
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay um , welcome to our detailed design meeting . I'm pretty excited . Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . Okay um the agenda  we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . We'll look at the finances and finally a  do a production evaluation and close . So , starting off with the um last  the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Right , do you wanna start ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one . Um we have our colours not  are not fixed , but this is the general shape . Um it's  you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even  I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push  if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if  uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . That's our number one prototype . Um do you wanna present the potato ,'",
        "'Project Manager': ' like a little lightning in it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'or shall I present the Martian ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The little lightning bolt in it , very cute .'",
        "'User Interface': 'um  What  We call that one the rhombus ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I could '",
        "'Project Manager': 'The v the rhombus rhombus ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'uh the rhombus .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That's the rhombus , yep .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's'",
        "'User Interface': 'it's a '",
        "'User Interface': 'how can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it , that's the potato .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um on , off ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh that would be one of your channels , basically ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah we turn it off .'",
        "'User Interface': 'yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um not really ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'If you pressed and held it maybe .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'If you like held it down , that would be on off .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . On off , that's a possibility , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top .  We have the five preset seeds  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . So , that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Let's pass .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh-huh . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Uh the menu select button . '",
        "'Marketing': 'I forgot .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Very interesting .  I think that one's my favourite .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So that's  So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mmkay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'maybe with with less contrasts on it . Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but '",
        "'User Interface': 'Would  Yeah , but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Now that was one thing that we brought up over email . I don't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it  it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss '",
        "'Marketing': 'But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's really  Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? Do you think that would be conceptually possible ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think '",
        "'User Interface': 'I think it would be difficult technologically ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 's so it's  I'm not quite sure how it would work'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's true , mmkay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we  so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . Okaycause  well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I feel like this is simil  or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , justcause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm yeah ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Ah ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'that's good , that's good .'",
        "'Marketing': 'there we go .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Here , stick it on .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Put an extra the button on   .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Sure .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well do we w  like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh okay . Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That was  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So where '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Do you need this'",
        "'Project Manager': 'or just write on the white board ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . I am worried about like um using a menu . Um in that  like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well that  on the iPod , for example , you just  every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Good point .'",
        "'User Interface': 'This is , it's  the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Could these be used for going to submenus'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'or '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Maybe  yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Okay . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mmkay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . So like in my opinion the   for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah it's it's really deep . Hold on . Takes a little while to get excited to load . That  the Excel thing is pretty cool .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , that is pretty neat .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I love Excel ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Here , like , basically'",
        "'Project Manager': 'it's one of my favourite programs .'",
        "'Marketing': 'it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , see . You didn't miss out that much .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I see , mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Spongy .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I learned a lot actually .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh wow . This one was cooler . I got a whole table and everything .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and  I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this  you just need to talk about the case .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's really interesting though . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We had a lot of the um  otherwise the technology  today was kinda cool .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That was really neat how I got emails'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and '",
        "'User Interface': 'We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I  yeah . If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but '",
        "'Marketing': ''Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but with only four people it doesn't really make sense .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But I thought we were good orally .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think if you had a larger group '",
        "'Marketing': 'Get crazy .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'as that's not as necessary to have .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': ''cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Because we're all gonna be working in different places .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We  if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh we we worked together ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'um and how we could like improve on the on the design .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Cool .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It was fun .   So well done with the management , I felt well managed .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh thanks .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's kinda fun .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And I  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Sorry . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' That happened to me all the time though .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points  at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting  we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but we were able to do it regardless , so . I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'This is what we'll do .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I found that we did  we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Especially last time ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ,  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'you know what I mean ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'like we we couldn't answer every single question .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Um but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right . And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and not sort of made me really like , ooh I don't know  , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . I had so much information and so much to talk about .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the  when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um . I'm a little  I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a  um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .  that was something like  in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and  things like '",
        "'Project Manager': 'About  yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'so there was no  we could be like yeah , it has it included .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think we were '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'There was no way for us to have'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Considered the re'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'written down that it was really there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well'",
        "'Project Manager': 'it's interesting that they '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm , yeah  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um  we weren't provided with information to discuss that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'that  I just don't know what it is , but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I dunno . I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway . You'll loseem in your pocket ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'like you just will forget that  or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'there's always ways to lose things .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But , I mean  I am notorious for losing my keys ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I just  I guess I've just never lost the remote . I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night  and couldn't find them .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''Cause I was putting groceries away .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's funny .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Oh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Can't get in . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Can't get in , look all around the kitchen . Definitely in the vegetable drawer .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's funny .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But I guess it'scause we don't carry remotes around that much .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Can't really take it into the other room .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a  robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh a G_P_S_ system ,  internal G_P_S_ .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh man . Here you go .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' We should make one that walks by itself . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Although if it's sitting still for too long .  Yes I '",
        "'Marketing': 'That really could get up and walk away  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': '  Or little    Or just just a wheel , you know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Just if you   like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll  . '",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' zoom  Yeah . Hmm . All kinds of possibilities .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . Okay . Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes . I decided to  you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Just gonna make  I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Cause that seems a little more useful .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Wow .Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , I guess  How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Most of it , mm-hmm . I added slides , um I added a couple slides each time ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but that was about it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay . Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides ,cause I would just get slides with titles on them'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Ah yeah. .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so  I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three .'",
