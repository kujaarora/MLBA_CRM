        "'Project Manager': 'Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up .    Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it s kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input ,s always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions .  And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'No Nathan's fine .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Good .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's either Nathan or participant two .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Nice .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay . Um ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Nice .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so  Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look  if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um  the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So we'll have to look into that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , brilliant .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um and just a little note there ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Right . Nice .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record  if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part  use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Interesting .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' M Maybe '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm . Good call .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Choose it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Interesting question .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''S a bit of a challenge question .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is  I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about  I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some  you know , say our  the one '",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",

        "'Marketing': 'current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now  basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting  they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um  that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' Tomatoes . '",

        "'User Interface': ' I like it , I like it . '",
        "'Marketing': 'uh not something I I've come up with a  though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use  we can use a rubber as part of the case ,'",

So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new  I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um  with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .'",
