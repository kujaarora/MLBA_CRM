Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes .  Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of Kay I'll just give you a minute ,cause it looks like you're making some notes .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Um well , the function  of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus .  And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And we can decide if that's what we want ,  , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is  fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ready .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process ,cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the  users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want  they've  are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they  it needs to be snazzy and it  but yet simple .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Wait .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So that's really what we need to do . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So '",
        "'User Interface': 'And that meaning what ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like  They like I guess use the buttons a lot .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'My team wasn't very clear .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh , I'm sorry .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Only use ten percent of the buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': ' That's okay . I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh , right .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'much like any small appliance like a cellphone ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Lost .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and they  we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go  we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'S'",
        "'Marketing': 'but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's okay . It's very important . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes , it is important for the remote control world .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Could be , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh possibly .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Like  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I'",
        "'User Interface': 'Channel , volume , power .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think that's a pretty good guess though .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I would assume so .'",

        "'Marketing': 'I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . It's okay . '",
        "'Marketing': ' But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Next slide ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'User-friendly .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in  like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And also we found  our team found that speech recognition is  it's like an up-and-coming thing they really  consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And so just to  just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'I guess so , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': ' to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Oh , that'd be lovely .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Didn't they  um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would  the remote would beep so if you have lost it '",
        "'User Interface': 'It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You know like go to the base .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We could definitely include that if we wanted to .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Help me .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .'",
        "'Marketing': 'What exactly is a smart chip ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I wouldn't think so ,cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Ready ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um yep , nothing here .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um power source , I figured , batteries ,cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um a large on-off button ,  demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . Um smart chip that perverts  uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh this is my fifty second design .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'This is just like a rough schematic .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'So this is the internal workings .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red ,'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , ho homing device . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But you got a base .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Do you think people'll really go for that though ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's useful for the remote phone .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Because '",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source  Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , then we could '",
        "'Marketing': 'Do w'",
        "'User Interface': 'If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'You could um  we could hook it up .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It wouldn't copy onto the the thingcause it's black ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So  basically older people don't really care .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and'",

        "'User Interface': 'Well '",
        "'Marketing': 'just sitcoms and stuff . Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , then then do you put the voice recognition  do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'So '",
        "'User Interface': ''cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .  and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'A certain phrase then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there .'",

        "'Marketing': 'You definitely need '",
