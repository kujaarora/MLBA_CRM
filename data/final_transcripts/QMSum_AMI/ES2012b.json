Um  I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Sorry .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as  in addition to their existing remote controls . Um  and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . Um .  Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um  the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . Um and and then we'll  as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh  Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh  I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer  they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um  the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . Um now this doesn't  necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that  we've already said that it must be simplecause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm  uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . Um okay , so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh'",
        "'Project Manager': 'um notes sent out and uh etcetera . Okay , so  we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . Um again I   there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to  who who who thinks they would like to go go first ?'"

        "'Marketing': 'That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the  our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um  everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are  how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly  . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um  they they don't uh  they , yeah , they only use  they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh  I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour .  Uh again , seventy five percent is  seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just  they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume  .  And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons ,cause uh wh if we got a remote that like  well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the  uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very  aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control .'",

There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you  it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a  you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'then that would be easier . Um  and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was  when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it  maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .

Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is  that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um  Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source ,  uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . And um  oops . Uh-huh . This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for .

Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually   what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And so my personal preferences  I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface  um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . And that's pretty much it .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm . '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",

Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one  some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . By which time  I mean when all's said and done , the digital television  will be taking over in that time scale . Um'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll giveem a new one .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh , cool .  Yeah , fair enough .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um it's , you know , it's  what it saves in cost and you know there there's a  well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it '",

        "'Project Manager': 'um  right , so I'd  I need to sum up very quickly here um .  We're looking at extreme simplicity . We're looking at a radically different shape . Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the  I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if  clearly only need the main functions . Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and  there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers .  Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ?'",
