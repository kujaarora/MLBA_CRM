Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . This is a meeting on functional design . Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . Um I did  took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's  I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . Okay ? Is this ap everybody agree with this ?'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions .  Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . And go to that one . Um as you can see it was this earlier today . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting  Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ?Kay .'",

    "The menu function and interaction with other tools of the remote control": [

        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Mm we need to move this . Who wants to go f first ?  That's as far as it goes .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Excellent , thank you .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'She said we didn't need to screw it in .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Okay , that looks good .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's doing its thing . There we are .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright . Thank you very much . Um . One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar  of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players  although it makes immediate sense to  have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh  will only benefit from the positive feedback  from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um  fifty percent  I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this  there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Could  can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've '",
        "'Marketing': 'Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'um that teletext is outdated um'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .  Well I think we can  I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise  for the I go everywhere line .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . So these market research uh uh questionnaires  looked into your your uh concern about technology'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them  would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if  and you know , the the designers ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Is that a large enough target market to target it ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well , I I I think  especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah . To   Um yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or eight million .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an '",

        "'Marketing': 'Exactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something  uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Uh , mm .'",

        "'User Interface': 'That ? Right , technical functions design . Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has  it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access  it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Still , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .  Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research ,  and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas withem . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared .  And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and  which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the  which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped  I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard .  So we want an energy source which is there . And we've got to think about what that might be .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm-mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions .  Um and then we have the the user interface . Oops . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty .  Thank you .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .  Okay . Right . But those things  as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of  what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um  because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million ofem ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing ,'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'you just  if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need  gonna need to hit .'",
