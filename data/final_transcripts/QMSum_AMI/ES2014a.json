So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . And they're also good for exercise as well . You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired .

And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . Other than the fact that they keep dying ,'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .  Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit . And therefore making a profit margin of uh  well not actually a profit margin it's uh  because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit .

        "'Project Manager': 'So uh any any thoughts ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um we're looking for a device that is uh  What was the other things you said there ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'I've Okay . Yeah . Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well .Cause there's quite often lots and lots . And um sometimes uh they sort of  remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So  whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room .'",
