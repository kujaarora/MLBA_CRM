We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . So . So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? Uh have there been any uh changes ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay right , let's get started . Um basically the uh for the  Um I'll  back actually . For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So um yes  including the power s supply as well . Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um .  There's a dynamo . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up  um . There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . Um that's one option ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but I think that was gonna cost a little more . And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is  Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal  for like uh like modern computer . Um there's a scroll wheel which is  you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each .

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um  Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t'",
        "'Marketing': 'I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , maybe we should see yours first .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Cool . Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one  that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' You know  yourself . '",
        "'Marketing': ' So  '",
        "'Marketing': 'So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''Kay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . And apparently , the fashion trends  are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'which is contrary to last year , apparently . I presume it must have been not not spongy last year .'",
        "'Marketing': ' So we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that .  Right , so that'll be it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe a banana or courgette or something . '",
        "'Marketing': 'How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons ,cause you're can mis-direct people . And I would've thought the functionality cause the people get cheesed off by things  by having to read instructions et cetera , so .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Maybe yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Now ? Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'and it wouldn't confuse the numbers .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Stand-by button . No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But what are they gonna be next  Yeah . What are they gonna be next year . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'maybe '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm . S'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh  I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That means you're constantly changing your production schedule ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I'm not '",
        "'Project Manager': 'and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . I don't know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' to something which is maybe more universal .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well '",
        "'User Interface': 'But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'um even if the design kind of changes , '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah d d But if '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Well . Yep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe still with a rubber design we could '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this  Or was  the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? It was , wasn't it ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So the '",
        "'User Interface': 'It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um oh no no no'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh right , that fits , doesn't it ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . That's the way round . If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . Which makes sense .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Rubber buttons require rubber case . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh so , yeah . The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ?Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay  you want to basically mint them out'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and especiallycause then you could make it something that  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , you might be limited in space , that  yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' would or not . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'whether that would just increase the costs ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'make it more complicated .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's possibly it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but you could change the the way it looked .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah and then you could have  Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , that's true .'",
        "'User Interface': 'but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah you you could do a colour change , so therefore you would yeah yeah  I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in  rather than all in black'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? '",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But uh so '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it is a possibility , um .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes oh that's true'",
        "'User Interface': 'We haven't really seen that yet'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh okay yes'",
        "'Project Manager': 'uh that might no'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'that is '",
        "'User Interface': 'It might  and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well not necessarily , because you could have your company uh  We're we're meant to be finishing up . You could have your company badge and logo . I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but I'm  Yeah . I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , people see you with it all about and'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah I suppose ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .'",
        "'Marketing': 'i if it'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's uh in in the house , isn't it , I suppose .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case '",
        "'Marketing': 'I think '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So don't change case .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Change case colour . And we're sort of saying no to that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Did we decide on the rubber case ? The spongy feel , or did we think that that might go as a trend ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well , it was different last year . The trend was different last year apparently . It was not not spongy feel . But  I don't know whether the trend will change . I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , less likely to '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Sounds reasonable .   If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So then th th that would '",
        "'Project Manager': 'so that you could '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'orcause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and then have the standard rubber buttons as well .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . There's flat ,'",

        "'User Interface': 'I'm not exactly sure what these things look like .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . '",

        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'See how uh  Let's just get that bigger . See how uh the one  Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'No you're not connected to me anymore .  '",
        "'User Interface': ' That doesn't help . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'One one thing to cons'",
        "'User Interface': 'Shall I just turn it round for time ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um  by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other'",
        "'Marketing': ' That should come up .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can  if you can store them up on top of each other .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um it's not very clear up there ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",
        "'User Interface': 'but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm yep .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?'",
        "'Marketing': ' That's what I was trying to work out .'",
