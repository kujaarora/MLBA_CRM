Well , since it's the  through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them .

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um  The  whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product .

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , uh that's probably it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . So we only ne we only need two for that .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Ne uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um  Well you got you got twelve .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Okay , so tha'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so we're still within budget on that . Um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep , that makes sense .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'That's without   Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So shall we do a  Well , um '",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , so  Uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep  I would s'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be  a different shape . Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped .  I don't know . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different   seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You mean of '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um '",
        "'Marketing': ' And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I don't know .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'because at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make  next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah so it's a  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Well you could  Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . '",

        "'Project Manager': 'amount '",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . So , we've  what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of the plastic .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , we've  the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Is it '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That  yeah , that was uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'The rubber .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'that was just about all .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um  So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some  maybe lost something on the innovation side ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'But uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I dunno . And  that is like the most standard type of button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I mean , we've got  we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , ease has certainly stayed .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'Do you think   Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And the speech feature .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , the speech feature .'",
        "'Marketing': ' And then , the corporate identity .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think we've cut just about the same . We've maybe lost  Hasn't it  It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect '",
        "'Project Manager': 'How it would play out , yeah . Oh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean , it's maybe not . I mean '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Okay , well I mean '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more . Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We cou Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': ' But then what colour would you make the R_s ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' just the the company logo . So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . So you're  in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I'm still not quite sure we've established that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Don't think so .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I just '",
        "'Project Manager': 'But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter .'",
        "'User Interface': 'We got the logo off the web browser .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver   the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Uh-huh .Cause you've got sort of  we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You could put in another '",
        "'Marketing': 'Another colour .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or would that be t'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So you were talking about uh um  We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Which m may or may not be the case .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , yeah . Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?'",
        "'User Interface': ' Um , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , maybe we've m '",
        "'User Interface': 'Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a  plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , well '",
        "'Marketing': 'So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright . Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': ''Cause you  Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
