And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe , it could  it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like that .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . The light  it will .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or or was it gonna make a noise ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . But when the alarm's not '",

        "'Marketing': 'Here I am .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I'd be tempted to '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well the thing is , if it was  had an alarm system ,'",
        "'Marketing': ' Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It would have to be in the market'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I though w it was gonna make a noise .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Alarm ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah but you still couldn't see it .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Sorry Heather .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Totally .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it has to be  yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'just because it's  we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Do  Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an  just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter .'",
        "'User Interface': 'That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah but you don't have to press zeros .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I don't know why . '",
        "'Marketing': 'You could just press six enter ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh okay . Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And then like twelve , enter .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And  or sixty six enter , y'",
        "'Marketing': 'or one two enter .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Alright , aye .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um , okay so we can  '",
        "'User Interface': 'I'd say w yeah one .'",
        "'Marketing': 'we'll say yes it's uh one ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Your thumb might get a little bit uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , that's what I was thinking .'",
        "'User Interface': 'yeah . I don't think it will f'",
