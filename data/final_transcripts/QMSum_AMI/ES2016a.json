In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .'",

Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um  sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . That's about it .'",

In the functional design phase I'm  I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on .

Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh  well um functional design um . Um do we have  um any ideas of of   maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .'",

Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for .

        "'Industrial Designer': 'So '",
        "'Project Manager': 'unfortunately we've got about five minutes here  to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . Let's see here . What if we had what if we had not only um  say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . So the grip is  No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then  flat uh  And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm , that's true .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's  don't make it too stable  uh .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh  functional .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um  Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you  had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'right ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Kay . Um '",

        "'Project Manager': 'True .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but um it's rather about an instinctual thing ,'",
