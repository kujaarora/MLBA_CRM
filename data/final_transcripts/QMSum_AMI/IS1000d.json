        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mmkay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf  when they see this stuff .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'which you can  which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it   that it   i'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Seven , eight , ei eight Euros .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So this one model'",
        "'Marketing': 'Can I see ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'Uh-huh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it doesn't actually have buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': ' So that uh   then what we look t'",
        "'Marketing': 'Did you wanna see ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Yeah no you can carry on ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'This is a model ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I just look how it feels all .'",
        "'User Interface': 'yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Just I'm '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah actually , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I really want to talk to it .'",
        "'Marketing': ' It won't talk back . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'But  .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' So but but continue with your uh'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh so well'",
        "'Project Manager': 'mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'then the this is the  a more a little uh smooth'",
        "'User Interface': 'and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And so they have more space actually'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh  uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Play , pause .'",
        "'User Interface': 'yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it '",
        "'Project Manager': 'From D_V_D_ player to television or something .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . I really can change it ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Instead of having many switches , y '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'This is the orange button , the  microphone .'",
        "'User Interface': 'or in the button th here ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'An yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'okay . And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . Yeah'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Crazy dis designer ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'you know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'okay . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Design enter  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah yeah yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . It's basically to do that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'which shouldn't be shouldn't be '",
        "'User Interface': 'Actually when you are watching the T_V_ ,  when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh actually  well .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' That th that's true .'",
        "'User Interface': 'you know , uh you want to uh  and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , more robust .'",
        "'User Interface': 'it's more robust that way . Uh yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And you have very good chances '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh  it's it's sixteen Francs .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It  Sixteen Euros .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Sixteen Euros sorry .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it's well outside the budget then .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Then it's out of budget .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But w'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so'",
        "'User Interface': 'Three Euros .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'three Euros sorry . And um '",
        "'Marketing': 'That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No no no , part of that , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Part of that  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Mmkay . Hmm . '",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well uh if you  we can have  if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I think th th yeah we should  stick with uh a number of keys'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because if we add too much then'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'it's too '",
        "'User Interface': 'it it should not be cluttering up everything .'",
        "'Marketing': 'What's this one on the side ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Ah that's for the  it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Locati . Location .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Ah okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and as well as it's like a blinking one'",

        "'Marketing': 'Okay .  Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well'",

        "'Project Manager': 'just do it quickly if if we al already  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so   These are the things we identified as being important . Um  the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now ,  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out . So the first one was really  very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ?Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . Mm . Yes .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . So maybe a three or a four .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'One me um we hope '",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah it's a '",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",
        "'User Interface': 'actually the user has to put some effort to do  use that actually ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'it's not so easy , like this one the normal .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Is quite easy yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So so I think th three is good . Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah that's true . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being  applying to the the demographic'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah . That's  it's still  Ye'",

        "'User Interface': 'But why do you want to cover that actually ? In that uh w in the mod'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yes but that  maybe  Well we can just say'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'one .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'When you look at this w , this u uh item , '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ca l we are just  when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So is it possible ?'",
        "'Marketing': ' But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'That'll be  then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'he he he I I'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'no ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And I dunno '",
        "'Marketing': 'we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . And the chip .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sorry the chip's up there already .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' A'",

        "'User Interface': 'Or we could even replace them by buttons actually .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? I dunno , I'm just asking .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm '",

        "'User Interface': 'Okay so we can get rid of it'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , it's true yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . I'",
        "'Marketing': 'For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there .  Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I  think we have to come to a decision now , just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'right ? Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes . Yes .  One man one vote .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . '",
        "'User Interface': 'I think but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' We need to be . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Bu y you're a power voter  uh veto anyway as Project Manager .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm , I know , but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that .'",
        "'Marketing': ' well we have to make a decision now , that's it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'You've  you you agree .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons  .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use .'",
