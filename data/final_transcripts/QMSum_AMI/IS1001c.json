Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest  next task , to have  to be done before the next meeting . So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . We also decided to have a wheel to change channel  previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by  or U_I_ '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request .'",

So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . And um  yeah we can change directly .'",

        "'User Interface': 'This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ?'",

        "'User Interface': 'Should have the two sides .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So if  the left , we have  the op'",

        "'User Interface': 'Wheel  Wheel buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it's okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . So you cannot see them .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , you you will get used to it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be  Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . No you you  I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well . I think this doesn't change that much .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Maybe . Yeah .'",

So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc  the product .
