We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Thank you . What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most  what they what they find more more interesting , more  or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels ,cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Stable thing , that's right . To have  ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think everyone has has agreed that it's  that it could be quite a useful um thing , so .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'mm-hmm , mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': ' But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because it's it's  the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': ' But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and  well '",
        "'Marketing': 'What's a turbo button ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh  Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It con it controls the speed ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going  if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's enough .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and it's still very  it may even be for most  for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um  you know , what other buttons do we want ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I mean we could have  well , I guess you need an on and off switch ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Switch on . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . So sounds crazy . I like crazy ideas .'",
        "'User Interface': ' That's why you're a marketing guru . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , of course . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , that's the thing , as  have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think that '",

        "'Marketing': 'I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah I think so .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control'",

        "'User Interface': 'It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition  the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your  if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t'",
        "'User Interface': 'I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . So there should  we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm . Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'As  or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so that  That's right . Okay . Yeah . So these these were the component selection and these things . We can go to the next slide . And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device  wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Cause that , you know , that  sometimes people like to collect um you know things that  of a similar type .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Well '",
        "'Marketing': 'Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So you're having a basis station . Okay . Your  usually your remote sits on that . So you  and it's  that's why it can have chargeable batteries . Now let's say '",

So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost .

        "'User Interface': 'So '",

        "'User Interface': ' Exactly . Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know  because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make  um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .'",
