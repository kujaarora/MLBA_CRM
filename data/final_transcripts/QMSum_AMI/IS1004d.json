        "'Project Manager': 'So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of  detail design of the product of the remote control . Um  So here is the agenda for today . Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . And we'll have um  presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro .  Okay . So let's go . Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting .  So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . We went through the use of wheels and but buttons .  And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . Okay . Um . Good . So guys let  this uh wonderful thing .'",

        "'User Interface': 'bana sit  the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . We've got the two uh  uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath  we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh  through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you  quickly rather th'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . But normally with uh  it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .'",

        "'Marketing': 'And the volume button will will become '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's up to you , means .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well in fact b both will be  could be useful , navigating through teletext .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Now that  Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .'",
