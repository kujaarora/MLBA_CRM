        "'User Interface': 'Hello .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So , uh we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . So , who wants to start ? Okay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Trend . Yep . Can you pass the mouse , please .  Oh okay , that's fine .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Turn .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you  present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  Um  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .  From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So ,  I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'What does it mean , spongy ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh sort of um squishy .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Like soft , or something ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um . Yeah soft ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'like a uh like a sponge .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Like a sponge .  Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' I don't know . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay . I will see .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it .  Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our  of th the Real Reaction company . Um .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah , uh yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' That's it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Easy to use , is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . It's less important , right ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Less important .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and half important as technology is easy to use . So .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' So , Hamed , can you  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . The second one . Could you please show the presentation number three .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .'",

    "Discussion about use convenience": [
        "'User Interface': 'Uh yeah . Okay .  Okay . So I am going to talk about  a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um  generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be  we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control .  Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can  which should be taken easily in hand . It should not be completely like uh a cube . It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Exactly .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . I dunno if I can explain well . But uh just inside . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . Okay . That's mine .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I'm person two . And which one , uh probably the first one . I'm not sure but check the first one . I  Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'This one , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , that's it . Just  It's only this slide ? Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just '",
        "'Marketing': 'Inch .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , seven seven inch T_  T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh ,  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'This is this is the stuff that I can use to '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oops .'"
    ],
    "Engineering requirements and size of device": [
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay , so the  this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . So there will be some circuit uh for the power . So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh  And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So at least seven to seven . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It doesn't matter . Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . So this will be T_F_T_ . And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here . Interface to the microphone . Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the  once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be  which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to  Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes  if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I dunno .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around .  maybe after .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'A Yeah , that's all from me .'",
        "'Marketing': 'This seven inch T_F_T_ screen ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'how big is it in reality ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well , seven to seven inches .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So like that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's quite big .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No , I don't think it's seven by seven ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it's seven  the diagonal is seven .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'To be honest , I was '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah yes  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But I mean even even that is like this big .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .  I dunno I dun I dun One each '",
        "'Project Manager': '. But , yeah ,  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but it's seven inches . But I I think we can we can cut it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Let's go . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , no no problem ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' So let's cut the T_F_T_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay , so '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So so for the same price we have four screens now  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'These technical engineers , huh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So , what's the size of the device ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Is it  Can you hold that , or ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' What user wants . He wants a small remote control , or ? Uh uh with big buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's difficult .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' A sm'",
        "'Marketing': 'But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow  Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': ' So maybe you can finish your presentation ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and afterwards we will discuss about all this .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but  Oh , okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe this  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay thanks  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's it . Okay . So .   No . Uh , so I think we have a lot  We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?'"

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so no problem in energy , I think .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So  Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But we have to use the solar cell .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh like '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Otherwise not .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Uh one two '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So like three to five centimetres ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I dunno exactly , but .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'S Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know .'",
        "'Marketing': '  Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The television lights . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ .'",

        "'User Interface': 'and it should not be very heavy also . And I prefer to  is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . So we c it's like like some joysticks . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large .

Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the  it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and '",
