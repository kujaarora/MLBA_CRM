        "'Industrial Designer': 'So uh mm I'm thin uh  I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible  things we hav we can use . Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box  would uh look look like .'",

Okay so can you go down uh  So , wha what I think  for now  is  we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the  . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication .

        "'User Interface': ' So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can  the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end  in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some  to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the  on the remote controller , right ?'",
