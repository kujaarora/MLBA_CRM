        "'Project Manager': 'This '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Components design .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique  to to store the energy .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We also um  we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex .  But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the   from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work  in a cluttered uh  uh environment .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are  mm will be uh very happy to have a  a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip  that are uh well cheaper .

        "'User Interface': 'That that's what it means by kinetic .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",

Mm so somebody  some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real  so so that could be an option as well .

So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm  yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So  But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the  currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f  customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah but '",
        "'Marketing': 'So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': '  Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen'",
        "'Marketing': 'And accordingly you can just increase or decrease .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so  i i it's not really worth to get  to have the image if you don't look at , so .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I if  Mm . Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that has to be checked out .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and then you t turn  you just press lef increase or decrease button'",
        "'User Interface': 'and the same for the volume and the channel , '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'with the help of speech recogniser you can '",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean ,  better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and also with the speech recognition .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Mm .  Yeah . A and '",
        "'Marketing': 'And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and  when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You will listen to a peep ,  special peep .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Where  , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or it could be also something like this ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Put '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But you don't you don't have to move the the charger .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'because there are problems with a voice command .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm . Mm .  Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You have to keep it  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean charger would be fixed'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'because it's always with electricity plugged .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . There's  mm . Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that's right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'That  we can  what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because uh every time you're off the computer   the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where  to the charger .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's an good reminder ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . So you will never get lost   yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah that's right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe for some people   lazy people .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y'",
        "'Marketing': 'And of course the final point is a fancy look .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'They were ugly .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' They '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think we should have something  it '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well the last one with the um  yeah with the two parts was uh  original , so '",
        "'User Interface': 'With uh two two two parts controller .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean  uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and  use it , you can't avoid him .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But you can have an button for child lock .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even  '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Yeah . Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just  yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .  these are probl yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' . So if he  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So for mm '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these  could be included .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .  I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because uh if you want  uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'but if  name the channel by by name '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and and uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh  basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah it's  yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and suddenly  the screen the channel goes to twenty five .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That's right , yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean the the  you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah but well  okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it's better to have some prefix  before the number .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah something , some code .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm mm . Well I '",
        "'Marketing': 'That will be too big .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or just '",
        "'Marketing': 'And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Uh ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because you have to s t uh a ch'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , it's convenient for the user .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or maybe '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Then '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'The  uh uh mm .  Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I I think that I have  mm mm  I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh  if  when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the  you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , the  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train  you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh , okay . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I uh I also '",
        "'Project Manager': 'By associating each channel with the name or '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah yeah ,  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Because uh I remember when I was a  young child with my sister we  yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time'",

If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name  bad uh reputation for our company .'",
