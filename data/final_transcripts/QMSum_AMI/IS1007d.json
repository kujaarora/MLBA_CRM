        "'Project Manager': ' So  .  So let's see the  what did you prepare .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? Mm the shared folder .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Sh share folder for th your presentation ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes . We have a presentation .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because I have here '",
        "'User Interface': ' Uh   So I got the participant uh three . W uh  . Three . It's the final design , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay just one  .'",
        "'User Interface': ' S so so I discussed with Guillaume .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .  Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Right .  And uh  so we have   and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or  control module . And detachable big buttons for all people um . So  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes  . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the  for the speech recognition system here .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And here the the switch that control if you want '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Why you why you you put it in the the side ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I I I think uh it's the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's not a good place maybe  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah but '",
        "'User Interface': 'No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well so it's a microphone array .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh it's very costly , microphone array  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' No'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'it's just a single microphone , and you  I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah  yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'How much does it cost this one ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars'",
        "'User Interface': 'For the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Fifteen dollars ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' fifteen dollars ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah it's above it's above the budget .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but uh well it's not it's not uh  yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh  voila .'",
        "'Marketing': 'The cost would be le reduced .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah the  and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'How many b battery is there ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'How many , excuse me ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Battery .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'A_A_ rechargeable batteries .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Rechargeable of course ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah rechargeable batteries .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because we have the charger .'",
        "'User Interface': 'We have the charger so it's no problem .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah and you just '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So one one battery ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'On uh yeah one battery .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Is that two or one ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's kinetic reserve .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Actually uh it's a flexible thing .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You just n uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Now what is the whole day rating for that ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'Whole day's rating .'",
        "'Marketing': 'What type of battery ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'if you uh like it's exist .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .  At uh  yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Then the next time you pick it , oh'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'it works  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah just explain the button uh Norman .'",
        "'User Interface': 'yeah alright . This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is  getting destroyed .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'If you'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh okay this is new prototype uh  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah it's '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also  .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So basically th it's the same uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh-huh and also the switch .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah  .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'No four dollars , it's   good . '",
        "'Marketing': 'And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh no'",
        "'Marketing': 'because that's a major that's a '",
        "'User Interface': 'th actually th we'll come to that point in our '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So '",
        "'Marketing': 'and if you disable speech recognition system then ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' so Norman will explain to you  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And we will we will serve the charger with this ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah of course mm  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Th they  either these with the  uh the the charger any'",
        "'Project Manager': 'With the remote control .'",
        "'User Interface': 'in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay so the price of the charger included in the '",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': '  Thank thank you  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And so mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'The price should be below twelve and a half Euro .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah . Yeah'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well that's  so '",
        "'User Interface': 'but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to  people are willing to pay more for good design .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We have we have just  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah people are willing to pay more ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The price of selling is twenty five Euros .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And the price of production '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'so is uh modular .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah yeah ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Something like customised . Yeah'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'or  the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You want a microphone to put in the  speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm hmm hmm hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So '",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's pretty flexible in the yeah price  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But '",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh yeah yeah you should present that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'that that you ca you can add up  to the  to your remote control'",
        "'Marketing': 'And this is other one ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up  they come up with their modules ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm hmm hmm hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'they just plug in it'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and they can have all the control they want here .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and it acts like the previous one ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'you just plug in and it works .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with  the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here  oop '",
        "'User Interface': 'it's very robust  , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The titanium'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Titanium .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and so it's very uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that's fine .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_  and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the  or is it '",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'that's the reminder part . Yeah and um  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm hmm hmm hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so  sorry ? '",
        "'User Interface': 'And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And  and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from  yeah  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And also like the  and the fancy designs yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What what's '",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe we can improve more on the design but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What's the price to p to produce ?'",
        "'User Interface': ' uh this is the  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well so the price to produce  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'With with with the charge ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh it's about it  The  without without the charger'",
        "'Marketing': 'With the charger ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_  , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We don't have charger .  '",
        "'Marketing': ' I think we can use Excel  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' It's about  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'We don't have all the options  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Charger we don't have charger here either .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No it's'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But it's just if you want all functionalities .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'it's below the the the budget .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Excuse me ?'",

        "'Marketing': 'So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is  first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find  these are the latest fashion updates , and so this  in Paris and Milan  they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Spongy spongy . Mm mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm  mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But the the problem is that uh   is it robust to mishandling ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'We have  you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'A sponge . '",

        "'Marketing': 'Four .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .  Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well it's it's the same for both so  I will give a five , six . '",
        "'User Interface': ' Mm . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Five with L_C_D_ and '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well five also uh  Norman please . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh  '",
        "'User Interface': 'from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now  and another innovation we have is simplicity and  simplicity , few buttons , we've uh   A lot of functionalities .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'With lot of functionalities .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So that is uh that is uh for both th'",
        "'Marketing': 'So without L_C_D_ ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all  well this is a biased judgement '",
        "'User Interface': 'because we designed them .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .  Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'For L_C_D_ .'",

        "'User Interface': 'For both . It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' six , let's go for six .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Without L_C_D_ .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Both .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I  there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh no innovative yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'So we can't go  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Talk about '",
        "'User Interface': 'We haven't really uh determined  what are  actually actually'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design '",
        "'User Interface': 'it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? '",
        "'Marketing': 'No it's like this ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So let's remove it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh then '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes exactly .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'This is the problem .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n'",
        "'Marketing': 'L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a'",
        "'User Interface': 'But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean that depends upon your design , so '",
        "'User Interface': 'Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_  we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean '",
        "'User Interface': 'we give what the customer uh wants , right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which  do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so '",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so I will give a six for the easy to use .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah I think '",
        "'Project Manager': 'No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .'",
        "'User Interface': 'sorry . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .  Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': 'without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , it's cheaper to produce .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .  S '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh if the the  well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that's right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the  s similarit for the old people they want simplicity ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah yeah that's right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so that's why  we have the parental module . Uh we can ha have  build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'so  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Six .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'W uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Or you want it to be six ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think it's the same .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um six .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes as you say , with better uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Without L_C_D_ .'",
        "'Marketing': 'S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' yeah . And to improve the the look .'",
        "'Marketing': 'As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and it's going to be much simpler to use .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so let's go back to our laboratory and  '",
        "'User Interface': ' To improve on the design .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What a what what about the sys speech recognition ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'So .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' what about the integration of speech recognition ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . Right ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's going to be an optional .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah so it's optional with the  okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's an optional .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more  likes more to have a spongy uh  remote control than '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it will be  I think i'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Or ma yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and so that their parents can't use it  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so mayb better if you have all this in the same '",
        "'Marketing': 'In the same set , yeah ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'and and individual buttons to make them work .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children   when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  uh will be optional .'",
        "'User Interface': 'what do you think uh ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple  or how many couples have a T_V_'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': 'or to the number or singles who have a television .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So based on that I think '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .  But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it inc increase .  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well you can   if you had uh something li'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it i increases .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh no ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because if you if you add uh something  well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah yeah'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the  functionalities um on the same module , but uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .  Mm . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'On the same P_C_B_'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well well the other aspect is that if  in the  when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the  you're gonna keep the same customer ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that's right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So so '",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean you could just provide with an optional  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So it's something like a Microsoft product  update .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' And and we we we we we we don't want that .'",
        "'User Interface': ' We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m '",
        "'Marketing': 'Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be  can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah , it depends on the v production . '",
        "'Marketing': 'And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well so '",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah'",
        "'Marketing': 'Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think we are   yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um  but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or uh it could be like this  the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh well but it's a bit complicated to  if if if you need machines to  different machines to um ah well '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . What we can change is to propose the  customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin'",
