        "'Industrial Designer': 'Agnes , yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes and uh evaluation criteria . The finance , it's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . Then uh closing . So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so  Okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm , okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So I handle to '",
        "'User Interface': 'I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So shall I go to  sorry .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh thank you , so you did a PowerPoint presentation , good for you . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep . S Okay , let's go to A_M_I_ .'",
        "'User Interface': ' It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but '",
        "'Project Manager': ' So in two or three or '",
        "'User Interface': 'Three . Um .  No it's '",
        "'Marketing': 'Probably . Technical pa I would think .'",
        "'User Interface': 'think it's the last one . No , then this is  the la yeah , that one , final design .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Ha .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Um okay , can I have the mouse ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Thanks . Alright , so from  when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable ,cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off .  Um , so  to unveil our lovely product . This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display .  Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . So up  volume up , down  volume down . The green are the channel changing .  S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um and uh I could '",
        "'User Interface': ' Oh yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah the d'",
        "'User Interface': 'Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the  under the flip .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes , okay . Uh-huh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So that will be the safe , so p any  the chip  it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone  to '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Uh it's it's  Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible ,cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand .'",

        "'Marketing': 'I don't wanna say . Louder .  Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yes . So it's maybe good idea .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin . '",
        "'Marketing': ' No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been  not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice .'",
        "'User Interface': '  Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes . Yeah  .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . I mean this is plasticene .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'There's only so much you can do . We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well .  But  And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",

So here you can uh look like uh the energy  and uh  dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's uh  actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh  below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . I think it's a good figure . '",

        "'Marketing': 'Display in . But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh  the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that  has to be taken in into consideration .'",

But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Although  since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it  this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep . '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav  gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Yep .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the  of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now .'",
