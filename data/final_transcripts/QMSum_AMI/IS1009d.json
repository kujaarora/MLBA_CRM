        "'Project Manager': 'and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . Um .  Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . The industrial designer um presented her uh  thoughts on the issue . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . Uh and of course a circuit board . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse  morse code related relays the  uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'She would like uh  this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with  to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . She feels that's really what people want today . And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes  from the last meeting . Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .'"

        "'Marketing': 'Okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that  maybe little things we haven't thought of .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm . Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So we have to get some input from those people .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Um , next slide please . Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it .'",
        "'Marketing': ' So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Fee selling .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um so they'll be our main selling points . So um  th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . Okay , so um the shape um I think is a  a one . That's really , really excellent shape . The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's  I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right  the scale is one to seven . I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And our colour I think is great . The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um I just realised one thing .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Ah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Eight , eight twenty , yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Eight twenty so '",
        "'Marketing': 'And so we've got  we've still got four euros to go  to spend .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We have um four euros , yeah'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean  four thirty .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Well um that's '",
        "'Project Manager': 'But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So um we just have to beware of that . I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes , yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , still .'",
        "'Marketing': ' As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no  that that was not um included uh  that there was no room for any special features , okay ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Included , yeah . Hmm ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'hmm'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So to beware of that . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh , well I isn't this my last slide ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I dunno .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes it is . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Go ahead . I think that was my last slide , yeah . Um . Mm okay . And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that , um .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Why ? Wh why you need that up ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Hmm ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there .  Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think you can make it there .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mmkay . You ready . So now we're all supposed to say what we think . Um okay so on shape I gave it a one . Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Worse , okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um what do you think the shape is ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'One .'",
        "'Marketing': 'One , okay , and Be Betsy ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes I think uh shape is one .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , even my  yeah , shape is one .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay , uh-huh one , okay . And how about on size ? On size '",
        "'Project Manager': 'You  you gave it a four .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um , I dunno . I think I would give it at least a two .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'One .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , even I think it is one . It's quite small .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay . Okay '",
        "'Marketing': 'you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Um and then how about  how we doing on colour ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Colour uh I '",
        "'Marketing': 'Colour , I gave it a one .'",

        "'Marketing': 'I really like all those nice bright , warm colours .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I  I like the colours . One .'",
        "'User Interface': 'One . Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'One .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , one .'",
        "'Marketing': 'One , one , one , okay . And how about the feel ? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh , I think I would give it a two .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay , I gave it a three , two ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'I'll give three .'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah ? Three .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh maybe two ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Two , okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more  is  are more tangible so from that point of view'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but um  I'll give it a three .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Two , okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh three , mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Three ? Okay . Well , um . It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': ' But um otherwise I think we're  we're ready to go to  go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh . Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . Um . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'We can always improve , yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe we can  yeah , include some more buttons and uh um'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes , features .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah features . We can make the buttons  few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think  I  I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . Well then again if we're gonna um  do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Yeah , definitely .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes . Voices .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes . Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . Maybe we can put that all on one button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And maybe '",

        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm . No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh um we need uh  you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser .'",

        "'Marketing': 'we didn't use that enough .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes , we could . Uh , it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes .'",
