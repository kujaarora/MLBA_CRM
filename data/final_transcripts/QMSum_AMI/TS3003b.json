We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So  Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So'",

        "'Marketing': 'some things . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Then these are the  This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um  Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So  Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um  The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality  As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons .Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily . Um  Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .'",

The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product .

        "'Marketing': ''Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Kay . So we can '",
        "'Marketing': 'That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . That's right .'",
        "'Marketing': 'which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe . Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and  But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Cause it can be '",
        "'User Interface': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because I think that's uh  That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'or very  '",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's a nice requirement . Docking station .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So we're just gonna focus on the extras ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think so .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'like to have extra in a new remote control .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's a good point . Um  You said they easily get lost as well .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that was what I suggested .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .'",
        "'Marketing': 'You have it on '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . So'",
        "'Marketing': 'So you know where it is .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,cause'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . It will be too much as well .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'it's uh  '",
        "'Marketing': 'I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Based .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Just a small screen'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's a good idea . So '",
        "'Marketing': 'with two '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Some extra info . Feedback .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But I dunno if that would'",
        "'Project Manager': 'As the small screen .'",
        "'Marketing': 'that would fit into the costs .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Extra button info . I think that should be possible as well . Um  let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions  Yeah .Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Mm . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
