And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . '",

Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria .  Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that .'"

Then there's the volume and channel selectors . Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to  one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .'",

        "'Marketing': '  Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': ' We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Is it impossible to '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The margin will get too small . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . So '",
        "'User Interface': 'But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say  Or you can take the single chip .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I don't think so .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It would be a be a pretty rigid one .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh attractive uh o options .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it's uh difficult as well ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or b'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but '",
        "'Marketing': 'Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No remote . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . Then w'",
        "'User Interface': 'Scroll-wheel's one .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' That's '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because then we save ten buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No , it '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then we have five and one .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced  W uh , we're getting close . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We're getting closer .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': 'But how does scroll-wheel work here ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then you will  Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright . It's gotta scroll and push .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But  Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You could just not scroll for a half a second .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So you won't need a button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think that would be like the end of our usability .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' But it would definitely crop cost , a lot .'",
        "'User Interface': 'D yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah , but  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And we need the battery .  And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And we can save a Euro by a flat design . That's an option we can '",
        "'User Interface': 'Ja ja .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yep .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then we're almost there .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . So if we '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah but I think that's  That is a big advantage ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'So  Yeah '",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah it's a big advantage .'",

        "'User Interface': 'But um , it's '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Can we use  can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think so . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'If you push it three times ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there .'",
        "'User Interface': '  But if you push the teletext button twice '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . '",
        "'Marketing': 'I think that's the case on most '",
        "'User Interface': 'It's uh  One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah that's not really that '",
        "'Marketing': 'Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No .'",
        "'Marketing': 'who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .'",
        "'Marketing': 'True . True .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . Mm eraser ? And we put uh  Looks a bit odd maybe . '",
        "'Marketing': 'That's a pretty big scroll wheel .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That is   Something like that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . And these are two buttons then .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We could make two buttons out of that . And just um  If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . That's really a good good idea , I think . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'More obvious .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . That's right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So if we '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . That's m that's better .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . So '",
        "'Marketing': 'So this is five buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Y yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm yeah . Uh yeah , and then you can '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'you get a a much smaller remote .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's right .'",
